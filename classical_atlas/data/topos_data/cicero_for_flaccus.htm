                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi017:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the greatest perils of this city and empire, in the most important and terrible disasters of the republic, I was repelling slaughter from you, your wives, and your children, devastation from your temples, your altars, from the city and from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, with Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, the companion and assistant of my counsels and my dangers, I used to hope, O judges, that I should some time or other be an assistant of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> towards obtaining honour, rather than an advocate to defend him from calamity. For what reward of dignity could there be which the Roman people would deny to him, when it had always given them to his ancestors; when Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> had imitated the ancient glory of the <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> family in delivering his country, nearly five hundred years after the existence of the republic? <br /> [2] But if by chance there had existed at any time any detractor from this service, any enemy of this virtue, and envier of this renown, still I thought that Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> would have to encounter the judgment of an ignorant mob, (with no real danger, indeed,) rather than that of most wise and carefully chosen men. I never, indeed, imagined that any one would bring danger upon, or devise plots against, his fortunes, by means of those very men, by whose influence, and under whose protection, the safety, not only of all the citizens, but even of all nations, was at that time defended and preserved. And if it was fated ever to happen that any one should devise mischief to Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, still I never thought, O judges, that <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, the son of a most virtuous man, himself a man of the fairest expectations and of the highest dignity, would adopt an accusation which is more suitable to the hatred and madness of wicked citizens than to his virtue and to the training of his early years. Indeed, as I had often seen well-founded enmities with citizens who had deserved well of their country, laid aside by the most illustrious men, I did not think that any friend of the republic, after the affection of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> had been thoroughly tried, would take up a fresh quarrel against him without having received any injury. <br /> [3] But since, O judges, many things have deceived us, both in our own affairs and in those of the republic, those things which must be borne, we bear. This only we ask of you, — that you will consider that the whole strength of the republic, — the whole constitution of the state, — all the memory of past, and the safety of present and the hope of future time, hangs and depends upon your power, upon your votes, upon this single trial. If ever the republic has had need to implore the wisdom, the gravity, the prudence and the foresight of her judges, she implores it now, — she implores it, I say, at this present time. </p>                        </div>

Every other refuge of good men, — every other protection of innocent men, — every bulwark of the republic, wisdom, assistance, and laws, has failed. [4] For whom else can I appeal to? whom can I cite? whom can I entreat? The senate? Nay; the senate itself implores assistance from you, and feels that the confirmation of its authority is submitted to your decision. The Roman knights? You yourselves, the fifty chief men of that body, will declare how far your sentiments are in unison with those of the rest. Shall I appeal to the Roman people? That body has delivered over to you all its power over us in our case. Wherefore, unless we can maintain in this place, and before you, and by your means, O judges, I will not say our authority, for that is lost but our safety, which hangs on a slender hope, and that hope our last, we have no place of refuge beyond to which we can betake ourselves. Unless perchance, O judges, you fail to see, as yet, what is the real object of this proceeding, what is really at stake, and what is the cause, the foundations of which are being now laid. [5] The man has been condemned who slew <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> when he was bearing his hostile standards against his country. What reason is there why he who drove <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> from the city should be exempt from fear? That man is demanded for punishment who discovered the proofs of the common destruction of all which was then being planned. Why should he feel safe who took care to produce and divulge those proofs? The partners of his counsels, his ministers and comrades are harassed. What are the leaders, and chiefs, and principal men of his party to expect? We should then see whether at that time all good men were my guides or my companions in preserving the common safety of <br /> ******[frBob1] <br />He preferred saying they were strangled. [frBob2] <br />What did my friend Caetra wish? [frBob3] <br />And what did Decianus? [frBob4] <br />And I wish that my enemies, and those of all good men, would rather attack me; I wish it really was mine. The senate to a great extent <br /> **[frBob5] <br />O ye immortal gods! that <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a><br /> ***[frMed] <br />[ What was the use of bringing forward foreign evidence,] when his domestic life and his natural disposition was notorious? Therefore, I will not, O <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, allow you to assume this law and this condition as applicable to yourself and to the rest for the future, and to us at present; [so as to lay down a rule that we are to accommodate our defences to the will of the prosecutors, and not come to those assertions to which our cause of itself leads us.] <br />When you have branded his youth, when you have stigmatized the rest of his life with stains of infamy, when you have brought forward the ruin of his private affairs and his disgrace in the city, and his vices and crimes in Spain and Gaul and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, in which provinces he lived in no great obscurity, then we shall hear what the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a> and the Lorymeni think of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>. But the man whom so many and such influential provinces wish to be saved, — whom many citizens from all parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> defended, being bound to him by intimate connection and old friendship, — whom this the common country of us all holds fast in her embrace, on account of her fresh recollection of his great services, — him, even if all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> demands him for punishment, I will defend, — his enemies I will resist. What if it is not all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> that demands him, nor the best part of it nor even any part without bribery, nor of its own accord, nor rightly, nor in a manner according to custom, nor with truth, nor with any conscientious regard to justice or honesty? If it duly demands him because it has been persuaded, and tampered with, and excited, and compelled to do so, — if it has backed this prosecution with its name impiously, and rashly, and covetously, and with great inconsistency, speaking only by the mouth of the most needy witnesses, and if the province itself has no grounds to complain with truth of any injuries done by him; still, O judges, will these statements, heard with reference to a very brief epoch diminish the credit due to actions which we really know, extending over a long period of time? <br />I , therefore, as his defender, will preserve this order which his enemy avoids; and I will pursue and follow up the prosecutor, and of my own accord I will demand the accusation from our adversary. What is it, O <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>? Have you at any time been able to stigmatize the youth of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, who has passed his time, not in the shade, nor in the common pursuits and training of those his age? In truth, even as a boy he went with his father, the consul, to the wars; and yet, even as to this very fact you accused him of something because [something appeared able to be said so as to excite suspicion.] </p>                        </div>

He was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> a military tribune when Publius <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> was the general; not a word is said about that. He was quaestor to Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> in Spain; not a word has been uttered about his quaestorship. He was present at the greater part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=demonym long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretan</a> war, and went through all its hardships in the company of that consummate general. The accusation is dumb with regard to this period. His discharge of his duties as judge during his praetorship, — a business of great intricacy, and affording numberless causes for suspicion and enmities, is not touched. Nay more, though it fell in a most critical and perilous time of the republic, it is praised even by his enemies. “Oh, but damaging evidence has been given against him.” Before I say by whom it was given, by what hopes, by what violence, by what means the witnesses were urged on, and what insignificant, needy, treacherous, audacious men they were, I will speak of their whole class, and of the condition in which all of us are placed. In the name of the immortal gods, O judges, will you ask of unknown witnesses in what way the man decided trials in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, who the year before had sat as judge at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? And will you yourselves form no conjectures on the subject? In a jurisdiction so various, many decrees were issued, — many desires of influential men were set at nought; and yet, what words, (I will not say of suspicion, for that is often false, but) of anger or indignation were ever once uttered against him? And is that man to be put on his trial for covetousness, who, when employed on a business affording numerous opportunities for such conduct, shunned all base gain, — who, in a city much given to evil speaking, and in an office surrounded with suspicion avoided, not only all accusation, but even a single hard name? I pass over points which I ought not to pass over that in his private affairs no covetous action, no eagerness about money matters, no sordid conduct in the management of his estate can be alleged against him. By what witnesses, then, can I refute these men except by you? [8] Shall that villager from near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a>, — a man not only a stranger to us, but not even known among his own neighbours, — teach you what sort of a man Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> is, whom you yourselves have known to be most modest as a youth, whom our most extensive provinces have found to be a most conscientious man and whom our armies know by experience to be a thoroughly brave soldier and vigilant general, and of a lieutenant and quaestor most moderate; whom you yourselves, being witnesses on the spot of his conduct, have judged to be a thoroughly wise and consistent senator, a most upright praetor, and a citizen wholly devoted to the republic. </p>                        </div>

And what witnesses are they? In the first place, I will say that they are Greeks, (that is the case of them all.) Not that I, for my own part, would be more inclined than others to refuse credit to that nation; for if ever there was any one of our countrymen not averse to that race of men, and proving himself so by zeal and good-will, I think that I am that man, and that I was so even more when I had more leisure; but there are in that body many virtuous, many learned, many modest men, and they have not been brought hither to this trial. There are also many impudent, illiterate, worthless persons, and those I see here, impelled by various motives. But I say this of the whole race of Greeks; I allow them learning, I allow them a knowledge of many arts; I do not deny them wit in conversation, acuteness of talents, and fluency in speaking; even if they claim praise for other sorts of ability, I will not make any objection; but a scrupulous regard to truth in giving their evidence is not a virtue that that nation has ever cultivated; they are utterly ignorant what is the meaning of that quality, they know nothing of its authority or of its weight. [10] Where does that expression, “Give evidence for me, and I will give evidence for you,” come from? is it supposed to be a phrase of the Gauls, or of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=ethnic long=-4 lat=39>Spaniards</a>? It belongs wholly to the Greeks; so that even those who do not understand Greek know what form of expression is used by the Greeks for this. Therefore, when they give their evidence, remark with what a countenance, with what confidence they give it; and then you will become aware how scrupulous they are as to what evidence they give. They never reply precisely to a question. They always answer an accuser more than he asks them. They never feel any anxiety to make what they say seem probable to any one; but are solicitous only how to get out what they have got to say. Marcus <a href=/people/7893 target=_blank>Lurco</a> gave evidence against <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, being angry (as he said himself) because his freedman had been condemned by a decision of his involving infamy. He said nothing which could injure him, though he was eager to do so; for his conscientious regard to his oath prevented him. [11] And yet with what modesty, with what trembling and paleness did he say what he did! How ready to give evidence was Publius <a href=/people/1598 target=_blank>Septimius</a>; how angry was he about some former trial, and about his steward: yet he hesitated; yet his scrupulousness was at times at variance with his anger. Marcus <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> was an enemy to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, because, as <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> had thought it wrong for one publican to decide on the case of another publican, though the case was ever so evident he had been removed from the list of judges. And yet he restrained himself; and brought nothing into the court which could injure <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> except his own inclination to do so. </p>                        </div>

When a Greek witness comes forward with a desire to injure a man, he does not think of the words of his oath, but of what he can say to injure him. He thinks it a most shameful thing to be defeated, to be detected, to allow his enemy's innocence to be proved. That is the contest for which he prepares himself; he cares for nothing beyond. Therefore, it is not the best men, nor the wisest, but the most impudent and talkative men who are selected as witnesses. [12] But you, even in private trials about the most trifling matters, carefully weigh the character of a witness; even if you know the person of the man, and his name and his tribe, still you think it right to inquire into his habits. And when a man of our citizens gives his evidence, how carefully does he restrain himself, how scrupulously does he regulate all his expressions, how fearful is he, and anxious not to say anything covetously or angrily, — not to say one word more or less than necessary! Do you think that those Greeks are so too? men to whom an oath is a joke, evidence a plaything, your opinion of them a shadow, men who place all their credit and profit and reputation, and triumph telling the most impudent lies. But I will not spin out what I have got to say. Indeed, my speech would be interminable if I were to take it into my head to unfold the faithlessness of the whole nation in giving evidence. But I will come nearer home; I will speak of these witnesses whom you have brought forward. <br /> [13] We have got a most zealous prosecutor, O judges, and an enemy in every respect violent and furious against us. I trust that he may be of great use to his friends and to the republic; but at all events, he has undertaken this case and this prosecution, as if he were impelled by some most extraordinary eagerness. What a company attended him while pursuing his investigations! company, do I say? rather, what an army! what profusion! what expense! what prodigality was there! And though these statements are of service to my case, still I do not make them without apprehension lest <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> should think that I am seeking by my oration to make him talked about, or to excite odium against him, in a business which he has undertaken for the sole object of acquiring credit. </p>                        </div>

I will only beg of you, O judges, if you have heard anything yourselves by common report and in ordinary conversation about force, and violence, and arms, and troops, to recollect it and to remember, because of the unpopularity of such conduct, that by this recent law, a certain number of companions has been fixed as the greatest number that ought to attend a man while prosecuting such an inquiry. [14] However, to say nothing of violence, what conduct is this? which, since it was adopted according to the privileges and customs of prosecutors we cannot impeach, but still we are compelled to complain if it. I mean, first of all, the making a statement which has been bruited abroad over all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, (different people having had regular districts assigned to them, in which they were to spread the report,) that Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, because he is a most zealous enemy to Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, had begged of <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, his father's and his own most intimate friend, to prosecute him on this charge, and that he placed at his disposal for the furtherance of this business, all his own authority, and influence, and resources, and riches. And this appeared all the more probable to the Greeks, because a little before they had seen <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> in the same province with <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, and on terms of great intimacy with him. And as the authority of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> is great with every one, as indeed it ought to be, so especially is it predominant in that province which he has lately delivered from the war which <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> and kings were waging against it. He did this besides: those who did not wish to leave their homes he terrified with a summons to give their evidence; those who could not remain at home, he provided with a large and liberal sum for travelling expenses. [15] And thus this young man, full of ability, worked on the wealthy by fear, on the poor by bribes, on the stupid by leading them into mistakes; and by these means he extorted those beautiful decrees which have been read to you, — decrees which were not passed by any formal vote or regular authority, nor under the sanction of an oath, but carried by holding up the hand, and by the loud shouts of an excited multitude. </p>                        </div>

For our ancestors, those wise and upright men, would not permit the public assembly to have any authority to make laws; they chose that whatever the common people decided, or whatever the burgesses wished to enact should be ordered or forbidden, after the assembly was adjourned, and after all the parts had been properly arranged, by the different ranks, classes, and ages, distributed in their tribes and centuries, after having listened to the advocates of the proposal on which the vote was to be taken, and after the proposal itself had been for many days before the people, and had had its merits inquired into. [16] But all the republics of the Greeks are governed by the rashness of the assembly while sitting. Therefore, to say no more of this Greece, which has long since been overthrown and crushed through the folly of its own counsels; that ancient country, which once flourished with riches, and rower, and glory, fell owing to that one evil, the immoderate liberty and licentiousness of the popular assemblies. When inexperienced men, ignorant and uninstructed in any description of business whatever, took their seats in the theatre, then they undertook inexpedient wars; then they appointed seditious men to the government of the republic; then they banished from the city the citizens who had deserved best of the state. [17] But if these things were constantly taking place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, when that was the first city, not only in Greece, but in almost all the world, what moderation do you suppose there was in the assemblies in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>?

An assembly was summoned at the request of <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>. <a href=/people/2211 target=_blank>Athenagoras</a> came forward, and, being a Greek among Greeks, he said a good deal, not about his fault, but in the way of complaining of his punishment.

For formerly, when a prosecutor had said anything with bitterness and vehemence, and when the counsel for the defence had made a supplicatory and submissive reply, the third step expected was the appearance of the witnesses who either spoke without any partisanship at all, or else they in some degree concealed their desires. But what is the case here? [22] They are sitting with the prosecutor; they rise up from the prosecutor's bench; they use no concealment; they feel no apprehension. Do I complain of where they sit? They come with him from his house, if they trip at one word, they will have no place to return to. Can any one be a witness, when the prosecutor can examine him without any anxiety and have not the slightest fear of his giving him any answer which he is unwilling to hear? Where, then, is the oratorical skill, which formerly used to be looked for either in the prosecutor or in the counsel for the defence? “He examined the witness cleverly; he came up to him cunningly; he scolded him; he led him where he pleased; he convicted him and made him dumb.” [23] Why need you ask a man questions, <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, who, even before you have pronounced the words “I ask you,” will pour out more assertions than you enjoined him before you left home? And why should I, the counsel for the defence, ask him questions, since the course to be taken with respect to witnesses is either to invalidate their testimony or to impeach their characters? But by what discussion can I refute the evidence of men who say “We gave,” and no more? Am I then to make a speech against the man, when my speech can find no room for argument? What can I say against an utter stranger? I must then be content with complaining and lamenting, as I have been some time doing, the general iniquity of the whole prosecution, and, in the first place, the whole class of witnesses; for that nation is the witness which is the least scrupulous of all in giving evidence.

I will come in still further, — he who has done it is not present; he who is said to have paid the money is not brought hither; no private letters are produced; the public documents have been retained in the power of the prosecutors. The main point of my argument concerns the witnesses. These men are living with our enemies, they come into court with our adversaries, they are dwelling in the same house with our prosecutors. [24] Do you think that this is an examination and an inquiry into the truth, or an endeavour to fix a stain, and bring ruin upon innocence? for there are many things of such a sort, O judges, that even if they deserve to be neglected, as far as the individual whom they more immediately affect is concerned, are still to be dreaded, because of the state of facts of which they betoken the existence, and because of the precedents which they afford. </p>                        </div>

They complain that money was levied from the cities under the name of money for a fleet. And we admit, O judges, that that was done. But if this be a crime, the guilt must consist either in the fact that it was not lawful so to levy money; or in the fact that the ships were not wanted; or in the third alternative, that no fleet put to sea while he was praetor. That you may see that this levy was lawful, listen, I pray you, to what the senate decreed, when I was consul, in which it did not depart at all from the former decrees of many years running. [The resolution of the senate is read.] The next thing is for us to inquire whether there was need of the fleet or not. Is it then the Greeks or any foreign nations who are to be judges of this, or your praetors, your generals, your commanders-in-chief? I indeed think that in a district and province of that sort which is surrounded by the sea, dotted all over with harbours, and girt with islands, a fleet is requisite not only for the sake of protection, but as an ornament of the empire. [28] For there were these principles and there was this greatness of mind in our ancestors, that while in their private affairs, and as to their own personal expenses, they lived contented with a little, and without the smallest approach to luxury; where the empire and the dignity of the state was concerned, they brought everything up to a high pitch of splendour and magnificence. For in a man's private affairs he desires the credit of moderation, but in public affairs dignity is the object aimed at. But even if he had a fleet for the sake of protection, who will be so unjust as to blame it? — “There were no <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>.” What? who could certify beforehand that there would be none? “You are taking away,” said he, “from the glory of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>.” [29] Say, rather, that you yourself are increasing his difficulties. For he destroyed the fleets of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, their cities, and harbours, and places of refuge. By his surpassing valour and incredible rapidity of motion he established a maritime peace; but this he neither undertook nor ought to have undertaken, — namely, to submit to appear worthy of prosecution if a single <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a>'s boat was anywhere seen. Therefore he himself in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, when he had terminated every war, both by land and sea, nevertheless levied a fleet on those self-same cities. And if he then thought that step was necessary, when everything might have been safe and tranquil through fear of his name, while he was still in those countries, what do you think that <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> ought to have decided on and to have done after he had departed? </p>                        </div>

What? were there not all this time cavalry on the sea-coast? for that is the surpassing glory of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, — first of all, that those <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> who, when the conduct of the maritime war was first entrusted to him, wandered about straggling over the whole sea, were soon reduced under our power; in the next place, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> is ours, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> is occupied by us, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, through the instrumentality of king <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemaeus</a>, is reduced to a state in which it can venture to do nothing; moreover, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, owing to the valour of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, is ours; that the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> have now no ports from which they can set out none to which they can return; that all the bays, and promontories, and shores, and islands, and maritime cities, are now contained within the barriers of our empire. <br /> [31] But if, when <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> was praetor, there had been not one <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> at sea, still his diligence would not have deserved to be blamed. For I should think that the reason of there being no <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> at sea was, because he had a fleet. What will you say if I prove by the evidence of Lucius <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, of Lucius <a href=/people/2084 target=_blank>Agrius</a>, of Caius <a href=/people/2506 target=_blank>Cestius</a>, Roman knights, and also of this most industrious man here present, Cnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, who was an ambassador in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> at the time, that at that very time in which you yourself affirm that there was no need of a fleet, numbers of men were taken prisoners by the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>? Still, will the wisdom of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, as shown in raising crews for the fleet, be found fault with? What if a man of high rank, a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395269Uadr class=place long=26.9346 lat=39.504>Adramyttium</a>, was even slain by the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, — a man whose name is known to nearly all of us, Atyanas the boxer, a victor at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>? and this victory is considered among the Greeks (since we are speaking of their wisdom) a greater and more glorious thing than to have had a triumph is reckoned at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. “But you took no prisoners.” How many most illustrious men have had the command of the sea-coast, who, though they had taken no <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> prisoner, still made the sea safe? For taking prisoners depends on chance, on place, on accident, on opportunity. And the caution which shows itself in defence has an easy task; being aided not only by lurking places in concealed spots, but by the sudden fall or change of winds and weather. </p>                        </div>

In what then is it that we look in vain for the diligence of the praetor? Is it in the number of the ships or in the equal division of the expense? He demanded just one half the fleet which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> required. Could he be more economical? And he divided the expense according to the proportions settled by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, which was adapted to the division made by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, who, when he had arranged all the cities in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> according to the proportion that they were to bear of the expense imposed on the whole provinces, adopted a rule which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> and <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> followed in raising the necessary sums, and even to this day the whole sum is not collected. But he makes no return of it. [33] What does he gain by that? for when he takes on himself the burden of having levied the money, he avows what you wish to have considered as a crime. How then can any one be induced to believe that by not returning an account of that money, he deserves to bring an accusation on himself, when there would be no crime at all in the business if he made the return? But you deny that my brother, who succeeded Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, levied any money for the purpose of crews for the fleet. Indeed, I am delighted to hear this praise of my brother Quintus, but I am still more pleased at other and more important reasons for praise of him. He decided on a different course; he saw a different state of things. He thought that whenever any intelligence of <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> was received, he could get together a fleet as suddenly as he could wish. And lastly, my brother was the very first man in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> who ventured to relieve the cities from this expense of furnishing crews. But it is usual to think that a crime, when any one establishes charges which had not been established before; not when a successor merely changes some of the charges established by his predecessors. <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> could not know what others would do after his time; he only saw what others had done. </p>                        </div>

The crier with a loud voice calls for the deputies from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387298UAkm class=place long=29.7648 lat=38.6531>Acmonia</a>; one comes forward, <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>. Let them come forward. Have you compelled even the crier to proclaim a lie? I suppose this one deputy is a man who can support the dignity of his city by his sole authority; — a man condemned by decisions involving the greatest infamy in his own city; stigmatised in the public records; of whose disgraceful acts, and adulteries, and licentiousness there are letters of the Acmonians in existence; which I think it better to pass over, not only on account of their length, but on account of the scandalous obscenity of the language. He said that two hundred and six thousand drachmas had been given to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> at the public expense. He only said so — he produced no confirmation of his statement, no proof; but he added this, — which most certainly he ought to have proved, for it was a personal affair of his own, — that he, as a private individual, had paid two hundred and six thousand drachmas. The quantity that that most impudent man says was taken from him was a sum that he never even ventured to wish to be the possessor of. [35] He says that he gave it as a contribution from <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a>, and from his own brothers. <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a> was able to give such a sum; as for his own brothers, they are partners in his beggary. Let us then hear what <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a> says; then let his brothers themselves come forward; let them lie as shamelessly as they please, and let them say that they gave what they never possessed; still, perhaps, when they are produced face to face with us, they will say something in which they may be detected. “I have not brought <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a> with me as a witness,” says he. Give me the accounts then. “I have not brought them down.” At least produce your brothers. “I never summoned them.” Are we then to fear as an accusation or as a piece of evidence, what <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a> by himself affirms, a man needy as to fortune, infamous as to character, condemned by every one's opinion, relying on his own impudence and audacity, without any account-books or any one to support his evidence? [36] He also said that the panegyric which we mentioned as having been given by the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387298UAkm class=place long=29.7648 lat=38.6531>Acmonia</a> to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, is false; a panegyric, says he, which we ought to be glad to be without. For when that admirable representative of his city beheld the public seal, he said that his own fellow-citizens and all the rest of the Greeks were accustomed to seal at the moment whatever required it. Then take that panegyric to yourself. For the life and character of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> do not depend on the evidence of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387298UAkm class=place long=29.7648 lat=38.6531>Acmonia</a>. For you grant to me, (an admission which this cause especially requires,) that there is no authority, no consistency, no firm wisdom in the Greeks, and, above all, no proper regard to truth in giving their evidence; unless, indeed, henceforward there is to be this distinction made between the evidence and your speech, that the cities are to be said to have allowed something to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> when absent but are to appear to have neither written nor sealed anything suited to the occasion, so as to save <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, though he was present, though he himself undertook the management of the business himself, and though he alarmed them and threatened them, availing himself of the power of the law, of the privileges of a prosecutor, and of all his own private resources. </p>                        </div>

This panegyric, which has been produced by us, had been sealed with that Asiatic chalk which is known to nearly all of us; which all men use not only on public but also on their private letters, and which we every day see used in letters sent by publicans, and in letters addressed to each individual among us. Nor indeed did the witness himself, when he saw the seal, say that we were producing a forged document, but he alleged the worthless character of all <a href=/people/3539 target=_blank>Asiatics</a>, — a matter which we willingly and easily grant to him. Our panegyric then, — which he says was given to us because of that particular occasion, and by so saying in fact allows was given to us, — was sealed with chalk. But on that evidence, which is said to have been given to the prosecutor, we saw the seal was wax. [38] Here, O judges, if I thought that you were influenced by the decrees of the Acmonensians, and by the letters of the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, I should cry out, and argue with all the vigour of which I was master. I should call to witness the publicans; I should invoke the traders; I should implore the aid of your own consciences: the wax being seen, I should feel sure that the audacious forgery of the whole evidence was evidently detected and discovered, and laid bare to you. But at present I will not triumph too violently, nor be too much elated at this, nor will I inveigh against that trifler as if he were a witness, nor will I allow myself to be moved at all with respect to any part of this testimony of the Acmonians, whether it has been forged here, as appears likely on the face of it, or whether it can really been sent from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387298UAkm class=place long=29.7648 lat=38.6531>Acmonia</a>, as it is said to have been.

O the shepherds (I know not who they were), the literary shepherds! if they took nothing from those men except the letters! But we suspect that there is some other reason, and that we should not think those men quite destitute of all cunning. There is, I imagine, a heavier penalty at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaeum</a> than among other people, for forging or tampering with written documents. If they had produced the genuine letters, there was no accusation in them; if they produced forged ones, there was a penalty for such an act. They thought the finest thing they could do was to say that they were lost. [40] Let them be quiet then, and allow me to set this down as so much gain, said to turn to something else. They will not allow me to do so. For some one or other gives them a lift, and says that he, as a private person, had given him money. But this cannot possibly be endured. He who reads things from those public documents which have been in the power of the prosecutor, ought not to carry any weight with him; but, nevertheless, a formal trial appears to take place when the documents themselves, of whatever character they may be, are produced. But when a man, whom not one of you has ever seen, whom no living mortal has ever heard of only says, “I gave,” will you hesitate, O judges, to save a most noble citizen from this most unknown of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>? And this very man was lately disbelieved by three honourable and worthy Roman knights, when in a case in which a man's liberty was at stake, he said that the man who was claimed was his own kinsman. How has it come about that the man who was not considered a trustworthy witness as to his own blood and family is a credible authority concerning a public injury? [41] And when this Dorylaean was lately carried out to burial in the presence of a great multitude and numerous assembly of you, <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> tried to excite odium against Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> by imputing his death to him. You are acting unjustly, O <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, if you think that it is our risk whether your comrades live or die; especially as I think that this instance proceeded from your own carelessness. For you gave a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>, a man who had never seen a fig-tree, a whole basket of figs; and his death was to some extent a relief to you, for you lost a very voracious guest. But what good did it to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, as he was well enough till he came forward here, and who died after he had put out his sting and delivered his evidence? But that prop of your cause, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, was retained as a witness by us and examined two whole days; and, after he had said all that he wished, departed reproved, convicted, and broken down, and now walks about in a breastplate. That learned and sagacious man is afraid that Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> may burden himself with a crime, now that he cannot escape him as a witness; so that he, who, before the evidence was given, restrained himself when he might have got something by the deed, is likely now to add the guilt of an enormous crime to the charge of covetousness, which is only supported by false evidence. But since Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> has spoken at great length and with great acuteness concerning this witness, and respecting the whole charge which has reference to <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, we, as we originally intended, will proceed to the other points. </p>                        </div>

I have to do with a most active city, and one which is an admirable hand at keeping its accounts; a city in which not a farthing can be disposed of without the intervention of five praetors, three quaestors, and four bankers, who are elected in that city by the burgesses. Of all that number not one has been brought hither as a witness; and when they return that money as having been given to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> by name, they say that they gave him also a still larger sum, entered as having been given for the repair of a temple. But this is not a very consistent story; for either everything ought to have been kept secret or else everything ought to have been returned without any disguise. When they enter the money as having been given to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, naming him expressly, they fear nothing, they apprehend nothing. When they return the money as having been given for a public work, then all of a sudden those same men begin to be afraid of the very man whom they had despised before. If the praetor gave the money, as it is set down, he drew it from the quaestor, the quaestor from the public bank, the public bank derived it either from revenue or from tribute. All this will never be like a crime, unless you explain to me the whole business both with respect to the persons and to the accounts. [45] Or, as it is written in this same decree, that the most illustrious men of the city, — men who had had the highest honours of the state conferred on them, — were circumvented by him while he was praetor, why are they not present in court or why, at all events, are they not named in the decree? For I do not suppose that <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, who is pricking up his head, is the person here intended. For is he one of the most eminent of the citizens, when <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> brought him here for trial? a man who did not even receive his present commission to come on this deputation from his fellow-citizens by their voluntary choice, but who went all the way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383281LTmo class=place long=28.1016 lat=38.3237>Tmolus</a> to solicit it? a man on whom no honour was ever conferred in his own city; and the only business which ever has been entrusted to him, is one which is usually entrusted to the most insignificant people. He, in the praetorship of Titus Autidius, was appointed guardian of the public corn. And when he had received money from Publius Varinius the praetor for this purpose, he concealed it from his fellow-citizens, and charged the whole of the expense to them. And after this was made known and revealed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387272PTem class=place long=27.197 lat=38.6719>Temnos</a>, by letters which were sent thither by Publius Varinius, and when Cnaeus <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, he who was the censor, the patron of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387272PTem class=place long=27.197 lat=38.6719>Temnos</a>, had sent letters on the same subject, no one ever afterwards saw that man <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387272PTem class=place long=27.197 lat=38.6719>Temnos</a>.

Having made himself out in words to be a rich man, — though he had in reality nothing beyond the stock of impudence which you see, — he borrowed the money from <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> Stola, one of our judges now present a man of the highest consideration, who is acquainted with the circumstances, and not unacquainted with the man; but who trusted him on the security of Publius <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> Veratius, a most unexceptionable man. And to pay this loan he borrowed money of Caius and Marcus <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a>, Roman knights, men of the highest character. Here, in truth, he caught a weasel asleep, as people say; for he cheated <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, a learned man, his own fellow-citizen, who ought to have known him well enough; for on his security he borrowed money of the Fufii. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, without feeling any anxiety, goes away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387272PTem class=place long=27.197 lat=38.6719>Temnos</a>, as he said that he would pay the Fufii the money which he had borrowed on his security, out of what he received from his pupils. [47] For he, as a rhetorician, had some rich men for pupils whom he was going to make as foolish again as they were when they came to him, (for they could acquire nothing from him, except an ignorance of every sort of learning;) but he could not infatuate any one to such an extent as to get him to lend him a single farthing. Therefore, having left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> secretly, and cheated numbers of people by trifling loans, he came into <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>; and when <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> asked him what he had done about the bond given to the Fufii, he said that he paid the entire sum to the Fufii. In the mean time, not long afterwards, a freedman comes to <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> with letters from the Fufii. The money is demanded of <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> demands it of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>; however, he himself satisfies the claim of the Fufii who are at a distance, and discharges the security which he had given. He then prosecutes <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a>, in spite of all his fuming and shuffling, in a formal manner: the cause is tried before judges. <br /> [48] Do not fancy, O judges, that the impudence of cheats and repudiators is not one and the same in all places. This man did the very same things which debtors here are in the habit of doing. He denied that he had ever borrowed any money at all at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He asserted that he had actually never heard the name of the Fufii; and he attacked <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> himself, a most modest and virtuous man, an ancient friend and hereditary connection of my own, the most eminent and accomplished man in his city, with every sort of reproach and abuse. But after this voluble gentleman had delivered himself in that fashion with a prodigious rapidity of eloquence for some time, all of a sudden, when the evidence of the Fufii and the items of their claim were read, though a most audacious man, he got alarmed; through a most talkative one, he became dumb. Therefore, the judges at the first trial gave a decision against him, in a matter which certainly did not admit of much doubt. As he did not comply with their decision, he was given up to <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> and put in prison by him. </p>                        </div>

My brother as became his impartiality and prudence, decreed that if he demurred to the previous decision, he was to give security to double the amount; and that if he said that they were compelled by fear at the first trial, he should have the same judges again. He refused this, and as if there had been no trial and no decision, he began on the spot to demand back from <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a> the slaves which he himself had sold him. Marcus Gratidius, the lieutenant, before whom he went refused to give him leave to proceed with the action, but declared that he should adhere to the decision already given. [50] A second time, as he had no place anywhere where he could remain, he betook himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippus</a>, who never yields to his impudence, follows him hither. <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> demands from Caius <a href=/people/3072 target=_blank>Plotius</a>, a senator, a man of the highest character, who had served in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> as lieutenant some slaves, which he said he had sold under compulsion, at a time when an unjust decision had been given against him. Quintus <a href=/people/3213 target=_blank>Naso</a>, a most accomplished man, who had been praetor, is appointed judge; and when he showed that he was going to give sentence in favour of <a href=/people/3072 target=_blank>Plotius</a>, <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> left the judge, and abandoned the whole cause as if he had not had a fair and legal trial. Do I appear to you, O judges, to be dwelling too much on each individual witness, and not to be discussing the whole class of witnesses, as I originally intended? [51] I come now to <a href=/people/1783 target=_blank>Lysanias</a>, of the same city, — your own especial witness, Decianus, — a man whom you, as you had known him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387272PTem class=place long=27.197 lat=38.6719>Temnos</a> when a youth, since he had pleased you when naked, wished to be always naked.

You lent money to him while quite a youth, at great interest, having taken good security for the loan. You say that the securities have been forfeited to you, and to this day you detain them and keep them in your possession. And you have compelled this man to come forward to give evidence as a witness by the hope of recovering his paternal estate. And as he has not yet given his evidence, I am waiting to see what it is that he will state. For I know the sort of men that they are, — I know their habits, I know their licentious ways. Therefore, although I am certain what he is prepared to state, still I will not argue against it before he has stated it; for if I do, he will alter it all and invent something else. Let him, then, keep what he has prepared; and I will keep myself fresh for whatever statements he makes. </p>                        </div>

Where were the Pythodori, the Aetideni, the Lepisos, and the other men who are well known among us, and who are of high rank among their own people? where is their splendid and high-spirited display of the respectability of their city? Would they not have been ashamed, if they had been serious about this business, that <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a> should be called, I will not say their deputy, but even a Trallian at all? Would they ever have entrusted to this man as their deputy, — to this man as their public witness, Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> the hereditary patron of their city, whose father and ancestors had been so before him, to be ruined by the evidence of their city? This cannot be the fact, O judges; it never can be. <br /> [53] I myself lately saw in some trial a Trallian witness of the name of Philodorus, I saw <a href=/people/1481 target=_blank>Parrhasius</a>, I saw <a href=/people/7283 target=_blank>Archidemus</a>, when this identical man <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a> came to me as a sort of attorney, suggesting to me what I might say, if I pleased, against his own fellow-citizens and his own city.

Wherefore, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=ethnic long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Trallians</a> employ him as the relater of their indignation, and the keeper of their letters, and the witness of their injuries, and the utterer of their complaints, let them lower their high tone for the future, let them restrain their high spirit, let them bridle their arrogance, let them confess that the best representative of their city is to be found in the person of <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a>.

[54] The city was offended with him on account of the affair of <a href=/people/2602 target=_blank>Castricius</a>; concerning the whole of which <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> has made a sufficient reply. Very much against its will, it had paid <a href=/people/2602 target=_blank>Castricius</a> some money which had long been due to him. Hence comes all its hatred to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, and this is his whole offence. And when <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> had arrived in that city among a set of angry men, and had re-opened their indignation with respect to <a href=/people/2602 target=_blank>Castricius</a> by mentioning the subject, the chief men jumped up and left the place, and refused to be present in that assembly, and would not assist in carrying the decree, or in framing the deposition. And to such an extent was that assembly deprived of the presence of the nobles of the city, that <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a> was the chief of the chief men present; and it was by his tongue, acting like a sort of fan of sedition, that assembly of needy men was ventilated. [55] Therefore, now learn the justice of the grief and complaints of a city, a moderate city, as I have always considered it, and a worthy one, as the citizens themselves wish it to be thought. They complain that the money which was deposited amongst them, in the name of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>'s father, — money which had been collected from different cities, — has been taken away from them. At another time I will inquire of them what power <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> had in the matter. At present I only ask the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=ethnic long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Trallians</a>, whether they say the money, which they complain has been taken from them, was their own, — was a contribution from the other cities for their use. I wish to hear this. We do not say so, says he. What then? We say that it was brought to us — entrusted to us in the name of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, the father of this man, for the days of festival and the games which were to be celebrated in his honour. [56] What then? “This you had no right to touch.” Presently I will see to that; but first of all I will deal with this. A dignified, a wealthy, a noble city complains that it is not allowed to retain what does not belong to it. It says that it has been plundered, because it has not in its possession what never was its own. What can be said or imagined more shameless than this? A town was selected in which, above all others, the money contributed by all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> for the honours of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> should be deposited. All this money was transferred from the purpose of doing him honour, and employed in gainful traffic and usury. Many years afterwards it was recovered. </p>                        </div>

For we cannot reasonably complain of everything at which we are annoyed. “But it accuses him in the severest language.” Not the city, but ignorant men do so, who have been stirred up by <a href=/people/5099 target=_blank>Maeandrius</a>. And while on this topic I beg you over and over again to recollect how great is the rashness of a multitude, — how great the peculiar levity of Greeks, — and how great is the influence of a seditious speech in a public assembly. Even here, in this most dignified and well-regulated of cities, when the forum is full of courts of justice, full of magistrates, full of most excellent men and citizens, — when the senate-house, the chastiser of rashness, the directress in the path of duty, commands and surveys the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, still what storms do we see excited in the public assemblies?

[58] Do not, then, oppose to me the names of those noble cities, for those whom this family has scorned as enemies, it will never be afraid of as witnesses. But you must confess, if your cities are governed by the counsels of your chief men, that it was not by the rashness of the multitude, but by the deliberate counsel of the nobles, that war was undertaken by those cities against the Roman people; or if that disturbance was at that time caused by the rashness of the ignorant mob, then permit me to separate the errors of the Roman people from the general cause. </p>                        </div>

They called <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> a god, they called him their father and the preserver of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, they called him <a href=/people/3598 target=_blank>Evius</a>, Nysius, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a>. [61] It was the same time, when all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> shut its gates against Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, the consul, and not only received that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=demonym long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> into their cities, but even spontaneously invited him. Let us be allowed, if not to forget these things, at least to be silent respecting them. Let me be allowed rather to complain of the inconstancy of the Greeks than of their cruelty. Are these two men to have influence with a people which they wished utterly to destroy? For whomsoever they could they slew while in the garb of peace; as far as depended on them they annihilated the name of Roman citizens. </p>                        </div>

And this, forsooth, is the reason why this cause is pleaded near the steps of <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a>. It is on account of this charge, O <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, that this place and that mob has been selected by you. You know how numerous that crowd is, how great is its unanimity, and of what weight it is in the popular assemblies. I will speak in a low voice, just so as to let the judges hear me. For men are not wanting who would be glad to excite that people against me and against every eminent man; and I will not assist them and enable them to do so more easily. [67] As gold, under pretence of being given to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, was accustomed every year to be exported out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and all the provinces to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> issued an edict establishing a law that it should not be lawful for gold to be exported out of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. And who is there, O judges, who cannot honestly praise this measure? The senate had often decided, and when I was consul it came to a most solemn resolution that gold ought not to be exported. But to resist this barbarous superstition were an act of dignity, to despise the multitude of <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, which at times was most unruly in the assemblies in defence of the interests of the republic, was an act of the greatest wisdom. “But Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, after he had taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, though he was a conqueror, touched nothing which was in that temple.” [68] In the first place, he acted wisely, as he did in many other instances, in leaving no room for his detractors to say anything against him, in a city so prone to suspicion and to evil speaking. For I do not suppose that the religion of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, our enemies, was any obstacle to that most illustrious general, but that he was hindered by his own modesty. Where then is the guilt? Since you nowhere impute any theft to us, since you approve of the edict, and confess that it was passed in due form, and did not deny that the gold was openly sought for and produced the facts of the case themselves show that the business was executed by the instrumentality of men of the highest character. There was a hundredweight of gold, more or less openly seized at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>, and weighed out in the forum at the feet of the praetor, by <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/3151 target=_blank>Caesius</a>, a Roman knight, a most excellent and upright man; twenty pounds weight or a little more were seized at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, by Lucius <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a>, who is here in court, one of our judges; some was seized also at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395269Uadr class=place long=26.9346 lat=39.504>Adramyttium</a>, by Cnaeus <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, the lieutenant, and a small quantity at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamus</a>. [69] The amount of the gold is known; the gold is in the treasury; no theft is imputed to him; but it is attempted to render him unpopular. The speaker turns away from the judges, and addresses himself to the surrounding multitude. Each city, O <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, has its own peculiar religion we have ours. While <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was flourishing, and while the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were in a peaceful state, still the religious ceremonies and observances of that people were very much at variance with the splendour of this empire and the dignity of our name and the institutions of our ancestors. And they are the more odious to us now because that nation has shown by arms what were its feelings towards our supremacy. How dear it was to the immortal gods is proved by its having been defeated, by its revenues having been farmed out to our contractors, by its being reduced to a state of subjection. </p>                        </div>

[80] I only ask this; whether those farms can be bought and sold by the civil law; whether they come under the provisions of the civil law, whether or no they are freehold, whether they can be registered at the treasury and before the censor?

For <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> framed his complaint in this way, when he was speaking of the perfidy of Decianus: “He, who was my original informant; who communicated the facts of the case; whom I have followed, he has been bribed by <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, he has deserted and abandoned me.” Have you, then, been the prime mover in bringing that man into peril of all his; fortunes, whose counselor you had been, with whom you had preserved all the privileges of your rank, a most virtuous man, a man born of a most noble family, a man who had done great services to the republic? Forsooth, I will defend Decianus, who has become suspected by you through no fault of his own. [82] Believe me, he was not bribed; for what was there which could have been got by bribing him? Could he have contrived for the trial to last longer? Why, the law only allows six hours altogether. How much would Decianus rather have taken away from those six hours, if he had wished to serve you. In truth, that is what he himself suspects, — you envied the ingenuity of your junior counsel. Because he discharged the part which he had undertaken with wit, and examined the witnesses cleverly, 8<br /> ***But if this be probable, at all events it is not very probable that Decianus was bribed by <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>.

And do you accuse that man of avarice who you say was willing to abstain from taking two millions of sesterces? For when he was buying you, what was it that he was buying?

And in that I should be glad to know what you find fault with, — is it, that he asserted anything which was false? How do you prove it? “She was,” says he, “a person of good family.” O man, learned in the law! What? cannot inheritances legally come from women of good family? “She was,” says he, “under the power of her husband.” Now I understand you; but was she so by use or by purchase? It could not be by use for legitimate guardianship cannot be annulled except by the consent of all the guardians. By purchase? Then it must have been with the consent of all of them; and certainly you will not say that that of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> was obtained. [85] That alternative remains which he did not cease asserting loudly; “that <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> ought not, when he was praetor, to have attended to his own private concerns, or to have made any mention of the inheritance.” I hear, O Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, that very great inheritances came to you, to you who are about to decide as judge on the case of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, on account of your exceeding liberality and of the great services which you had done your friends, during the time that you were governing the province of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> with consular power. If any one had said that those inheritances belonged to him, would you have given them up? You, O Titus <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, if any inheritance in Africa comes to you, will you abandon it? or, will you retain it as your own, without being liable to the imputation of avarice, without any sacrifice of your dignity? “But the possession of the inheritance of which we are speaking was demanded in the name of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, when Globulus was praetor.” Well then, it was not any sudden violence, nor the idea of any favourable opportunity, nor force, nor any peculiarity of time, nor the possession of command and of the forces which induced <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> to commit this injury. <br /> [86] And, therefore, it is to this point that Marcus <a href=/people/7893 target=_blank>Lurco</a> also, a most excellent man, and a great friend of mine, has especially addressed the sting of his evidence. He said, that it was not becoming for a praetor in his province to claim money from a private individual. Why, I should like to know, O <a href=/people/7893 target=_blank>Lurco</a>, is it not becoming? It is not becoming to force or extort money, or to receive money contrary to the laws; but you will never convince me that it is not becoming to claim it, unless you can show that it is not lawful to do so. Is it right to accept of honorary lieutenancies for the sake of exacting what is one's due, as you yourselves have done lately, and as many good men have often done, (and I, indeed, find no fault with such conduct; I see that our allies complain of it;) and, do you think a praetor, if he, being in his province, does not abandon an inheritance which comes to him, is not only to be blamed but even to be condemned? </p>                        </div>

For he did not conceal, or think it at all necessary to be silent about the cause of his anger. He complained that his freedman had been condemned by <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> when he was praetor. O how miserable is the condition of those who have the government of provinces! in which diligence is sure to bring enmity; carelessness is sure to incur reproach; severity is dangerous; liberality meets only with ingratitude. The conversation addressed to one is insidious; the flattery with which one is courted is mischievous; the countenance which every one wears towards you is friendly; the disposition of numbers is hostile; dislikes are secret; caresses are open; they wait with eagerness for the coming praetors, they fawn on those who are present, they abandon and betray those who are departing.

If there was any violence employed in the business, any fraud, any fear, any trickery, still who compelled any arrangement to be made at all? who compelled the parties to have recourse to an arbitrator? What will you say, if all that money was restored to this young man by Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>? if it was claimed by him? if it was collected for him? and if this was done through the agency of this <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> who is here in court the freedman of this youth's father, and a man most highly esteemed by the elder <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>? Do we not then seem not only to escape from the charge of covetousness, but even to deserve the credit of very extraordinary liberality? For he gave up to the young man his relation the whole of their joint inheritance, which by law ought to have belonged to both of them in equal shares; and he himself touched none of Valeria's property.

He says that he gave fifty talents to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>. Let us hear the man himself. He is not here. How then does he say it? His mother produces one letter, and his sister produces a second; and they say that he had written to them to say that he had given this large sum to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>. Therefore he, whom, if he were to swear while holding by the altar, no one would believe, is to be allowed to prove whatever he pleases by a letter without being put on his oath at all! And what a man he is! how unfriendly to his fellow-citizens; a man who preferred squandering a sufficiently ample patrimony, which he might have spent among us here, in Grecian banquets!

What victim can you offer more acceptable to the manes of Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, — who intended, after you had been all murdered amid the embraces of your children and your wives, to bury you beneath the burning ruins of your country, — than you will offer, if you satiate his impious hatred towards all of us in the blood of Lucius <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>? [96] Let us then offer a sacrifice to <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, let us make atonement to <a href=/people/965 target=_blank>Cethegus</a>, let us recall the exiles, let us in our turn, if you, O judges, think fit, suffer the punishment due to too great piety, and to the greatest possible affection towards our country. At this moment we are being mentioned by name by the informers; accusations are being invented against us; dangers are being prepared for us. And if they did these things by the instrumentality of others, — if, in short, by using the name of the people, they had excited a mob of ignorant citizens, we could bear it with more equanimity. <br />But this can never be borne, that they should think that, by means of senators and knights of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who have done all these things with a view to the safety of all the citizens, by their common decision, animated with one idea, and inspired with one and the same virtue, the prime movers, and leaders, and chief actors in these transactions, can be deprived of all their fortunes, and be expelled from the city. In truth, they are acquainted with the feelings and inclinations of the Roman people; by every means which it is master of, the Roman people indicates what are its opinions and feelings; there is no diversity of opinion, or of inclination, or of language. [97] Wherefore, if any one summons me, I come. I not only do not object to the Roman people as arbitrators in my cause, but I even demand them. Let there be no violence; let weapons and stones be kept at a distance let the artisans depart; let the slaves be silent. No one who hears me will be so unjust, if he be only a free man and a citizen, as not to think that he ought rather to think of rewards for me than of punishment. </p>                        </div>

We who wrested fire and sword out of the hands of Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, are trusting now to the judgment of an ignorant multitude, and are in dread of the sentence of chosen men and most honourable citizens. [98] Our fathers by their decision delivered Marcus <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquillius</a>, who had been convicted of many charges of avarice, proved by abundant evidence, because he had behaved gallantly in the Servile war. I, when consul, lately defended Cnaeus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>; who, because he had been a gallant and fearless consul, was preserved to the republic uninjured. I, when consul, defended also Lucius <a href=/people/12001 target=_blank>Murena</a>, the consul elect. Not one of the judges in that case — though they were most eminent men who were the prosecutors — thought that they ought to entertain for one moment the accusation of bribery, because, while <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> was still waging war against the republic, they agreed with me that it was necessary for them to have two consuls on the first of January. <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/7138 target=_blank>Thermius</a>, an innocent and virtuous man, and one adorned with every sort of distinction, has been twice acquitted this year, when I have defended him. How great was the joy, how great were the congratulations of the Roman people at that event, for the sake of the republic! Wise and grave judges have always, when deciding in criminal trials, considered what the interests of the state, and the general safety, and the present necessities of the republic required. [99] When the voting tablets are given to you, O judges, it will not be <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> alone who will be interested in their verdict; the generals and all those who are leaders in the preservation of the city will all be interested; all good men will be interested; you yourselves will be interested; your children, your own lives, your country, the general safety, will all be interested in your vote. In this cause you are not determining about foreign nations, or about the allies; you are deciding on the welfare of your own selves and your own republic. </p>                        </div>
