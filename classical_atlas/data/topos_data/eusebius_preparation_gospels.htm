But first of all, it is well to define clearly what this word 'Gospel' means to express. It is this then that brings 'good tidings' to all men of the advent of the highest and greatest blessings, which having been long since foretold have recently shone forth on all mankind-a Gospel which makes not provision for undiscerning wealth, nor for this petty and much-suffering life, nor for anything belonging to the body and corruption, but for the blessings which are dear and congenial to souls possessing an intelligent nature, and on which the interests of their bodies also depend, and follow them like a shadow. </p>                        </div>

For some have supposed that Christianity has no reason to support it, but that those who desire the name confirm their opinion by an unreasoning faith and an assent without examination; and they assert that no one is able by clear demonstration to furnish evidence of the truth of the things promised, but that they require their converts to adhere to faith only, and therefore they are called 'the Faithful,' because of their uncritical and untested faith. With good reason therefore, in setting myself down to this treatise on the Demonstration of the Gospel, I think that I ought, as a preparation for the whole subject, to give brief explanations beforehand concerning the questions which may reasonably be put to us both by Greeks and by those of the Circumcision, and by every one who searches with exact inquiry into the opinions held among us. </p>                        </div>

'With regard then to the first origin of mankind two explanations have been held among the most accepted physiologists and historians. For some of them, on the supposition that the universe is uncreated and imperishable, declared that the human race also has existed from eternity, their procreation of children having never had a beginning; while others, who thought the world to be created and perishable, said that, like it, mankind were first created within definite periods of time. 'For, according to the original constitution of the universe, heaven and earth, they said, had one form, their nature being mixed: but afterwards, when their corporeal particles were separated from each other, though the cosmos embraced in itself the whole visible order, the air was subjected to continual motion. The fiery part of it gathered towards the highest regions, because fire is naturally borne upwards by reason of its lightness; and from this cause the sun and all the multitude of stars were caught and carried off in the general whirl: but the muddy and turbid part of the air, in its commixture with the moist parts, settled down together because of its heaviness, and by revolving in itself and continually contracting made the sea out of the moist parts, and out of the more solid parts made the earth, muddy and quite soft. <br />'This was at first hardened from the fire round the sun shining upon it, and afterwards, when the surface was thrown into fermentation through the warmth, some of the liquid particles swelled up in many places, and tumours were formed about them surrounded by thin membranes, a thing which may still be seen going on in stagnant pools and marshy places, when upon the cooling of the ground the air becomes suddenly fiery, because the change does not take place in it gradually. <br />'The moist parts then being quickened into life by the warmth in the way mentioned, during the nights they received their nourishment direct from the mist which falls from the surrounding atmosphere, and during the days became hardened by the heat; and at last, when the pregnant cells attained their full growth, and the membranes were thoroughly heated and burst asunder, all various types of living things sprang up. <br />'And those of them which had received the largest share of heat went off into the upper regions, and became birds; while those which retained an earthy consistency were counted in the order of reptiles and of the other land animals; and those which had partaken most largely of the watery element ran together to the place congenial to their nature, and were called aquatic. <br />'But the earth being more and more solidified both by the fire about the sun and by the winds, at last was no longer able to quicken any of the larger creatures into life, but the several kinds of animals were generated from their union one with another. <br />'It seems that even <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, who was a disciple of the physicist <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, does not dissent from what has been now said concerning the nature of the universe; for he thus writes in the <a href=/people/1684 target=_blank>Melanippe</a>: <br />So heaven and earth at first had all one form; <br />But when in place dissevered each from other, <br />They gave to all things birth, and brought to light <br />Trees, birds, and beasts, and all the salt sea's brood, <br />And race of mortal men. <br />'Such are the traditions which we have received concerning the first beginnings of the universe. And they say that the primitive generations of mankind, living in a disorderly and savage state, used to go wandering out over the pastures, and procure for food the tenderest herbage, and the fruits of trees that grew wild: and that when warred on by the wild beasts they were taught by their own interest to help one another, and from gathering together through fear they gradually recognized each other's forms. <br />'And though their speech was originally indistinct and confused, by degrees they articulated their words, and settling with each other signs for every object lying before them, they made their interpretation of all things intelligible among themselves. <br />'But when such associations came to be formed throughout all the inhabited world, they had not all a language of the same sounds, because they each arranged their words as it chanced; and from this cause there were originally all kinds of languages, and the associations first formed became the progenitors of all the nations. <br />'So then the first generations of men, by whom none of the conveniences of life had been discovered, passed a hard time, being destitute of clothing, and unused to houses and fire, and altogether without any idea of prepared food. For not knowing even how to harvest their food that grew wild, they did not lay by any store of the fruits for their needs: and therefore in the winters many of them perished of the cold and scarcity of food. <br />'But afterwards, being gradually taught by experience, they took refuge in their caves in the winter, and laid by such fruits as could be kept. And when fire became known, the usefulness of other things was gradually discovered and the arts also were invented, and all other things that could benefit their common life. <br />'For necessity itself became universally men's teacher in all things, naturally suggesting the knowledge of each to a being well endowed by nature, and having for all purposes the help of hands, and speech, and ready wit. So concerning the origin of mankind and the most primitive mode of life we will be content with what has been said, making brevity our aim.' </p>                        </div>

He declared that decay and, long before that, generation originated in the revolution of all these worlds from infinite ages. The earth, he says, is in figure cylindrical, and its depth a third part of its breadth. He says too that the eternal generative force of heat and cold was separated at the generation of this world, and that from it a kind of sphere of flame grew round the atmosphere of the earth as bark round a tree; and that when this flame was rent asunder and shut off into certain orbits, the sun and moon and stars came into existence. Further, he says that man at first was generated from animals of other kinds, because while the other animals quickly find food of themselves, man alone needs to be nursed for a long time; and for this reason, being such as he is, he could not in the beginning have been kept alive. These then are the opinions of <a href=/people/1151 target=_blank>Anaximander</a>. <br />'But <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a>, it is said, declared the air to be the first element of the universe, and that this is in its generic nature infinite, but is differentiated by the qualities attached to it, and that all things are generated by virtue of a certain condensation and subsequent rarefaction of this air. Its motion however subsists eternally, and when the air was compressed, first, he said, the earth was produced, and was very broad, and therefore according to reason floated upon the air; and the sun, and moon, and other heavenly bodies were originally produced out of earth. He declares, for instance, that the sun is earth, but because of its swift motion it has a great supply of heat. <br />'<a href=/people/671 target=_blank>Xenophanes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> has proceeded by a way of his own, diverging from all who have been previously mentioned, for he leaves neither generation nor decay, but says that the All is always alike. For, says he, if it were to begin to be, it must previously not be; but Non-being cannot begin to be, nor can Non-being make anything, nor from Non-being can anything begin to be. <br />'He declares also that the senses are fallacious, and with them altogether disparages even reason itself. Also he declares that the earth being continuously carried down little by little in time passes away into the sea. He says also that the sun is formed from a gathering of many small sparks. With regard to the gods; also he declares that there is no ruling power among them; for it is not right that any of the gods should be under a master: and none of them needs anything at all from any; and that they hear and see universally and not partially. <br />'Also he declares that the earth is infinite, and not surrounded; by air on every side; and that all things are produced out of earth: the sun, however, and the other heavenly bodies he says 'are produced out of the clouds. <br />'But <a href=/people/581 target=_blank>Parmenides</a> the Eleatic, the companion of <a href=/people/671 target=_blank>Xenophanes</a>, both claimed to hold his opinions and at the same time tried to establish the opposite position.

He says too that if anything subsists besides Being, this is Non-being, and Non-being does not exist in the universe. Thus he concludes that Being is uncreated. The earth, he says, has arisen from the dense air having settled down. <br />'<a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> the Eleatic put forth nothing properly his own, but discussed these opinions more at large. <br />'<a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=person long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> supposed that the All is infinite, because there was none who could possibly have framed it: he further says that it is unchangeable; and generally, everything being such as it is, he expressly asserts that the causes of the processes now going on have no beginning, but all things absolutely, past, present, and to come, are wholly fixed beforehand by necessity from infinite time. Of the generation of the sun and moon he says, that they moved in their separate courses, when as yet they had no natural heat at all, nor generally any brightness, but on the contrary were assimilated to the nature of the earth; for each of them had been produced earlier when the world was as yet in some peculiar rudimentary condition, and afterwards, when the orbit round the sun became enlarged, the fire was included in it. <br />'<a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> son of <a href=/people/1269 target=_blank>Neocles</a>, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, endeavours to suppress the vain conceit about gods: but also says that nothing is produced out of Non-being, because the All always was and always will be such as it is; that nothing new is brought to pass in the All because of the infinite time which has already passed; that all is body, and not only unchangeable, but also infinite; that the summum bonum is pleasure. <br />'<a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> of Gyrene says that pleasure is the summum bonum, and pain the worst of evils; but all other physiology he excludes by saying that the only useful thing is to inquire <br />What for your home is evil and what good. <br />'<a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=person long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Agrigentum</a> made four elements, fire, water, air, and earth, and their cause friendship and enmity. There was first the mixture of the elements, out of which, he says, the air was separated and diffused all around; and next to the air the fire leaped out, and having no other place was driven upwards by the freezing of the air. And there are two hemispheres, he says, moving in a circle round the earth, the one wholly of fire, the other of air and a little fire mixed, which he supposes to be night; and the beginning of their motion resulted from its having happened when the fire predominated in the combination. And the sun is in its nature not fire, but a reflexion of fire, like the reflexion formed from water. The moon, he says, was formed separately by itself out of the air left by the fire; for this air froze just like hail: but its light it has from the sun. The ruling power, he says, is neither in the head nor in the breast, but in the blood; whence also he thinks that in whatever part of the body this ruling power (the blood) is more largely diffused, in that part men excel. <br />'<a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> says that the All is eternal, because if it were created it would have come from Non-being; and infinite, because eternal, for it had no first principle to start from, nor any limit, nor end. But neither does the All partake of motion; for it cannot be moved without changing its place; and a change of place must of necessity be either into plenum or into vacuum. The air being condensed makes clouds, then water, which also flowing down upon the sun extinguishes it: and it is rekindled again by evaporation. And in time the sun is made solid by the dryness, and forms stars out of the clear water, and from being extinguished and rekindled makes night and day, and eclipses generally. <br />'<a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424277PApo class=person long=27.693 lat=42.421>Apollonia</a> supposes that air is the primary element, that all things are in motion, and that the worlds are infinite. His cosmogony is as follows: when the All was in motion, and was becoming in one part rare and in another dense, where the dense part happened to meet it formed a concretion, and so the other parts on the same principle; and the lightest having taken the highest position produced the sun.' </p>                        </div>

And is the blood that by which we think, or the air, or the fire? Or is it none of these, but is the brain that which supplies the sensation of sight, and hearing, and smell? And from these might come memory and opinion, and from memory and opinion, when they have reached a settled state, in the same manner knowledge arises.

And he was also called <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/4201 target=_blank>Meilichios</a>. And some say that his brothers invented walls of brick. Afterwards there sprang from their race two youths, one of whom was called Technites (Artificer), and the other Geinos Autochthon (<a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>-born Aboriginal). These devised the mixing of straw with the clay of bricks, and drying them in the sun, and moreover invented roofs.

And he has a sister born of the aforesaid parents, who was called <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a> (earth), and from her, he says, because of her beauty, they called the earth by the same name. And their father, the Most High, died in an encounter with wild beasts, and was deified, and his children offered to him libations and sacrifices. <br />'And <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, having succeeded to his father's rule, takes to himself in marriage his sister <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a>, and gets by her four sons, <a href=/people/6450 target=_blank>Elus</a> who is also <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, and <a href=/people/8953 target=_blank>Baetylus</a>, and <a href=/people/4134 target=_blank>Dagon</a> who is Siton, and <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>. Also by other wives <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> begat a numerous progeny; on which account <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a> was angry, and from jealousy began to reproach <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, so that they even separated from each other. <br />'But <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, after he had left her, used to come upon her with violence, whenever he chose, and consort with her, and go away again; he used to try also to destroy his children by her; but <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a> repelled him many times, having gathered to herself allies. And when <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> had advanced to manhood, he, with the counsel and help of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> <a href=/people/11025 target=_blank>Trismegistus</a> (who was his secretary), repels his father <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, and avenges his mother. <br />'To <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> are born children, <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>.

Then <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> talked magical words to the allies of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, and inspired them with a desire of fighting against <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> on behalf of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Ge</a>. And thus <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> engaged in war, and drove <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> from his government, and succeeded to the kingdom. Also there was taken in the battle the beloved concubine of <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, being great with child, whom <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> gave in marriage to <a href=/people/4134 target=_blank>Dagon</a>. And in his house she gave birth to the child begotten of <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, which she named <a href=/people/4970 target=_blank>Demarus</a>. <br />' After this <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> builds a wall round his own dwelling, and founds the first city, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/341356PByb class=place long=35.646 lat=34.119>Byblos</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. <br />'Soon after this he became suspicious of his own brother <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, and, with the advice of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, threw him into a deep pit and buried him. At about this time the descendants of the <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a> put together rafts and ships, and made voyages; and, being cast ashore near Mount <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, consecrated a temple there. And the allies of <a href=/people/6450 target=_blank>Elus</a>, who is <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, were surnamed Eloim, as these same, who were surnamed after <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, would have been called Kronii. <br />'And <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, having a son Sadidus, dispatched him with his own sword, because he regarded him with suspicion, and deprived him of life, thus becoming the murderer of his son. In like manner he cut off the head of a daughter of his own; so that all the gods were dismayed at the disposition of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>. <br />'But as time went on <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a>, being in banishment, secretly sends his maiden daughter <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a> with two others her sisters, Rhea and <a href=/people/1417 target=_blank>Dione</a>, to slay <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> by craft. But <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> caught them, and though they were his sisters, made them his wedded wives. And when <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> knew it, he sent Eimarmene and Hora with other allies on an expedition against <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>. and these <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> won over to his side and kept with him. <br />'Further, he says, the god <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> devised the Baetylia, having contrived to put life into stones. And to <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> there were born of <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a> seven daughters, <a href=/people/8437 target=_blank>Titanides</a> or Artemides: and again to the same there were born of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a> seven sons, of whom the youngest was deified at his birth; and of <a href=/people/1417 target=_blank>Dione</a> females, and of <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a> again two males, <a href=/people/1185 target=_blank>Desire</a> and <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>. And <a href=/people/4134 target=_blank>Dagon</a>, after he discovered corn and the plough, was called <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Arotrios. <br />'And one of the <a href=/people/8437 target=_blank>Titanides</a> united to <a href=/people/6961 target=_blank>Suduc</a>, who is named the Just, gives birth to <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>. <br />'In Peraea also there were born to <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> three sons, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> of the same name with his father, and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. In their time are born <a href=/people/1686 target=_blank>Pontus</a>, and <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, and <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> father of <a href=/people/1686 target=_blank>Pontus</a> and son of <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>. <br />'And from <a href=/people/1686 target=_blank>Pontus</a> is born Sidon (who from the exceeding sweetness of her voice was the first to invent musical song) and <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>.

In consequence of which it also exerts an unsurpassable swiftness by means of its breath, without feet and hands or any other of the external members by which the other animals make their movements. It also exhibits forms of various shapes, and in its progress makes spiral leaps as swift as it chooses. It is also most long-lived, and its nature is to put off its old skin, and so not only to grow young again, but also to assume a larger growth; and after it has fulfilled its appointed measure of age, it is self-consumed, in like manner as <a href=/people/4312 target=_blank>Tauthus</a> himself has set down in his sacred books: for which reason this animal has also been adopted in temples and in mystic rites. <br />'We have spoken more fully about it in the memoirs entitled Ethothiae, in which we prove that it is immortal, and is self-consumed, as is stated before: for this animal does not die by a natural death, but only if struck by a violent blow. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> call it Good Daemon: in like manner the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> also surname it <a href=/people/7526 target=_blank>Cneph</a>; and they add to it the head of a hawk because of the hawk's activity. <br />'<a href=/people/9323 target=_blank>Epeis</a> also (who is called among them a chief hierophant and sacred scribe, and whose work was translated [into Greek] by <a href=/people/2693 target=_blank>Areius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/290309UHer class=person long=30.9344 lat=29.0855>Heracleopolis</a>), speaks in an allegory word for word as follows: <br />'The first and most divine being is a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> with the form of a hawk, extremely graceful, which whenever he opened his eyes filled all with light in his original birthplace, but if he shut his eyes, darkness came on.' <br />'<a href=/people/9323 target=_blank>Epeis</a> here intimates that he is also of a fiery substance, by saying he shone through, for to shine through is peculiar to light.

And from these last grew the flourishing family of the <a href=/people/1941 target=_blank>Eumolpidae</a>, and that of the Heralds, the Hierophants I suppose, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <br />'And then <a href=/people/3781 target=_blank>Baubo</a> — for I shall not shrink from telling it — having received <a href=/people/967 target=_blank>Deo</a> hospitably, offers her a draught. And when she refused to take it, and would not drink — for she was full of sorrow — <a href=/people/3781 target=_blank>Baubo</a> became much annoyed as being forsooth disdained, and exposed herself to the goddess: and <a href=/people/967 target=_blank>Deo</a>, pleased at the sight, at last reluctantly accepted the draught, because she was delighted at what she saw. <br />'These are the secret mysteries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>! These are the things which <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> records! But I will set before you the very words of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, that you may have the master of mysteries himself as witness of their shamelessness: <br />She spake, and quick her flowing robes withdrawn <br />Showed all the secret beauty of her form. <br />The child <a href=/people/1669 target=_blank>Iacchus</a>, laughing, stretched his hand <br />To touch her tender breasts, and <a href=/people/3781 target=_blank>Baubo</a> smil'd; <br />Then, too, the goddess smil'd with cheerful thought, <br />And took the shining bowl which held the draught. <br />'There is also the watchword of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=demonym long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian</a> mysteries: I fasted, I drank the draught, I took from the chest, finished the work and put it back into the basket, and from the basket into the chest. Noble indeed the sights, and becoming to a goddess! <br />'Worthy rather are these mysteries of night, and of torch-light, and of the great-hearted, or rather weak-minded, people of the <a href=/people/2227 target=_blank>Erechtheidae</a>, and of the other Greeks also, men for whom there remain after death things that they little look for, <br />'To whom then does <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesian</a> address this foreboding? To night-walkers, sorcerers, bacchanals male and female, to the initiated. These he threatens with what follows death; to these he predicts the fire. For they receive an unholy initiation in what men regard as mysteries. <br />'Custom therefore, and vain opinion, and the mysteries of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> are a kind of fraud devoutly observed by men who, with spurious piety, promote their abominable initiations and profane orgiastic rites. <br />'What also are those mystic chests? For I must lay bare their holy things, and tell out their forbidden secrets. Are they not sesame-cakes, and pyramids, and balls, and flat cakes full of knobs, and lumps of salt? A <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> also, mystic symbol of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> Bassarus? <br />'And besides these are there not pomegranates, and shoots of fig-trees, and reeds, and ivies, and round cakes also, and poppies? <br />'These are their holy things! And there are in addition the secret symbols of <a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a>, wild marjoram, a lamp, a sword, a woman's comb, which is an euphemistic and mystical name. <br />'O barefaced shamelessness! In times of old for modest men pleasure was veiled in night, and night in silence: but now the night that is sacred to wantonness is the talk of those who are to be initiated, and the fire exposes their lewd passions by the light of torches. <br />'Quench thou the fire, O Hierophant! Blush for thy lights, O bearer of the torch! That flame exposes thine <a href=/people/1669 target=_blank>Iacchus</a>. Suffer the night to conceal the mysteries: let darkness pay respect to your dignified orgies. The fire is no hypocrite: its duty is to expose and to punish. <br />'These are the atheists' mysteries. And atheists I rightly call them, since they have not known Him who is truly God, but worship a child torn in pieces by <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>, and a poor wailing woman; and things for very shame unmentionable they shamelessly worship, and so are involved in a twofold atheism: the first, in that they are ignorant of God, not acknowledging Him who is God indeed; and the other and second delusion this, that they regard those which are not as though they were, and call them gods who have no true being, or rather no being at all, but have only received the name.'

But the traditional fables concerning them, in which there are any slanders or accusations against them, he considered to be wicked and unprofitable and unseemly, and unworthy not to say of gods but even of good men, and he excluded them all, and trained men both to speak and think all that was excellent concerning the gods, imputing to them no practice unworthy of their blessed nature. <br />'For among the Romans there is neither any story of <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> being mutilated by his own children, nor of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> devouring his own offspring through fear of their attack, nor of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> overthrowing the dynasty of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, and shutting up his own father in the prison of <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>; nor yet of wars, and wounds, and bonds, and servitudes of gods among men. <br />'Nor is any black-robed or mournful festival held among them, with women's wailings and lamentations over gods that vanished from sight, such as are celebrated among the Greeks in reference to the rape of <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>, and the sufferings of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, and all other things of a like kind. <br />'Nor would any one see among them, even though their customs are now corrupted, any wild enthusiasms, nor Corybantic frenzies, nor Bacchanalian revels and secret initiations, no all-night vigils of men and women together in the temples of the gods, nor any other of the monstrosities akin to these, but all things concerning the gods practised and spoken of with reverence, such as is seen neither among Greeks nor barbarians. <br />'And what I have admired most of all, though countless races have come to settle in the city, who were strictly bound to worship their ancestral gods with the rites of their own country, the city has never by public consent sought to imitate any of the foreign customs, a propensity which has occurred to many states ere now: but even if any sacred rites have been introduced in accordance with oracles, the city adapted them to its own institutions, and cast out all mythical quackery, as for example the rites of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=demonym long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Idaean</a> goddess. <br />'For in her honour the Consuls celebrate sacrifices and games every year according to the laws of the Romans: and her priests are a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> man and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> woman, and these go about the city begging for the goddess, as their custom is, with images fastened round their breasts, and rattling cymbals and accompanied by their followers playing on flutes the music of the Mother. <br />'But of the home-born Romans none proceeds through the city either so begging, or accompanied by flutes and dressed in an embroidered robe, nor celebrates the goddess with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> orgies by any law or decree of the Senate. <br />'So cautious is the attitude of the state towards foreign customs concerning the gods, shunning as ill-omened all vain display in which there is anything unbecoming. <br />'But let no one suppose me to be ignorant that some of the Grecian legends are useful to mankind; some exhibiting the works of nature allegorically, and others composed for the sake of consoling human misfortunes, and others removing troubles and terrors of the soul and overthrowing unsound opinions, and others invented for the sake of some other utility. <br />'But although I know these things as well as anybody, I am nevertheless cautiously disposed towards them, and I prefer to accept the theology of the Romans, considering that the benefits derived from the Hellenic legends are small, and not capable of benefiting many, but only those who have searched out the purposes for which they are made. And those who have taken part in this branch of philosophy are rare; while the great mass unversed in philosophy loves to take the tales concerning the gods in the worse senses, and is affected in one of two ways; either it despises the gods as tossed about in great misery, or else it abstains from none of the most disgraceful and lawless doings, seeing that they are attributed to the gods. <br />'On these subjects, however, let inquiry be left to those who study merely the theoretical part of philosophy: but of the polity established by <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> I thought these points worth recording.' </p>                        </div>

This is evident in the Orphic poems, and in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> stories: 'out the mind of the ancients is most clearly exhibited in the orgiastic rites connected with the initiations, and in what is symbolically acted in the religious services. <br />'For instance, not to digress far from our present subjects, they do not suppose nor admit any intercourse between <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>; and they guard against combining their worship; and their priestesses at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, they say, do not speak to each other when they meet, nor is ivy ever brought into the precincts of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, not because of their fabulous and nonsensical jealousies, but because the goddess presides over marriage and bridal processions, and drunkenness is unbecoming to bridegrooms, and most unbefitting to a marriage feast, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says: for the drinking of strong wine causes disorder both in body and soul, whereby what is sown and conceived being shapeless and misplaced does not take root well. Again, those who sacrifice to <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> do not consecrate the gall, but bury it beside the altar, meaning that the wedded life of wife and husband ought to be free from anger and wrath, and undisturbed by rage and bitterness. <br />'This symbolical style is more common in the tales and legends. As for instance, they relate that <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, being brought up in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a>. was stolen away while yet a virgin by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and was carried across and hidden in this region, where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a> afforded them a shady recess, nature's own bridal-chamber. And when <a href=/people/2126 target=_blank>Macris</a> — she was <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s nurse — came to seek her, and wished to make a search, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a> would not let her pry about, or approach the spot, on pretence that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> was there resting and passing the time in company with <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>. And as <a href=/people/2126 target=_blank>Macris</a> went away, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> thus escaped discovery on that occasion, and afterwards calling to mind her debt of gratitude to <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> she adopted her as partner in a common altar and common temple, so that sacrifices are first offered to <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> Μυχία, that is, 'of the inner shrine'; but some call her Νυχία, 'goddess of night.' In each of the names, however, there is the signification of secrecy and escape. Some say that <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> had secret intercourse there with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and, being undiscovered, was thus herself denominated <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> of the night: but when her marriage became openly known, and their intercourse first here in the neighbourhood of Citliaeron and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataea</a> had been revealed, she was called <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> Τελεία and Γαμήλιος, goddess of the perfect life, and of marriage. <br />'Those who understand the fable in a more physical and becoming sense connect <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> with <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> in the following way. <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, as has been said, is the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, and <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> is night, being a sort of oblivion on the part of those who turn to sleep. And night is nothing else but the shadow of the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. For when the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> has reached the West and been hidden by the shadow, this spreads itself out and darkens the air: and this is the cause of the failure of the full moon in an eclipse, when the shadow of the earth touches the moon in her orbit and obscures her light. Moreover, that <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> is none other than <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, you may learn from what follows. <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> we of course call the daughter of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a>, but we also name the same goddess <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a>: <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> therefore and <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> are two names of one goddess. <br />'Again of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> is born <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, and they both have the same power: and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> is so called as helping (ἀρήγων) in the mischances of violence and battle, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> as delivering and releasing (ἀπαλλάττων καὶ ἀπολύων) a man from his bodily diseases. For which reason also of the most fiery and blazing luminaries one, the sun, is named <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and the other of a fiery red is surnamed <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>. And it is not unsuitable that the same goddess (<a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>) is called the goddess of marriage, and considered to be the mother of <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a> and of the sun. For the end of marriage is birth; and birth is the passing out of darkness into the sun and light. And it is a fine saying of the poet: <br />'But soon her child, by <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a>'s aid, <br />Was brought to light, and saw the sun's bright rays.' </p>                        </div>

The same goddess therefore made also the marriage union, in order that she might prepare the way for birth. <br />'But perhaps we ought also to mention the more silly legend. For it is said that when <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> was at variance with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and was no longer willing to consort with him, but hid herself, he was wandering about in perplexity and fell in with <a href=/people/8750 target=_blank>Alalcomenes</a> the earth-born, and was taught by him that, to deceive <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, he must pretend to wed another wife. So <a href=/people/8750 target=_blank>Alalcomenes</a> helped him, and they secretly cut down a tall and beautiful oak, and shaped it and dressed it in bridal array, and called it Daedale: then the hymeneal was duly chanted, and the nymphs of <a href=/people/664 target=_blank>Triton</a> brought lustral water, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> supplied flutes and festal processions. But when these performances went on, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> could bear it no longer, but came down from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233LCit class=place long=23.2506 lat=38.185>Cithaeron</a>, followed by the women of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataea</a>, and from anger and jealousy came running up to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and when the counterfeit became manifest, she was reconciled to him and with joy and laughter herself led the bridal procession, and gave additional honour to the statue, and called the festival <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368290UDai class=place long=28.9763 lat=36.7522>Daedala</a>, and nevertheless from jealousy burnt the thing, lifeless though it was. <br />'Such then is the legend: and the explanation of it is as follows. The variance and quarrel of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is nothing else than the distemper and confusion of the elements, when they no longer bear a due proportion to each other in the cosmos, but disproportion and roughness arise, and they have a desperate fight and dissolve their connexion, and work the ruin of the universe. </p>                        </div>

These deities, they say, contribute most to the quickening of all things with life, <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> making the chief contribution of fire and wind, and <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> of water and earth, and both alike of air; and by these all things are generated and nourished. And for this reason, they say, the whole body of universal nature is made up completely out of the sun and moon, and as to the live parts of these before mentioned, breath, fire, earth, water, and finally air — just as in a man we count up head, and hands, and feet, and the other members — in the same manner the body of the cosmos is all composed of the parts before mentioned. <br />'Each of these, they say, was regarded as a god, and a special name given to each according to his proper character, by those of the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> who first made use of articulate speech. So they called the wind <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the word being so interpreted, and as he was the author of the soul in living beings they supposed him to be, as it were, a father of all. <br />'And with this, they say, the most illustrious poet of the Greeks agrees, when he speaks of this god, as <br />'Father of men and gods.' <br />'Fire by interpretation they called <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, considering him to be a great god, and to contribute much to the production and perfect growth of all things. The earth they supposed to be a sort of vessel containing all natural productions, and called it Mother: and the Greeks in like manner call it <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, the word having been a little changed through lapse of time. <br />'For of old she was called Γῆ μήτηρ (<a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> Mother), as <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> bears witness, saying — <br />'<a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> Mother of all, <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, giver of wealth.' <br />'The water, it is said, was called by the ancients <a href=/people/8041 target=_blank>Oceane</a>, which being interpreted is 'Mother of food,' but among some of the Greeks it was supposed to be the Ocean, concerning which the poet says, <br />'<a href=/people/527 target=_blank>Oceanus</a> sire, and <a href=/people/832 target=_blank>Tethys</a> mother of gods.' <br />'For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> consider their river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> to be the Ocean, and that the gods had their origin near it, because in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> alone of the whole world there are many cities founded by the elder gods, such as those of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a>, and many others. <br />'The air, it is said, they called <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, the word being so interpreted, and they regarded her as the daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and supposed her to be a virgin, because the air is naturally incorruptible, and occupies the highest place of the whole cosmos: on which account the fable went that she sprang from the head of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. She was called also <a href=/people/1857 target=_blank>Tritogeneia</a> from changing her nature thrice in the year, in spring, summer, and winter. She is also called <a href=/people/6507 target=_blank>Glaucopis</a>, not as some of the Greeks supposed because she had light-blue eyes, for this is silly, but because the air has a bluish appearance. <br />'They say that the five gods before mentioned travel over the whole world, and appear to men in the forms of sacred animals, sometimes also transforming themselves into the likenesses of men or other things: and that this is not fabulous, but possible, since these are in truth the progenitors of all things. The poet too, they say, having landed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and had tales of this kind imparted to him by the priests, in a certain passage of his poem stated the above-mentioned circumstance as actually occurring: <br />'They, curious oft of mortal actions, deign <br />In forms like these to round the earth and main, <br />Just and unjust recording in their mind, <br />And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind.' <br />'Thus much then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> say concerning the gods who are in heaven, and have had an eternal generation. <br />'But others, they say, were born of these on earth, who having been originally mortal have obtained immortality on account of their wisdom and general beneficence to mankind, and some of them have been kings in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Of these some have the same names, when interpreted, as the gods of heaven, but others have received a name of their own; as <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>, and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, and <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>, and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> also, whom some call <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a>; and in addition to these <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, and <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Hestia</a>, and <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> last: and <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a> was the first king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, having the same name as the luminary in the heaven.' </p>                        </div>

For such were the august deities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> according to the description of the writer before mentioned, who again, in the work which he entitled On Abstinence from Animal Food, gives such details as the following concerning the same people: <br />'Starting from this discipline and intimacy with the deity, they judged that the divine pervaded not man only, nor did soul tabernacle upon earth in man alone, but all animals were pervaded by almost the same kind of soul. Wherefore they admitted every animal into their manufacture of gods, and mixed up beasts and men just alike, and also the bodies of birds and men. <br />'For with them there is a figure represented like a man up to the neck, but having the face of a bird or a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> or some other animal: and, on the other hand again, the head of a man and members of some other animals, set partly below, and partly above. And hereby they indicate that according to the mind of the gods these animals also are associated one with another, and that it is not without a divine purpose that the wild beasts are bred up with us and tamed. <br />'Hence also the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> is worshipped as a god, and a division of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> which they call a Nome has from the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> the name Leonto-polites, and another, from the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>, Busirites, and another, from the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, Cynopolites. For the power which is over all they worshipped through the associated animals which each of the gods had given them. <br />'Water and fire, the most beautiful of the elements, they reverence as being chief causes of our preservation, and exhibit them also in their temples; as, I believe, even now at the opening of the sanctuary of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> the worship is performed by means of fire and water, the precentor pouring out the water and exhibiting the fire, whenever he stands upon the threshold and wakes the god in the native language of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. <br />'They reverence, therefore, these elements that bear a part in the sacrifices, and above these they reverence most highly the things which are more fully associated with the sacrifices: and such are all living beings, for in the village <a href=/people/8805 target=_blank>Anabis</a> they even worship a man, and sacrifice is there offered to him, and the victims are consumed by fire upon the altars: and yet presently he would eat the proper things prepared for him as a man. As, therefore, we ought to abstain from eating man's flesh, so we should abstain from the flesh of other animals. <br />'But further out of their abundant wisdom and their familiarity with the divine, they perceived that certain animals were more dear than men to certain of their gods, a hawk, for instance, to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, as having its whole nature made up of blood and breath, and feding pity even for man, and shrieking over an exposed corpse, and scraping up earth over it.' </p>                        </div>

The authors of the Orphic hymns supposed <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to be the mind of the world, and that he created all things therein, containing the world in himself. Therefore in their theological systems they have handed down their opinions concerning him thus: <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> was the first, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> last, the lightning's lord, <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> head, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> centre, all things are from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> born a male, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> virgin undefiled; <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the firm base of earth and starry heaven; <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> sovereign, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> alone first cause of all: <br />One power divine, great ruler of the world, <br />One kingly form, encircling all things here, <br />Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day; <br /><a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, first parent, and delightful <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>: <br />For in <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>' mighty body these all lie. <br />His head and beauteous face the radiant heaven <br />Reveals, and round him float in shining waves <br />The golden tresses of the twinkling stars. <br />On either side <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>' horns of gold are seen, <br />Sunrise and sunset, footpaths of the gods. <br />His eyes the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, the Moon's responsive light; <br />His mind immortal ether, sovereign truth, <br />Hears and considers all; nor any speech, <br />Nor cry, nor noise, nor ominous voice escapes <br />The ear of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, great <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>' mightier son: <br />Such his immortal head, and such his thought. <br />His radiant body, boundless, undisturbed <br />In strength of mighty limbs was formed thus: <br />The god's broad-spreading shoulders, breast, and back <br />Air's wide expanse displays; on either side <br />Grow wings, wherewith throughout all space he flies. <br /><a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> the all-mother, with her lofty hills, <br />His sacred belly forms; the swelling flood <br />Of hoarse resounding Ocean girds his waist. <br />His feet the deeply rooted ground upholds, <br />And dismal <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>, and earth's utmost bounds. <br />All things he hides, then from his heart again <br />In godlike action brings to gladsome light. <br />'<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, therefore, is the whole world, animal of animals, and god of gods; but <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, that is, inasmuch as he is the mind from which he brings forth all things, and by his thoughts creates them. When the theologians had explained the nature of god in this manner, to make an image such as their description indicated was neither possible, nor, if any one thought of it, could he show the look of life, and intelligence, and forethought by the figure of a sphere. <br />'But they have made the representation of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> in human form, because mind was that according to which he wrought, and by generative laws brought all things to completion; and he is seated, as indicating the steadfastness of his power: and his upper parts are bare, because he is manifested in the intellectual and the heavenly parts of the world; but his feet are clothed, because he is invisible in the things that lie hidden below. And he holds his sceptre in his left hand, because most close to that side of the body dwells the heart, the most commanding and intelligent organ: for the creative mind is the sovereign of the world. And in his right hand he holds forth either an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, because he is master of the gods who traverse the air, as the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> is master of the birds that fly aloft — or a victory, because he is himself victorious over all things.' </p>                        </div>

But of the whole, the drinking-water produced is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383211WAch class=place long=21.1067 lat=38.3388>Achelous</a>; and the sea-water <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>; while again that which makes the sea, inasmuch as it is productive, is <a href=/people/1147 target=_blank>Amphitrite</a>. Of the sweet waters the particular powers are called <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, and those of the sea-waters <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>. <br />'Again, the power of fire they called <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, and have made his image in the form of a man, but put on it a blue cap as a symbol of the revolution of the heavens, because the archetypal and purest form of lire is there. But the fire brought down from heaven to earth is less intense, and wants the strengthening and support which is found in matter: wherefore he is lame, as needing matter to support him. <br />'Also they supposed a power of this kind to belong to the sun and called it <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, from the pulsation (πάλσις) of his beams. There are also nine <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> singing to his lyre, which are the sublunar sphere, and seven spheres of the planets, and one of the fixed stars. And they crowned him with laurel, partly because the plant is full of fire, and therefore hated by daemons; and partly because it crackles in burning, to represent the god's prophetic art. <br />'But inasmuch as the sun wards off the evils of the earth, they called him <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> (Ἑρακλῆς), from his clashing against the air (κλᾶσθαι πρὸς τὸν ἀέρα) in passing from east to west. And they invented fables of his performing twelve labours, as the symbol of the division of the signs of the zodiac in heaven; and they arrayed him with a club and a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s skin, the one as an indication of his uneven motion, and the other representative of his strength in <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> the sign of the zodiac. <br />'Of the sun's healing power <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> is the symbol, and to him they have given the staff as a sign of the support and rest of the sick, and the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> is wound round it, as significant of his preservation of body and soul: for the animal is most full of spirit, and shuffles off the weakness of the body. It seems also to have a great faculty for healing: for it found the remedy for giving clear sight, and is said in a legend to know a certain plant which restores life. <br />'But the fiery power of his revolving and circling motion, whereby he ripens the crops, is called <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, not in the same sense as the power which produces the juicy fruits, but either from the sun's rotation (δινεῖν), or from his completing (διανύειν) his orbit in the heaven. And whereas he revolves round the cosmical seasons (Spas), and is the maker of times and tides, the sun is on this account called <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a>. <br />'Of his power over agriculture, whereon depend the gifts of wealth (<a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a>), the symbol is <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a>. He has, however, equally the power of destroying, on which account they make <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Sarapis</a> share the temple of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a>: and the purple tunic they make the symbol of the light that has sunk beneath the earth, and the sceptre broken at the top that of his power below, and the posture of the hand the symbol of his departure into the unseen world. <br />'<a href=/people/752 target=_blank>Cerberus</a> is represented with three heads, because the positions of the sun above the earth are three — rising, midday, and setting. <br />'The moon, conceived according to her brightness, they called <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, as it were ἀερότεμις, cutting the air. And <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, though herself a virgin, presides over childbirth, because the power of the new moon is helpful to parturition. <br />'What <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> is to the sun, that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> is to the moon: for the moon is a symbol of wisdom, and so a kind of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>. <br />'But, again, the moon is <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>, the symbol of her varying phases and of her power dependent on the phases. Wherefore her power appears in three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in the white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted: the basket, which she bears when she has mounted high, is the symbol of the cultivation of the crops, which she makes to grow up according to the increase of her light: and again the symbol of the full moon is the goddess of the brazen sandals. <br />'Or even from the branch of olive one might infer her fiery nature, and from the poppy her productiveness, and the multitude of the souls who find an abode in her as in a city, for the poppy is an emblem of a city. She bears a bow, like <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, because of the sharpness of the pangs of labour. <br />'And, again, the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> are referred, to her powers, <a href=/people/1726 target=_blank>Clotho</a> to the generative, and <a href=/people/1920 target=_blank>Lachesis</a> to the nutritive, and <a href=/people/1929 target=_blank>Atropos</a> to the inexorable will of the deity. <br />'Also, the power productive of corn-crops, which is <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, they associate with her, as producing power in her. The moon is also a supporter of <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Kore</a>. They set <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> also beside her, both on account of their growth of horns, and because of the region of clouds lying beneath the lower world. <br />'The power of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> they perceived to be sluggish and slow and cold, and therefore attributed to him the power of time (χρόνου): and they figure him standing, and grey-headed, to indicate that time is growing old. <br />'The <a href=/people/414 target=_blank>Curetes</a>, attending on <a href=/people/4368 target=_blank>Chronos</a>, are symbols of the seasons, because time (<a href=/people/4368 target=_blank>Chronos</a>) journeys on through seasons. <br />'Of the Hours, some are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=demonym long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a>, belonging to the sun, which also open the gates in the air: and others are earthly, belonging to <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>, and hold a basket, one symbolic of the flowers of spring, and the other of the wheat-ears of summer. <br />'The power of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> they perceived to be fiery, and represented it as causing war and bloodshed, and capable both of harm and benefit. <br />'The star of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> they observed as tending to fecundity, being the cause of desire and offspring, and represented it as a woman because of generation, and as beautiful, because it is also the evening star — <br />Hesper, the fairest star that shines in heaven. <br />'And <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> they set by her because of desire. She veils her breasts and other parts, because their power is the source of generation and nourishment. She conies from the sea, a watery element, and warm, and in constant movement, and foaming because of its commotion, whereby they intimate the seminal power. <br />'<a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> is the representative of reason and speech, which both accomplish and interpret all things. The phallic <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> represents vigour, but also indicates the generative law that pervades all things. <br />'Further, reason is composite: in the sun it is called <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>; in the moon <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>; and that which is in the All Hermopan, for the generative and creative reason extends over all things. <a href=/people/7757 target=_blank>Hermanubis</a> also is composite, and as it were half Greek, being found among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> also. Since speech is also connected with the power of love, <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> represents this power: wherefore <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> is represented as the son of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>, but as an infant, because of his sudden impulses of desire. <br />'They made <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> the symbol of the universe, and gave him his horns as symbols of sun and moon, and the fawn skin as emblem of the stars in heaven, or of the variety of the universe.' </p>                        </div>

He sits with a vessel of clay beside him, on which he is moulding the figure of a man. And from having the face of a ram and the horns of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> he indicates the conjunction of sun and moon in the sign of the Ram, while the colour of blue indicates that the moon in that conjunction brings rain. <br />'The second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>: and its symbol is a man with a hawk-like face, subduing with a hunting-spear <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> in the likeness of a hippopotamus. The image is white in colour, the whiteness representing the illumination of the moon, and the hawk-like face the fact that it derives light and breath from the sun. For the hawk they consecrate to the sun, and make it their symbol of light and breath, because of its swift motion, and its soaring up on high, where the light is. And the hippopotamus represents the Western sky, because of its swallowing up into itself the stars which traverse it. <br />'In this city <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a> is worshipped as a god. But the city of <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a> worships the third appearance of the moon: and her statue is fashioned into a flying vulture, whose plumage consists of precious stones. And its likeness to a vulture signifies that the moon is what produces the winds: for they think that the vulture conceives from the wind, and declares that they are all hen birds. <br />'In the mysteries at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> the hierophant is dressed up to represent the demiurge, and the torch-bearer the sun, the priest at the altar the moon, and the sacred herald <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. <br />'Moreover a man is admitted by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> among their objects of worship.

He says that the predictions of the prophets could not be true unless all things were fast bound by fate: which is itself a most silly argument. For he argues as if it were evident or would be more readily admitted by any one, that all the predictions of the so-called prophets came to pass, than that all things take place according to fate, as if the former would not itself be an equally false statement, since plain experience shows the contrary; I mean that not all the things foretold, or rather not the greatest part of them, come to pass. <br />'Thus <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> has brought us his proof, by establishing each proposition from the other. For he wishes to show that all things take place according to fate from the existence of prophecy: but the existence of prophecy he could not prove in any other way, if he did not first assume that all things occur according to fate. <br />'But what method of proof could be more wretched than this? For that some things come to pass according to the plain meaning of what the prophets foretell would be a sign, not of the existence of prophetic science, but of the accidental concurrence of the events in agreement with the predictions — a thing which gives us no indication of any science. <br />'For neither should we call an archer scientific who hit the mark once now and then, but missed many times; nor a physician who killed the greater number of those who were attended by him, but was able to save one sometimes; nor do we ever give the name of science to that which does not succeed in all, or at least in the greatest part of its proper operations. <br />'Now that most of the predictions of the so-called prophets fail, the whole experience of human life would bear witness; and so would these men themselves who profess the art of prophecy, because it is not by this that they help themselves in the exigencies of life, but use sometimes their own judgement, and sometimes the counsel and cooperation of those who have been thought to possess experience in each kind of affairs. <br />'But with regard to the want of consistency in this which we have chosen to call prophecy, we will render fuller proof elsewhere, bringing forward the opinions of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> on this point also. But at present we will add to what has been said only this much, that at most the fact of the so-called prophets speaking truth sometimes in their predictions must be an effect, not of science, but of an accidental cause; for it is not that a man never hits the proposed mark, but that he does not hit it always, nor even in most cases, and not from science even when he does occasionally succeed, this is what we have chosen to call a work of chance — we who have arranged our own ideas in clear order under each term. Further, if even by hypothesis it were true that the prophetic art is able to discern and to foretell all things future, it might be concluded that all things are according to fate, but the usefulness of the art and its benefit to life could never be shown; and it is for this purpose especially that <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> seems to sing the praises of the prophetic art. <br />'For what benefit would it be to us to learn beforehand the misfortunes certain to come to pass, which it would not even be possible to guard against? For how could any one guard against the things which take place according to fate? So that there is no benefit to us in the prophetic art, but rather it would tend to some mischief, by causing mankind to grieve in vain beforehand over the predicted misfortunes which must of necessity come to pass. <br />'For no one will affirm that the prediction of future blessings affords on the other hand equal delight: since man is not naturally so disposed to rejoice over expected blessings, as to be grieved over misfortunes. Especially as we hope that the latter will not happen at all to ourselves, until we hear it: but all of us, so to say, rather look for blessings, because our nature is congenial thereto; for most persons have formed hopes of things even greater than what can possibly come to pass. <br />'Hence it results that the prediction of blessings either does not at all increase the joy, because even apart from the prediction every one of his own accord expects the better fortune, or else increases it but little by the supposed certainty, and often even diminishes the joy, when less is foretold than what was hoped for; but the prediction of evils causes great perturbation, both because of their repulsive nature, and because the prediction is sometimes opposed to men's hopes. <br />'But even if this did not happen, nevertheless it would be evident, I think, to every one that the prediction would be useless. For if any one shall affirm that the usefulness of the prophetic art will be maintained on account of the prediction of the misfortune which will certainly happen unless we should guard against it, he can no longer show that all things are to happen in accordance with fate, if it is in our power either to guard or not to guard against them. <br />'For if any one shall say that this choice also is controlled by necessity, so as to extend fate to all things that exist, the usefulness of prophecy on the other hand is destroyed; for we shall keep guard if it is so fated, and evidently we shall not keep guard if it is not fated that we shall keep guard, even though all the prophets foretell to us what is about to happen. <br />'As to <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a>, for instance, and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> son of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, even <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> himself says that though their parents had recourse to many contrivances to kill them, in order that they might guard against the mischief predicted from them, they were unable to do so. <br />'Thus there was no benefit, he says, even to them from the prediction of the evils, because they were effects proceeding from fate. Let this then be enough, and more than enough, to have been said in regard to not merely the uncertainty but also the uselessness of the prophetic art.' </p>                        </div>

For suppose it should be shown that all men everywhere, both Greeks and Barbarians, before the advent of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, had no knowledge of the true God, but either regarded 'the things that are not as though they were,' or were led about hither and thither like blind men by certain wicked spirits fighting against God, and by evil and impure daemons, and were by them dragged down into an abyss of wickedness (for what else ailed them but possession by daemons?) — how can the great mystery of the Gospel dispensation fail to be seen in a higher light? I mean, that all men from all quarters have been sailed back by our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>'s voice from the delusion handed down from their fathers about the tyranny of daemons, and that the men who dwell as far off as the ends of the earth have been released from the deception which from the earliest age oppressed their whole life. For since His time and up to the present the antiquated seats of delusion in all the heathen nations have been broken up and destroyed — shrines and statues and all — and temples truly venerable, and schools of true religion have been raised up in honour of the Absolute Monarch and Creator of the universe in the midst of cities and villages by the power and goodness of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> throughout the whole world. And by prayers of holy men the sacrifices which are worthy of God have been purified from all wickedness, and in freedom of soul from all passions, and in the acquirement of every virtue, according to the divine doctrines of salvation, are day by day continually offered up by all nations — those sacrifices which alone are acceptable and pleasing to the God who is over all? </p>                        </div>

There is nothing, however, like hearing the writer himself, who tells the story as follows: [DIONYSIUS OF HALICARNASSUS] 'But a small part (of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a>) remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, through the prudence of the Aborigines. The first beginning of ruin to the inhabitants of the cities seeme'd to be the damage of the land by drought, when neither did any fruit remain to ripen upon the trees, but all fell off unripe, nor did any of the seeds, which put forth shoots and blossomed, complete the normal periods for the ripening of the ear; nor did grass grow sufficient for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>; and of the springs some were no longer good to drink, and some were failing from heat, and some completely drying up. And disasters akin to these occurred in regard to offspring of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and women: for the fruit of the womb either miscarried, or perished at the time of birth, in some cases causing death to the mothers also. And whatever escaped the danger of parturition was crippled, or imperfect, or injured through some other mischance, and was not fit to be reared. Then, too, the rest of the population which was in the prime of life began to be ravaged by diseases and deaths of more than ordinary frequency. And when they inquired of oracles, which of the gods or daemons they had offended that they suffered thus, and what they could do with a hope of alleviating their troubles, the god made answer, that, after obtaining what they wished, they had not paid what they vowed, but still owed the most precious part. For when a general dearth had fallen upon their land, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgi</a> made a vow to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> and to the <a href=/people/1091 target=_blank>Cabeiri</a> that they would offer in sacrifice tithes of all future produce: but when their prayer was fulfilled, they chose out the portion of all crops and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and offered these in sacrifice to the gods, as though they had vowed these only. This story is told by <a href=/people/3431 target=_blank>Myrsilus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=person long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a>, who writes in almost the same words as I have now used, except only that he does not call the people <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a> but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenians</a>; and the reason of this I will state a little later. </p>                        </div>

But in their perplexity, one of the older men who had guessed the oracle said, that they had mistaken the whole matter if they supposed that the gods were accusing them unjustly: for though all the first-fruits of property had been rightly and justly paid by them, yet the portion of human offspring, a thing most precious above all to the gods, was still due. But if the gods were to receive their just share of this also, they would then have fully satisfied the oracle. Some thought then that this was good advice, but others that the speech was concocted as part of a plot: and when some one brought forward the proposal that they should ask the god again whether it was his pleasure to receive tenths of men, they sent ambassadors a second time, and the god made answer that they should do so. Hereupon a quarrel arose among them as to the method of choosing the tenths: and the chief men of their cities then first fell into dissension among themselves, and afterwards the rest of the multitude became suspicious of the magistrates; and their emigrations were not made with any order, but as was to be expected when men were driven away by frenzy and infatuation. So when a portion of them migrated, many households were utterly destroyed; for the relatives of those who went forth did not approve of being left behind by their dearest friends and remaining among their worst enemies. These then were the first who removed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and wandered into Greece and many barbarous lands; and after the first emigrants, others had the same feeling, and this went on continuously for years. For those who were in power in the cities did not cease to choose out the victims from the youth who at the time were growing into manhood, both as deeming thus to pay due service to the gods, and because they feared seditious movements from those who had escaped. There were many also who from enmity were driven away by their opponents under a specious pretext; so that the migrations became numerous, and the Pelasgic race was scattered abroad over a very great part of the earth.' </p>                        </div>

So when they had taken thought of this, and saw the enemy encamping close to their walls, they had a superstitious fear of having abolished the honours which their fathers had paid to the gods: and, being eager to amend their errors, they chose out two hundred of their most distinguished sons and offered them as a public sacrifice; and others who were under suspicion gave themselves up of their own accord, in number not less than three hundred.

But in fact I believe it to be hereby clearly proved that the most ancient and primitive erection of carved images and all the idolatrous creation of gods among the heathen was the work of daemons, and of daemons who were not even good, but utterly wicked and worthless: so that the oracle speaks truth which says in the prophecies, 'All the gods of the heathen are daemons'; as also the passage of the Apostle where he says, 'That the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to daemons and not to God.' Or if there was any good one among them, on whose account they might share in the title of the good, he would be a benefactor and saviour of all, a friend of justice, and a guardian of mankind. But if he were such, how could he delight in human slaughter? And why did he not forbid mankind by oracles to follow such practices? Surely he was worse and more wicked than men, since they by legal punishments brought the blood-guilty to a better mind.

Now with respect to the Mysteries, in which we might obtain the, chief indications and elucidations of the truth concerning daemons, 'I must keep a religious silence,' as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> says: but as to festivals and sacrifices, as well as days of ill omen mourning, on which the eating of raw flesh and the rending of victims, and fasting and beating of the breast are practised, and again in many places obscene language at the temples, and other frantic excitements with tumult and tossing of the head, these, I should say, are performed not in honour of any god, but as propitiatory offerings for the sake of averting evil daemons. And it is neither credible that gods demanded or accepted the human sacrifices offered of old, nor, without cause, would kings and generals have submitted to them by giving up their sons and devoting and sacrificing them; but they were trying to avert and to satisfy the anger and sullenness of harsh and stubborn powers of vengeance, or the furious lusts of some, who were neither able nor willing to have intercourse of bodies with bodies. But just as <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> besieged <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368228UOic class=place long=21.947 lat=37.268>Oechalia</a> for the sake of a maiden, so oftentimes strong and violent daemons, demanding a human soul that is enveloped in a body, . . . bring pestilences upon cities and barrenness of the soil, and stir up wars and seditions, until they succeed in obtaining the object of their desire.' </p>                        </div>

Such, he said, was the case also with the legends of <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> and the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>, that there were battles of daemons against daemons, then banishments of the conquered, or punishments by a god of those who had committed sins, such as <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> is said to have committed upon <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>, and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> on <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranos</a>; gods, whose honours among us have become more obscure, or have altogether ceased, since they have departed into another world.

Many stories like these you may gather from the mythologies. But if we call certain daemons by the customary names of the gods, it is not to be wondered at, said the stranger; for each of them likes to be called after the god with whom he has been associated, and of whose power he partakes: even as among us one is <a href=/people/1654 target=_blank>Dius</a>, and another <a href=/people/648 target=_blank>Athenaeus</a>, and a third <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, or <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, or Hermaeus.

But to take as it were a handful out of the verses of <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>, and to lay sins and frenzies and heaven-sent wanderings upon these daemons, and to imagine them dying deaths like men, I consider too bold and barbaric. Hereupon <a href=/people/450 target=_blank>Cleombrotus</a> asked <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> who the young man was, and whence he came; and when he had learned his name and city, he said, We are not ourselves unconscious, <a href=/people/1833 target=_blank>Heracleon</a>, that we have entered upon strange arguments: but in dealing with great subjects it is not possible to arrive at a probable opinion without employing great principles. <br />'But you are yourself unconsciously taking back what you grant. For you admit that daemons exist; but, in claiming that they are not wicked and not mortal, you no longer have daemons to defend. For in what do they differ from the gods, if they are both in regard to essence incorruptible, and in regard to virtue free from passion and from sin? <br />'While <a href=/people/1833 target=_blank>Heracleon</a> was silently pondering in himself some answer to this, <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> said to him, Nay, <a href=/people/1833 target=_blank>Heracleon</a>, that daemons are wicked was admitted not only by <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>, but also by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> and <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>: and moreover when <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> prayed that he might meet with favourable apparitions, it was evident that he knew of others perverse and mischievous, with certain propensities and impulses. <br />'Now with regard to the death of such beings, I have heard a story from a man who was no fool nor braggart. For the father of <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> the rhetorician, whose hearers some of us have been, was <a href=/people/4519 target=_blank>Epitherses</a>, my fellow citizen and grammar-master. He said that once on a voyage to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> he embarked in a ship carrying merchandise and many passengers: and at evening off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383213IEch class=place long=21.02 lat=38.43>Echinades</a> the wind dropped, and the ship drifted and came near to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392202IPax class=place long=20.155 lat=39.1927>Paxi</a>; that most of them were awake, and were drinking after they had supped. And suddenly a voice was heard from the island <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392202IPax class=place long=20.155 lat=39.1927>Paxi</a>, some one calling aloud on <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a>, so that they were amazed. For <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> was the pilot, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, not even known by name to many of those on board. Though called twice however, he kept silence, but the third time he answered him that called. He then raised his voice higher and said, When thou art come off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398200HPel class=place long=20.0305 lat=39.7841>Pelodes</a>, announce that the Great <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> is dead. <br />'On hearing this, <a href=/people/4519 target=_blank>Epitherses</a> said they were all struck with amazement, and began to take counsel together, whether it were better to do what was commanded, or not to meddle with the matter, but let it pass; whereupon <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> decided, that if there should be wind, he would sail past and keep quiet, but if the wind should fail and a calm come on near the place, he would report what he had heard. <br />'When therefore he was come off <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398200HPel class=place long=20.0305 lat=39.7841>Pelodes</a>, as there was neither wind nor sea, <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> looking from the poop towards the land spake as he had heard, that The Great <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> is dead: and he had no sooner ceased speaking than there came a loud lamentation, not of one but of many, mingled with amazement. <br />'And inasmuch as there were many persons present, the tale was soon spread in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and <a href=/people/2454 target=_blank>Thamus</a> was sent for by <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a>. And <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> so fully believed the story, that he made thorough inquiry and research about <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>; and the learned men of his court being present in great number conjectured that it was <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> the son of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> and <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a>. <br />'So then <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> had witnesses to his story in some of those who were present, and had heard it from the aged Aemilian. But <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> said that there were many desert islands scattered about among those on the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, some of which were named after daemons and heroes. And that he himself, being sent by the Emperor to make an investigation and survey, sailed to the nearest of the desert islands, which had but few inhabitants, and these all sacred persons inviolable to the Britons. <br />'Very soon after his arrival there arose a great commotion in the air, and many portents in the sky, and violent blasts of wind, and falling of thunderbolts. And when this abated, the islanders said that one of the higher powers had been extinguished; for as a lamp, they said, while lighted does no harm, but being extinguished is hurtful to many, so great souls are benignant and harmless in their shining, but their extinction and dissolution oftentimes, as now, cause winds and storms, and often infect the air with pestilent diseases. <br />'There was however one island there, in which <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> was confined and guarded in his sleep by <a href=/people/1609 target=_blank>Briareus</a>; for his sleep had been artfully contrived to keep him bound; and there were many daemons about him as attendants and servants.'. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/658 target=_blank>Aristomachus</a> the son of <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a>, because his father had perished in the invasion, comes to thee to learn about the way: for he was eager as his father had been. And thou tellest him, <br />Heaven shows the way to victory through the straits. <br />'So he starts on the enterprise by way of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>, and is killed in battle. His son <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a>, unhappy son of hapless sire, was the third who came to thee, and thou gavest the same promise to him as to his father <a href=/people/658 target=_blank>Aristomachus</a>: and he said, But my father trusted thee, and perished in the invasion. <br />'Then thou said'st, I do not mean straits on land, but on the broad-bosomed, because, I suppose, it was difficult for thee to say simply by the sea. And he went by sea, after making them think that he was making his incursion by land, and he encamped midway between Navatus and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378218LTyp class=place long=21.6593 lat=37.6285>Typaeum</a>. He killed with his spear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386209IKar class=place long=20.926 lat=38.627>Carnus</a> son of Phylander, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=person long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolian</a> knight, doing, as I think, quite rightly. And when a plague presently fell upon them, and <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> died, they returned again, and <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> came and complained of his failure, and was told that he had brought upon himself the penalty for the messenger of the god, and he heard the poem concerning his vow to the <a href=/people/3152 target=_blank>Carnean</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, which told him in the oracular answer, <br />Thou sufferest vengeance for my prophet's death. <br />'What then says <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a>? What must I do? And how can I appease you? <br />To the <a href=/people/3152 target=_blank>Carnean</a> god due honour vow. <br />'O most accursed, and most shameless prophet! Dost thou then not understand that he who hears the word straits will miss its meaning? Yet knowing this thou none the less givest this answer, and then lookest on at his mistake. <br />'But the word strait was ambiguous, and chosen in order that, if he were victorious, thou mightest seem to be the cause of his victory; but, if defeated, not at all to blame for his defeat, being able to take refuge in the broad-bosomed. But the man went on the broad-bosomed, and did not succeed; and again, an excuse is found in the death of thy messenger <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386209IKar class=place long=20.926 lat=38.627>Carnus</a>. <br />'Yet how, most noble god, didst thou, to whom <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386209IKar class=place long=20.926 lat=38.627>Carnus</a> was so dear, bid him be inspired for others, but not for himself? And though thou shouldest have saved <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386209IKar class=place long=20.926 lat=38.627>Carnus</a>, who was but one, how didst thou suffer him to die, and for his death didst bring an Homeric plague upon the multitude, and dictate vows for the plague? <br />'And if he had accomplished nothing by his vow, another excuse would have been found for thy quibble, and ye would never have ceased, they on their side inquiring, and thou quibbling, so that whether they were victorious or defeated thy malpractice would not have been detected. For their passion and eagerness were strong enough to mislead them, so as to make them not distrust thee, even if they were to be slain a thousand times. <br />'To this it is worth while to add the story of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>. He reigned over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>, having received the government as it had come down to him from a long line of ancestors. Then hoping to succeed somewhat beyond his forefathers, he was minded to show piety towards the gods, and, after making trial of them all, he preferred the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, and proceeded to adorn his temple with bowls and ingots of gold, and a countless multitude of offerings, and made it in a short time the richest of all temples in the world; nor in his magnanimity did he omit all that sufficed for sacrifices. <br />'So after he had made such loans to the god, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> king naturally felt confidence in his magnificent works of piety, and resolved to make an expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, expecting to increase his empire greatly by the alliance of the god. <br />'What then did the wonderful oracle-monger do? That very same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a>, friendly god contrives that his suppliant, his dear friend, his client should not only fail to win the foreign empire, but also be driven from his own, the god not doing this at all purposely, I think, but rather in ignorance of what was to happen: for surely it was not with any knowledge of the future (since he was no god nor any superhuman power) that he craftily contrived his response to suit either event, and with the seeming affirmation, <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416359WHal class=place long=35.883 lat=41.569>Halys</a> crossed, <br /><a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> a mighty empire shall destroy, <br />overturned the kingdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> which had come down from a succession of ancestors to the pious king, great and ancient as it was, and rendered to his favoured worshipper this fruit of his extreme zeal towards him.'

That is true. For thou knewest not, O sophist, as in the case of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, what course the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> would take. Therefore thou wast afraid lest thou shouldest bid them flee, and then they should flee, and the enemy never invade them. <br />'Since therefore it was necessary to say something, this is what thou saidst to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>: <br />O habitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>'s spacious streets, <br />Either your glorious city shall be sacked <br />By <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>' warrior sons, or else a king <br />Sprung from the race of mighty <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a><br />Must die, and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=place long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconia</a> mourn his fate. <br />'Again there is the combination most unlike prophecy. However, let it pass, that we may not seem to be both wearisome and incompetent by trampling upon thee twice for the same fault; but let us examine the remaining facts. <br />'In so great a danger all were looking to thee, and thou wast both their informant of the future, and their adviser as to present action. And while they believed thee trustworthy, thou wast sure that they were fools; and that the present opportunity was convenient for drawing on the simpletons, and driving them headlong, not only to the schools of sophistry at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod class=place long=20.7878 lat=39.5464>Dodona</a>, but also to the seats of divination by barley and by wheat-flour, and to the ventriloquists. <br />'For at that time not only the gods were believed, but also <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a> and <a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crows</a>, and the delusions of dreams. It was not difficult therefore to see that they would neither have accepted both misfortunes rather than one, nor the greater instead of the less, and it was less that one, even their king, should fall instead of all. <br />'So then with the fall of the city there would be no escape for him either; but if he were posted somewhere else by himself, perhaps something unexpected might happen. The remaining course then was for those who reasoned thus to send the king to carry on the war, and stay at home themselves out of danger, awaiting the event. <br />'For him therefore, taking his stand with a few against that immense host, destruction was manifest; but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> had a respite from fear, and hopes of the unexpected: while the trick would be equally undetected, whether the city escaped or was captured. <br />'Why so? Because it had not been said, forsooth, that the city should be saved if the king died, but that either he should perish alone or the whole city together: and this answer could not be called to account in either case, whether he were to perish alone or not alone. Such is the fruit of arrogance and folly.' </p>                        </div>

For this is what the poet at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> says. <br />'Now let us look at the question which the happy <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> asks of the god: for I suppose it was something about heaven, and important enough to call forth an answer from the god; otherwise he would not so readily have pronounced him happy, and in addition to this happiness have awarded him an answer. <br />Thou seek'st a fatherland, but none is thine. <br />A motherland thou hast, nor near, nor far <br />From <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>' realm: there is thy doom to die, <br />When from the tongues of schoolboys thou hast heard <br />A long-drawn hymn thou canst not understand. <br />'Was it then a terrible thing, O thou wisest of men, or rather of gods, if this happy man should know neither where on earth he sprang from his mother's womb, nor where he should close his eyes and lie? I should have thought it of equal importance, whether a <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> or one of the beetles came to consult the god on these points, and that the god could no more have given any guidance on such unknown matters to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> than to a beetle. <br />'As for example, if a beetle did not spend his life and his old age on that same dunghill on which he was begotten, but fell in with an adverse wind, and a cruel beetle-daemon, who caught him up into the air and carried him away by force to some other land and some other dunghill, and then he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> and inquired which was the dunghill of his fatherland, and what land would receive him when dead.' Let this suffice then about the poets. </p>                        </div>

A hero then no longer mortal art thou, O <a href=/people/2302 target=_blank>Cleomedes</a>, for inventing such contrivances to attain immortality. <br />'The gods at least were immediately sensible of thy good deeds, and snatched thee up to heaven, just as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s gods snatched <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a>; but him they chose for his beauty, and thee for thy strength, and for the good use made of it! <br />'I wish therefore, O prophet, as I said, that thou hadst let alone the sand and the sea, and instead of them hadst learned how much boxing is worth, that thou mightest regard the pugnacious <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> as gods, and the wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>asses</a> as the very best of the gods: and there would have been some proper oracle over the death of a wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, rather than over thy boxer: <br />Chief of the deathless gods is a wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, not <a href=/people/2302 target=_blank>Cleomedes</a>; <br />Now no longer a mortal with sacrifice honour him duly. <br />'For indeed you must not wonder, if even a wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> should lay claim to immortality, as being fully provided with divine qualifications, and should not endure what he heard, but should threaten that with a blow he would knock even <a href=/people/2302 target=_blank>Cleomedes</a> himself into the pit, and not permit him to go up to heaven. <br />'For he would say that he was more worthy of the very gifts of the gods than <a href=/people/2302 target=_blank>Cleomedes</a>, as being ready to fight not with him alone, even if he were to use thongs of iron, but also with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> boxer, both at once, him I mean on account of whose statue the gods were aggrieved, and made the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a> barren. <br />'About this man also we trust to no human testimony but to that of the same god. And from these facts I clearly perceived that boxing was, as we said, a godlike pursuit, though most persons, even those who think themselves wise, were not aware of it: or they would have given up being gentlemen, and would have practised the art of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=demonym long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasian</a> boxer, whom the gods, though they did not grant immortality to him, as they did to <a href=/people/2302 target=_blank>Cleomedes</a>, yet loved much. <br />'Thus his statue of bronze exhibited a power beyond the images of other men, by falling down upon his enemy who was scourging it, which seems to show a kind of divine solicitude. <br />'But the senseless <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a>, having no experience in things divine, were indignant and accused the statue of a crime, and exacted punishment, and ventured to sink it in the sea. <br />'They did not escape however, these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a>, but the gods showed them how great a wrong they had dared to commit, by sending a famine upon them as the minister of divine justice, which with difficulty taught them what the counsels of the gods were; and thou the most philanthropic of gods didst send them help in thine own fashion, saying: <br />Bring thy banished ones home, and gather a liberal harvest. <br />'But again the stupid people supposed that they must recall the men who were in banishment: but they were mistaken; for as the gods have no love at all for mankind, what care they about men being recalled from banishment, in comparison with their care for statues? For this of course the land gained no help towards being relieved of its barrenness, but that some wise person who understood the mind of the gods conceived that the banished one was the statue which had been drowned in the sea. And so it was. For no sooner was it set up again, than immediately the land began to flourish, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a> thenceforward (enjoying abundant harvests) wore long hair in honour of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>. <br />'Must not then these be clear proofs that a godlike athleticism is honoured by the gods? For again the gods were wroth because of an insult to the statue of a conqueror in the pentathlum, and for this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=ethnic long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locrians</a> were famished, like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=ethnic long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasians</a>, until they found a remedy in thy oracle, running thus: <br />Hold the dishonoured in honour, and then shalt thou plough up thy land. <br />'For neither did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=ethnic long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locrians</a> perceive the meaning of the gods before they had thee to help them in the matter. But they had cast the pentathlete <a href=/people/2879 target=_blank>Euthycles</a> into prison, on a charge of having received bribes against his country: and not only so, but after he was dead they committed outrages upon his statues, until the gods could not endure their conduct, and sent the most violent famine upon them. And they would have utterly perished by the famine, had there not come help from thee, saying that they ought to honour men trained and fattened, who are no less dear to the gods than the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> which the millers fatten, and by sacrificing which men sometimes win your assent. Not less perhaps, but even much more, than fat <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> do you delight in fat men, so that sometimes you grow angry with a whole city and a whole nation, because one or two persons do wrong to these failings. <br />'How I wish then, O prophet, thou hadst been our trainer instead of prophet, or both prophet and trainer together, that as there is a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> oracle so there might have been a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> gymnasium.

But since we seem to be at leisure to hold even a long conversation, and since the subject is of no slight importance, tell me this, for perhaps a few points out of many are sufficient. <br />'Are we, I and thou, anything? You will say, Yes. But whence do we know this? Whereby did we determine that we do know it? Is it not the fact that nothing else is so satisfactory a proof (of our existence) as our conscious sensation and apprehension of ourselves? <br />' What again? How did we ever find out that we are animals? And how that among animals we are, as I should say, men, and among men one an impostor, and another an exposer of impostors; but as thou would'st say, the one a man, the other a god, and the one a prophet, the other a false accuser? And let it be as thou sayest, if I be proved wrong. <br />'But how do we know that we are conversing at the present moment? What sayest thou? Did we not rightly judge our apprehension of ourselves by that which is most immediate, the fact itself? Evidently so. For we found nothing else either higher than it, or prior to it, or more trustworthy. <br />'For if this is not to be so, then let not hereafter one named <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a> come to thee at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, after he has slain his mother, and been driven from home, and is longing to return home. For he knows not either whether he himself is anything at all, nor whether he is driven from home, nor whether he is longing for home. But even if <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a> is mad, and imagines things that do not exist, yet the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god at least is not mad. And thou must not speak to him thus: <br />How to return to thy home thou seek'st, son of <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>. <br />'For even thou knowest not yet whether any son of <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> is consulting thee, nor whether thou, the consulted, art anything at all, and able to answer concerning the matters on which he consults thee. <br />'Neither therefore let <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, the author of the semi-slavery, whatever that exactly is, attend in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a>, nor think that those drivellers will attend there to listen to him, the Nobody: neither let him take his stand and struggle about nothing against <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> present in person, and <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> not present. <br />'For what <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> is, and what <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, or what the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Stoa</a> is, or what the young men, or what the Nobody, he neither knows nor can know; for he knows not even, what comes far earlier, whether he himself is anything. <br />'But neither will you gods nor <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> endure that any one should talk thus: for there is no more trustworthy criterion than that of which I speak; nor if there seem to be any others, could they be made equal to this, or, if made equal, could not surpass it. <br />'So then, some one may say, since thou, O <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, and thou, O <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, and thou, O prophet, are indignant if any one should wish to deny your consciousness of yourselves — for of those many books of yours it is no longer possible to deny the existence — come, let us also be indignant on the other side. <br />'How, pray? Is this self-consciousness to be the most trustworthy and primary evidence wherever it pleases you? but where it pleases you not, is there some occult power, <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>, or Destiny, to tyrannize over it? — a power having for each of you a different meaning, proceeding according to one from god, and according to another from those minute bodies which are carried down, and tossed up, and twirled round, and broken up, and separated, and combined by necessity? <br />'For lo! the manner of our self-consciousness is the same in which we are also conscious of our voluntary or enforced actions. And we are not unconscious of the great difference between walking and being carried, or between choosing and being compelled. <br />'But do you ask the reasons for which I bring these matters into the discussion? Because thou, O prophet, hast failed to perceive things over which we have power, and thou that knowest all things seemest not to know these which are fast moored to our own will. <br />'And it was evident that this would be the source of no little trouble: for he who knows not the source, which was the cause of the consequences, would be likely, I suppose, to know the consequences themselves! <br />'Evidently then he was an impudent prophet who foretold to <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a> that his son would kill him: for the son surely would be master of his own will, and neither any <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, nor any higher than he, would be able by any power to attain to a knowledge of things which neither exist at present, nor need ever come into existence. <br />'For surely the most ridiculous of all things is this, the mixture and combination of the two notions, that there is something in men's own power, and that there is nevertheless a fixed chain of causation. For, as the wiser sort say, it is like the account in <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>. <br />'For that <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a> should choose to beget a child, was in the power of <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a> himself, and this had escaped the notice of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>: but after he had begotten a son, there lay upon him an inevitable necessity of dying by his son's hand. In this way therefore the necessity dependent on the future event supplied to the prophet his presentiment of what would take place. <br />'But I suppose the son also, as well as the father, was master of his own will: and as the latter had the power of begetting or not, so the son had the power of slaying or not. Now this is the character of all your oracular answers: and this was that which the <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> said: <br />And all thy house shall wade through streams of blood: <br />'namely, that the son shall be blinded by his own hand, on account of the marriage with his mother and of the sovereignty to which he succeeded for his solution of the riddle; and that his sons shall fall by mutual slaughter, because of the banishment of the one from the kingdom, and the ambition of the other, and the marriage of the exile at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and the expedition of seven ridiculous chieftains, and the battle: and since these things were separately dependent on many causes and powers, how could it be possible for thee to understand, or for the chain of causes to bind them together? <br />'For if on the contrary <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oedipus</a> being his own master had not wished to reign, or, having wished and accomplished this, had not chosen to marry <a href=/people/1419 target=_blank>Jocasta</a>, or after marrying had not been puffed up with pride, nor been desponding and disagreeable, how could the several events have been brought to pass? How could he have torn out his eyes? Or how could he have cursed his sons with the curse described by <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> and thee? <br />'In what way too could the events which followed these have taken place, if there were no causes existing before thou could'st tell anything about the future? And again, if the sons had agreed and reigned together, or if they had made an arrangement to reign by turns and adhered to the terms settled; or if he who was banished had determined to go off not to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> but to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> or to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398232RPer class=ethnic long=22 lat=39.85>Perrhaebi</a>; or if after having arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> he had decided to be a salt-fish-monger, and not to take a rich wife but some poor workwoman or huckstress; or if <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a> had not given him his daughter, or if he had given her, but <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polynices</a> had not desired to return home; or if, though desiring it, he had restrained himself; or if <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a> had given no heed to his request for alliance in war; or if neither <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a> nor <a href=/people/183 target=_blank>Tydeus</a> nor the several other commanders of divisions would follow <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a>; or if, though they followed, <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polynices</a> on arriving had not fought with his brother, but either had reigned together with him by agreement, or, if he refused, had retired, being persuaded by what <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> says: <br />How foolishly thou com'st thine home to sack; <br />'or if, not this one, but the other had listened to those other <a href=/people/9385 target=_blank>Euripidean</a> subtleties: <br />Are sun and night content to serve man's need, <br />And wilt thou bear no equal in the house? <br />'how in any such case could they have joined battle, and all the house of <a href=/people/465 target=_blank>Laius</a> waded through blood? <br />'However, these things, you will say, have come to pass. They have come to pass: but by what way didst thou attain to the knowledge of them? Dost thou not see how frequently the whole action of the play has been broken through by the power which lies in us who perform the action? And so I will take whatever supposed case thou wilt, and cut across that chain of yours, and show that it is impossible. <br />'Yet thou wilt say that thou knowest the last links of the supposed case. Yes, but the whole case has been regulated by the force of our interruption of the chain. <br />'Or perhaps thou dost not understand what I mean? Yet in every supposed case, O prophet, there are the living beings often making either few or many fresh beginnings therein. And these beginnings having cut across the events preceding them always themselves bring others on: and these latter may proceed as long as no other beginning supervenes from any source, commanding the events which come after it to conform not to those which went before but to itself. <br />'Now such afresh beginning may be either an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, or a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, or a flea. For surely, by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>! thou wilt not rob even the flea of his free will: but the flea will act upon a certain impulse of his own, and being sometimes mixed up with human affairs will make himself the commencement of some new course; and thou art unconsciously consulting this kind of animal. <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224RTra class=place long=22.4 lat=38.75>Trachis</a>, the home of godlike <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, <br />Thou hast destroyed, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=demonym long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrian</a>; and on thee <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> hath sent curses, and shall yet send more. <br />'What sayest thou? Had it not then been destined by you gods to be destroyed? And why are we mortals to blame, and not that necessity of yours? Thou doest not justice, O <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, nor art right in laying the punishment upon us who do no wrong. <br />'And this <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> of yours, I mean the necessity of your necessity, why does he take vengeance upon us, and not upon himself (if he must punish some one), for having shown the necessity to be of such a character? And why too does he threaten us? Or why, as if we were the masters of this event, do we suffer famine for it? Moreover it will either be rebuilt by us, or not; and whichever it may be, this has been fixed by fate. <br />'Cease therefore from thy wrath, O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the lord of famine: for that which has been destined will be, and that is what thy chain has been appointed to do: and we are nothing compared to it. And thou too cease, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, from uttering vain oracles: for just that which will be, will be, even though thou keep silence. And what is to be done to us, O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, who are not at all the causes of your enactment of law, enactment, that is, of necessity. Or what have we to do with your threatened curses, which yourselves deserve to bear for what we were compelled by necessity to do? Oeteans, rush not in blind frenzy on. <br />'Why, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, we are not rushing on, but are being driven, and not by blind frenzy, but by that necessity of yours. <br />'And how is it, O <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, that thou praisest that famous <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, who was not virtuous either willingly or by choice, but unwillingly? That is if a man can be virtuous unwillingly. But what ye do now is just as if one were to praise and honour those who are beautiful in body, but to blame and punish the ugly. <br />'For the wicked might justly say to you, You did not permit us, O ye gods, to become virtuous; and not only so, but you even forced us to be wicked. And as to the virtuous, if they walk about with their elbows stuck out, one will not permit it, but will say to them, O <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> and <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a> and the rest of your band, since you have been made to be virtuous, I give praise to virtue, but no praise to you in whom virtue resides. <br />'Nay, even <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, against whom you, <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, so often railed, I acquit of the charges, so far at least as you can judge. For how is he to blame, who was not of his own accord luxurious or unjust, as you so often reproached him? <br />Well ordered lives the gods approving view, <br />And welcome holy offerings of the just. <br />'Now it seems to me that you gods would not say this, unless you were persuaded that men seek the objects of their pursuit not involuntarily but with a will: and after what has been already proved, no sophist either divine or human will dare to say that whatever men will is ordained by fate: or else we shall no longer use reasoning with him, but take a stout strap, as for an unruly boy, and curry his ribs right well.' </p>                        </div>

For in his first book Of <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> wishing to show that all things are comprehended under necessity and fate, he employs among certain other testimonies the following expressions in the poet <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: <br />For me the hateful doom of death, <br />E'en from my birth assigned, too soon hath yawn'd, <br />'and: Though the time shall come For him to suffer all such things as fate <br />Decreed, when first his thread of life was spun; <br />'and again: <br />His fate I say no mortal e'er hath shunned. <br />'But he does not observe that the expressions elsewhere used by the Poet are directly opposed to these, I mean those which <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> himself employs in his Second Book, when he wishes to prove that there are also many things caused by us, as for example: <br />They by their own presumptuous folly died, </p>                        </div>

Nor indeed was he able to perceive even this, that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> by no means bears witness to his dogma even in those former verses. For it will be found from them that he suggests not that all things are brought to pass according to fate, but rather that certain things occur according thereto. <br />'For the passage — <br />For me the hateful doom of death, <br />E'en from my birth assigned, too soon hath yawned  — <br />'could not mean that all things occur according to fate, but only just that he was soon to die: for most truly it is fated that every being born into life must die. <br />'Moreover the passage — <br />Though the time shall come <br />For him to suffer all such things as fate <br />Decreed, when first his thread of life was spun  — <br />'has the same meaning. For it does not say that all things which are to befall him hereafter will occur according to fate, but that certajn things will occur to him according to necessity.

For he says that destiny (πεπρωμενην) is a certain arrangement determined (πεπερασμενην) and concluded, and that fate (ειμαρμενην) is a kind of bond woven (ειρομενην) either out of the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, or of any other cause. <br />' Moreover the goddesses of fate (Μοιρας) have been so called from some one of them having been assigned (μεμερισθαι) and allotted to each of us. In the same way he says that the word το χρεων (the debt) is used, meaning the portion that falls to our share and is due to us according to fate. And the number of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> suggests the three periods in which all things revolve, and by which they are fulfilled. <br />'<a href=/people/1920 target=_blank>Lachesis</a> is so called from casting lots (λαγχανειν) for each man's destiny: <a href=/people/1929 target=_blank>Atropos</a> from the unchanging (ατρεπτον) and unalterable character of the distribution; and <a href=/people/1726 target=_blank>Clotho</a> from all things being twisted together (συγκλεκωσθαι) and woven, and from their having only one appointed solution. For by this and the like silly talk he thinks that he proves the necessity present in all things. <br />'But it occurs to me to wonder if in speaking thus he was not conscious of his own nonsensical talk. For let it be granted that men entertained these notions when they imposed the names that have been set forth, according to his own etymologies, and supposed that fate had bound all things fast, and that the causes which had been from eternity predetermined were immutable in all real existences and all passing events. <br />'What then, <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>? do you follow all the opinions of mankind, and does not one of them appear to you to be mistaken on any point, and are all men capable of seeing the truth? <br />'How then say you that there is no man who does not seem to you as mad as <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> and <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a>, except the wise? And there have been, say you, only one or two wise, and the rest for their folly have been equally mad with those whom I have named? <br />'And how do you refute the errors of those opinions of theirs about riches, for example, and fame, and sovereignty, and pleasure in general, things which most men have thought good? How say you, too, that the established laws and the constitutions of states have all been wrong? Or why did you write such a multitude of books, if on no point mankind held mistaken opinions? <br />'For we must not say that, when they hold the same opinions with you, they judge rightly, but when they differ, are mad. <br />'For in the first place even you do not call yourself wise, much less do we, that we should make their concurrence with your opinion a criterion of their good judgement at any time; and further, even if this were true, why should you say that they are all equally mad, instead of commending them, in as far as they appeared to be of the same opinions with you, for having got hold of a right opinion, and considering them to be wrong, in as far as they dissented from you? <br />'Not even thus, however, was it natural to suppose that their opinion is an adequate evidence of the truth; and every one would acknowledge, not that he is mad, as you think, but that he is far removed from wisdom. <br />'It will be ridiculous therefore for you to use these men, whom vou would declare to be no better than yourself in understanding, as bearing witness by their imposition of the names, unless indeed it has happened that those who originally gave these names were wise men — a thing which you cannot possibly prove. <br />'However, let it be granted to you that this is so, and that those names are given with their significations as you wish, and that this circumstance has not been a result of false opinions: where then do they indicate that all things without exception are in accordance with fate, and not rather these only, if any, with which fate is concerned. <br />'For the number of the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>, and their names, and <a href=/people/1726 target=_blank>Clotho</a>'s spindle, and the thread wound upon it, and the ball of this thread, and all other such things mentioned in that story, indicate the immutability and eternal fitness of the causes in all things which are bound by necessity to take place thus, and all which are hindered from being otherwise. <br />'And there would be many things of this nature; but others are not so; and to some of these latter men ascribed gods as rulers and creators, and of some they supposed us to be ourselves the causes, and of others again nature, and of others fortune: and of this last they wished to indicate the changefulness and instability, and its turning now this way and now that; and to show this kind of casualty in affairs by an image, they represented <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> as standing on a globe. <br />'Or are not even these opinions held among mankind? For if at times men confuse the causes, and think that those things which are the results of fate or fortune proceed from a divine power, and that the things of which we are the cause depend on fate, yet surely it is manifest to every one that they think there are all these causes in things. <br />'So the result is that neither the notions adopted by mankind, nor the imposition of such names as have been mentioned, bear testimony to the opinion of <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>.' </p>                        </div>

That a man's cloak should not be lost, was fated, he says, not absolutely but with the condition of its being carefully kept: and that this or that man should be saved from the hands of the enemy, with the condition of his fleeing from the enemy: and the birth of children, with the willingness to cohabit with a wife. <br />'For just as it would be absurd, says he, if, upon some one's saying that <a href=/people/9480 target=_blank>Hegesarchus</a> the boxer would come off from the fight without a single scratch, a man were to recommend <a href=/people/9480 target=_blank>Hegesarchus</a> to fight with his hands down, because it was fated that he was to come off untouched, whereas he who made the assertion said so because of the man's superabundant caution against being hit; so it is also in all other cases. <br />'For many things cannot take place without the addition of our willing them, and bringing into play the most intense earnestness and zeal concerning them, because it was fated, he says, that they were to take place with this condition. <br />'Here then again one may wonder at the man's want of discernment and consideration, both of the sensible evidences and of the inconsequence of his own arguments. For I imagine that just as what we call sweet is the direct opposite of what is called bitter, and black of white, and hot of cold, so what depends on us is the direct opposite of what depends on fate; if at least it is assumed that one calls the effects of fate whatever things take place absolutely whether we will or no, and effects of our action whatever things come to their fulfilment from our diligence and energy, or fail of fulfilment in consequence of our carelessness and indolence. <br />'If therefore my diligence in guarding the cloak be the cause of its being saved, and a man's will to consort with his wife the cause of the children being born, and the will to flee from his enemies the cause of his escape from being killed by them, and the fighting bravely against his antagonist and guarding against the blows from his hands the cause of his coming off from the contest without a scratch, how is the dependence on fate to be maintained here? For if these results follow from fate, they cannot be said to follow from our will: but if from us, then evidently not from fate, because these cannot concur one with the other. <br />'But, says he, they will follow from our will, that will however having been included in fate. But how included (I should say), if at least both the guarding the cloak and the not guarding it proceeded from my free will? For thus it is evident that its preservation also would be in my power. <br />'Also from the very distinction which <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> makes, it becomes evident that our causation is freed from fate. For, says he, it is fated that the cloak be preserved, if thou guard it: and that there will be children, if also thou shouldst will it; but otherwise none of these things would have to take place. But in the case of things predetermined by fate we should never employ these pretended conditions. <br />'So we do not say that every man will die, if so and so should happen, and that he will not die if it should not happen, but simply that he will die, whatsoever may be done to prevent his dying at all; nor do we say that a certain man will be incapable of feeling pain, even if he do this or that; but that every man is capable of feeling pain, whether he wish it or not: and so of all other things which are fated to be in this way and no other. <br />'So that if it is necessary that this or that should take place, if we should wish it, but otherwise not, it is manifest that our wishing or not wishing was not previously constrained by any other cause, but was in our own power. <br />'And if this was not subject to necessity, it is evident also that the occurrence of this or that was not eternally predetermined, unless even the very wish to guard the cloak, or the unwillingness, was a consequence of some fate and the effect of some external necessary cause. <br />'But in this latter case the power of our free will is utterly destroyed, and the cause of the cloak being saved or being lost would no longer be in me; wherefore also I should reasonably be free from blame if it were lost (for its loss was due to some other cause), and on the other hand I should deserve no praise if it were saved, because even this was not my doing. But you were as positive with your argument as if you could make all sure.' </p>                        </div>

For although all events do not require so many causes, yet those which require the most do not exceed the said number. <br />'But the difference between them will be more easy to recognize, if it be seen in some example of what occurs. Let us then show the distinction of causes in the case of a statue. Now as the efficient cause of the statue there is the artist who made it, whom we call the sculptor: and as matter, the bronze substance, or stone, or whatever that may be which is shaped by the artist according to his art: for this also is a cause of the production and existence of the statue. <br />'Again, the form also, which is produced in this substance by the artist, is itself a cause of the statue: wherefore the form is either a man throwing a quoit, or a javelin, or it is of some other definite shape. <br />'These, however, are not the only causes of the production of the statue, but the end for the sake of which it has been made — that is either the honour of some person, or piety towards a god — is inferior to none of the causes of its production. For without a cause the statue would not have been made at all. <br />'Since therefore the causes are so many, and their mutual differences easily recognized, we might justly reckon fate among the efficient causes, as bearing a relation to its own effects analogous to the art which creates the statue. <br />'This being so, it would follow that we should direct our argument to efficient causes: for thus it will be known whether we ought to regard fate as the cause of all things that are done, or to make room also for some other things besides this as being efficient causes of certain things. <br />'Now <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, in making his classification of all things that are done, says that some of them are done for the sake of something, the doer of them having before him a certain aim and end of what is done; and others for the sake of nothing, namely all such as are not done in consequence of any purpose of the doer, nor have reference to any definite end, being such as, for instance, either holding fast a straw or twisting it about, and either stroking or pulling one's hair, and all actions of this kind. <br />'For that these things are done is well known; but they are without the final cause which is the purpose to be gained. Of things therefore which are done in this way, without aim or object, there can be no reasonable classification. <br />'But of those things which have reference to something, and are done for the sake of something, some take place according to nature, others according to reason. For those which have nature as the cause of their production advance according to certain numbers and definite order to some end, on reaching which they cease to be produced — unless any obstacle hinder them in their natural course to this appointed end. <br />'Also those things which are done according to reason have some end; for nothing done according to reason is done at random, but they all have reference to some end. <br />'Now things which are done according to reason are all such as are produced by the doers reasoning about them, and contriving in what way they may be done. In this way are produced all things which are done according to the rules of art, and those which result from a deliberate purpose. <br />'And these differ from the products of nature, because these latter have both their origin and the causes of the special character with which they are produced in themselves (for their nature is of this special character); and because they are produced in a certain order, although the nature which is their efficient cause does not employ any reasoning about them, in the same way as do the arts. <br />'But the results of art and of deliberate purpose have the origin of their movement and their efficient cause from without, and not in themselves, and the maker's calculation concerning them guides their production. <br />'A third class among things done for some end, namely those that are believed to result from chance or spontaneous action, and which differ from those that are primarily done with some purpose in this way, that in the latter case the means which precede the end are employed for the sake of the end, while in the former cases the actions preceding the end are done for some other end, but while so done for another purpose there occurs to them as an end that which is said to be spontaneous and accidental. <br />'Now these things being so, and all things that are done having been distributed into these four kinds, it follows upon this that we should see among which of the efficient causes we must set fate. <br />'Is it among those things which are done for no purpose? Or is this altogether unreasonable? For we always use the name fate in regard to some end, and say that this has been brought about in accordance with fate. Wherefore we must necessarily set fate among the things which have a final cause.' </p>                        </div>

For oftentimes careful treatment, and changes in the mode of life, and the directions of physicians, and the counsels of the gods avail to drive off a condition of this kind. <br />'In the same way in the case of the soul also one might find, contrary to the natural condition, preferences and practices and modes of life different in each of those who were improving from discipline and studies, and better counsels. . . . <br />'For example, when the physiognomist once said some absurd things about <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> the philosopher, very far removed from his chosen course of life, and was being derided for it by the companions of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> said that <a href=/people/1101 target=_blank>Zopyrus</a> had made no mistake: for he would have been of such a character, as far as it depended on his nature, had he not become better than his nature through the discipline of philosophy.' </p>                        </div>

For when a man, in digging for another purpose, and not to find treasure, has lighted upon a treasure, he has found it, he says, by chance. Also when a man has gone into the market for some other purpose, and falls in with his debtor with money in his hand, and receives what is due to him, men say he has recovered his money by chance. Also when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, in hope of food or for some other purpose, has escaped from those who were holding him, but is met in his flight and course by falling into the hands of his masters, he is said by some to have been saved accidentally. Under such conditions these cannot be the results of fate. <br />'There are also some causes undiscoverable by human reason, which are believed to occur in consequence of certain antipathies, the real cause of their occurrence being unknown. Such are the effects which certain amulets have been presumed to produce, though they have no reasonable and probable cause to produce these effects: incantations also, and certain conjurings of this kind. For the cause of these things is acknowledged by all men to be obscure: for which reason they call them αναιτιολογετα, things of which the cause cannot be explained. <br />'And there are besides these many things which occur contingently, and whichever way it happens, and neither can these be according to fate. <br />'By contingent events are meant those wherein it was possible that they might not happen, as is also made clear by the very expression, whichever way it happens: as for example, the moving of one's own limbs, and the casual turning of the neck, and stretching out a finger, and lifting the eyebrows, or that one who is sitting should stand up, and one who is moving should become still, and one who is talking become silent; and in thousands of cases one would find that there existed a power capable of the opposite effects, and these cases cannot depend on fate: for the things which depend on fate do not admit the opposite of their actual condition. <br />'Moreover, a man's power of deliberation is not given to him without purpose: yet he would have this power of deliberation to no purpose, if he performed his actions from necessity. But it evidently appears that man alone has from nature this advantage over the other animals, that he does not follow the impressions of sense as they do, but has in his reason a judge of the circumstances which befall him: and by using this, if the things presented by sense are, on examination, such as they at first appeared, he assents to the impression, and so will pursue them: but if they appear to be different, he no longer abides by his previous conception, after reason has proved the representations false, in consequence of his deliberating upon them. <br />'At any rate we deliberate only about things which we have power to do: and whenever we act without having deliberated, we often repent and blame ourselves for our want of consideration: and further, if we see others acting inconsiderately, we charge them with doing wrong, and bid them consult such and such advisers, as knowing that such actions are in our own power. <br />'That their argument about fate is false, is sufficiently testified by the fact that even its champions themselves are not able to conform to their own statements. For they profess to exhort and to teach, and they advise men to learn and to be educated, and they reprove and punish those who do things that are not right, as sinning of their own will. Moreover, they leave behind them very many books, by which they expect the young to be educated. They would have ceased, therefore, from being so eager in their arguments if they had observed that (in their books) they claim forgiveness for involuntary offenders, but say that voluntary transgressors deserve punishment, implying evidently that to offend or not lies in their own power. <br />'Thus even according to their own account the necessity arising from fate is abolished, and it is established that free-will is ours by nature, with the limitation that there are also very many things not in our own power, as the effects of natural laws, and the accidents of fortune, though even these are contrary to the doctrine of fate, as we have previously shown.' </p>                        </div>

A <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> is carnivorous, and takes revenge if he be injured: and therefore all <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> are carnivorous and take revenge. Ewe <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> eat grass, and touch no flesh, and if injured take no revenge: and every <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a>'s character is the same. <br />'A scorpion eats earth, and injures those who have not injured him, striking with a venomous sting: and all scorpions have the same evil disposition. An ant knows by nature the advent of winter, and by toiling through the whole summer stores up food for itself: and all ants work in like manner. <br />'A <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> makes honey, and also feeds upon it: and all <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> follow the same husbandry. And I might have set before you many kinds of animals, which being unable to depart from their own nature might have caused you much wonderment. But I thought I had given sufficient proof from the examples set forth, that all other animals according to the community or diversity of nature given to each are borne along pleasantly by necessity. <br />'But men alone, having as their special privilege the mind, and the reason which proceeds from it, in what they have in common follow nature, as I said before, but as to their special gift are not governed by nature. <br />'For they do not all even eat the same food: some feed like <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, and others like <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>: they have not one fashion of raiment: there is not one custom, nor one law of civil society among them, nor one impulse of desire for things: but each man chooses a life for himself according to his own will, not imitating his neighbour, except in what he chooses. <br />'For his freedom is subject to no slavery, and if ever he shall voluntarily be a slave, this also is a part of his freedom, that he is able to be a voluntary slave. <br />'How many of mankind, and especially among the <a href=/people/2232 target=_blank>Alans</a>, eat raw flesh, like wild beasts, without tasting bread, and not because they have it not, but because they are not willing! Others, like tame animals, taste no flesh: some eat only fish; while others never taste fish, not even if they be starving. Some drink water, some drink wine, and some drink strong liquor. <br />'And in short there is a great difference among mankind in food and drink, as they differ even in the eating of vegetables and fruits. Moreover some, like scorpions and like asps, injure without having been injured; and some, like other animals, revenge themselves when injured: and others ravage like <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, and steal like weasels; while others, like <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, are pursued by men of like feelings with themselves, and do no injury to those who injure them. Some also are called good, and some bad, and some just. <br />'Whence we may understand that man is not altogether led by nature (for of what kind shall we say his nature is?): but is borne one way according to nature, and another way according to will. Wherefore he incurs praise and blame and condemnation in matters dependent on will: but in matters dependent on nature he has immunity from blame, not out of pity, but from reason.' </p>                        </div>

But as I said before, each nation and each man uses his own freedom as he will and when he will, and is also a slave of his nativity and the nature which clothes him with flesh, sometimes according to his will, and sometimes contrary to his will. For everywhere and in every nation there are rich and poor, rulers and ruled, healthy and sickly, each according to the lot of his nativity. <br />'These arguments, O Bardesanes, said I, have entirely persuaded me. But the astrologers say that this earth is divided into seven zones, and that one of the seven stars rules each zone; and that the different laws have not been enacted by men for themselves, but the will of each ruling star prevails in his own region, and is regarded by those under his rule as law. <br />'He replied: This answer of theirs, O <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, is not true. For although the earth is divided into seven zones, yet nevertheless we find many differences of laws in the same division. For there are neither seven laws corresponding to the seven stars, nor twelve corresponding to the signs of the zodiac, nor thirty-six corresponding to the decani, but numberless laws. <br />'You ought also to remember what I said before, that in the same clime and same region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> there are <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> who are cannibals, and there are those who abstain from animal food; also that the <a href=/people/9737 target=_blank>Magusaei</a> marry their daughters not only in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, but also in every nation where they may dwell, observing the laws of their forefathers, and the initiatory rites of their mysteries. <br />'Also, we gave a list of many barbarous nations living in the South and West and East and North, that is in different climes, who have no share in the science of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. <br />'How many wise men, think you, have set aside badly constituted laws? And how many laws have been abolished from being impracticable? How many kings after gaining power over nations have changed the laws that were before their time and established their own? Yet none of the stars had lost its proper clime. <br />'Yesterday the Romans having become masters of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> changed the laws of the barbarians. For one free-will follows another free-will. But I will now set forth for you a fact which might convince even the incredulous. <br />'The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who received a law through <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> all shed the blood of their male children by circumcising them on the eighth day, not waiting for the appearance of a star, nor respecting the influence of clime, nor yielding to any law of a foreign country: but whether they are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, or Gaul, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, or Greece, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, or wherever they may be, they perform this rite. <br />'And this is not dependent on nativity, for all <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> cannot have the same natal stars. Moreover every seventh day, wherever they may be, they abstain from all work, and neither travel nor use fire: nor does his nativity compel a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> either to build or to demolish a house, to work, to buy or to sell on the sabbath day, although on that same day <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> beget and are begotten, and sicken and die: for these are things not dependent on freewill. <br />'In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370390ROsr class=place long=39 lat=37>Osrhoene</a> many used to mutilate themselves in honour of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>: hereupon king <a href=/people/4806 target=_blank>Abgar</a> at one stroke commanded that those who cut off the genital organs should also have their hands cut off, and from thenceforth no one in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370390ROsr class=place long=39 lat=37>Osrhoene</a> mutilated himself. <br />'And what shall we say concerning the sect of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>? For we who hold those opinions have arisen in multitudes in different climes, in every nation and region, and though many in number, are called by one name. <br />'And neither in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> do the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> though they are, practise polygamy, nor do those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> cast their dead to <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, nor do those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, though they are <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, marry their daughters, nor among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a> and the Gauls do they form unnatural unions, nor do those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> worship <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> or the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, the he-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, or the <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a>. But wherever they are, they are neither overcome by ill-constituted laws and customs, nor does their nativity, regulated by their ruling stars, compel them to practise the evils forbidden by their teacher, but they submit to sickness and poverty and sufferings and reputed infamies. <br />'For as the free man of our idea is not compelled to be a slave, and, even if he be compelled, resists those who compel him, so also the man whom we regard as a slave cannot easily escape from his subjection. <br />'For if we could do all things, we ourselves should be the all, even as, if we could do nothing, we should be instruments, as I said before, of others, and not masters of ourselves. But with God's approval all things are possible and irresistible; for nothing can resist His will. For even the things which seem to resist, resist only because He is kind, and allows each nature to have its own privilege, and its freedom of will.' </p>                        </div>

I too, says <a href=/people/1351 target=_blank>Nicagoras</a>, in reading his Hellenics and <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>'s, have detected him in transferring many things from <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>; and the mischief is that he has changed them for the worse. <br />'For instance, the account of the conference of <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazus</a> with <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> through the mediation of <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=person long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, and their conversations with each other under a truce, which <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> in his fourth Book recorded very gracefully and in a manner becoming to both, <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> has transferred into the eleventh Book of his Hellenics, and deprived of all vigour, and movement, and effect. <br />'For while, in order to hide his theft, he strives to throw in and to display forcible and elaborate language, he appears slow, and hesitating, and procrastinating, and destroys the animation and vigour of <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a>. <br />'After <a href=/people/1351 target=_blank>Nicagoras</a> had thus spoken, <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said, But what wonder that the vice of plagiarism infected <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> and <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a>, who were merely very dull men, when even <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> was full of this infirmity, though in censuring him <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> the Grammarian, because of his excessive friendship for him, dealt gently in his parallel extracts from him and from those whom he plagiarised. But <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> in six books, which he entitled Of <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>'s Appropriations, exposed the multitude of his plagiarisms. <br />'In the same way <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=person long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> began a treatise On the Plagiarism of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>.

Now I suspect that the one who has stolen is <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a>: but as it is uncertain which it was, I admire <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, if he borrowed from <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> and made appropriate corrections; but I blame <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> if he borrowed from <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, and perverted it for the worse.' </p>                        </div>

For you will find all things among the Greeks to be recent, having come into existence, as one might say, yesterday or the day before; I mean the foundation of their cities, and their invention of the arts, and the registration of their laws: and the writing of their histories is almost the latest object of their attention. <br />'Doubtless, however, they themselves admit that the most ancient and most constant traditional record is that of the events which have occurred among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> (for at present I omit to include ourselves with these). <br />'For they all inhabit regions which are least subject to destruction from the surrounding atmosphere, and have taken much care to leave none of the facts of their history unrecorded, but to have all continually enshrined by their wisest men in public registers. <br />'But the region about Greece has been invaded by thousands of destructive plagues, which blotted out the memory of past events: and as they were always setting up new modes of life, they each of them supposed that their own was the beginning of all. <br />'Tardily and painfully they learned the nature of letters. Those at least who assign the greatest antiquity to their use of them boast of having learned it from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> and <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>. <br />'Nevertheless no one could show any record that is preserved even from that time either in temples or on public monuments: seeing that there has been great doubt and inquiry, whether even those who so many years later went on the expedition to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, made use of writing; and the true opinion is rather that they were ignorant of the use now made of written letters. <br />'In short, there is no undisputed writing found among the Greeks older than <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s poetry: and he was evidently later than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. They say too that even he did not leave his poetry in writing, but that it was transmitted by memory and afterwards put together from the songs, and that this is the cause of its many discrepancies. <br />'Those, however, among them who undertook to write histories — I mean <a href=/people/6310 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> and <a href=/people/1811 target=_blank>Acusilaus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, and any others who are said to have come after him — lived but a short time before the expedition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> against Greece. <br />'Moreover all with one voice acknowledge, that the first among the Greeks who philosophized about things celestial and divine, as <a href=/people/582 target=_blank>Pherecydes</a> the Syrian, and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, and <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a>, got their learning from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>, and wrote but little: and these writings are thought by the Greeks to be the oldest of all, and they do not quite believe that they were written by those authors. <br />'Is it not then necessarily unreasonable for the Greeks to have been puffed up, as though they alone understood the events of early times, and handed down the truth concerning them correctly?

And on many points even <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> is accused by some of falsehood, although he is thought to write the history of his own time with the greatest accuracy. <br />'Now of dissension such as this many other causes might perhaps be brought to light by those who wish to seek for them; but I myself attach the greatest importance to two causes which shall now be set forth. <br />'And I will mention first that which seems to me to be the more decisive. For the fact that from the beginning there was no zealous care among the Greeks to have public records kept of contemporary events — this most of all was the cause of error, and gave impunity for falsehood to those who afterwards wished to write about ancient history. <br />'For not only among the other Greeks was the care of the records neglected, but even among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> themselves, who are said to be aborigines and studious of culture, nothing of this kind is found to have been done: but the oldest of their public records they say are the laws about murder written for them by <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a>, a man born a little before the tyranny of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratos</a>. <br />'What need is there to speak of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a>, who boast of antiquity? For they even at a later period were scarcely instructed in the use of letters. <br />'Inasmuch therefore as no record had been published, which would have taught those who wished to learn, and convicted those who were guilty of falsehood, there ensued the great disagreement of the historians among themselves. <br />'But besides this there is that other second cause to be assigned. For those who set themselves to write made no serious study of the truth — although they have always this profession ready at hand — but tried to display their power of language; and adapted themselves to any style in which they thought to surpass the rest in reputation on this point; and some of them turned to writing mythical tales, and some, to gain favour, took to eulogizing cities or kings; while others had recourse to censuring men's actions or those who had described them, thinking that they should gain reputation herein. <br />'In short they are constantly doing what is of all things the most contrary to history. For it is a test of true history, whether all spake and wrote the same accounts of the same events; but these men imagined that if they wrote different accounts from others, they should thus appear to:be themselves;most truthful of all.' </p>                        </div>

For as <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a> the eldest of them lived about the fiftieth Olympiad, the approximate dates of those who came after him are thus stated concisely. <br />'This is what I have composed for you, O men of Greece, I, <a href=/people/4311 target=_blank>Tatian</a>, a follower of the Barbarians in philosophy, born in the land of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, but instructed first in your doctrines, and afterwards in such as I now profess to preach.

For being a man of great genius, and clever in raising questions upon any and every matter, he brought moral and political speculations into philosophy, and moreover was the first who attempted to define the theory of the Ideas: but while still stirring up every kind of discussion, and inquiring about all subjects, he died too early a death. <br />'Others took certain separate parts and spent their time upon these, some on Medicine, others on the Mathematical Sciences, and some on the poets and <a href=/people/1268 target=_blank>Music</a>.

For some sang the praises of cynical habits, and humility, and insensibility; but others, on the contrary, of pleasures. And some used to boast of knowing all things, and others of knowing absolutely nothing. <br />'Further some used to roll themselves about in public and in the sight of all men, associating with the common people, while others on the contrary could never be approached nor accosted. <br />'<a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> however, though he perceived that the science of things divine and human was one and the same, was the first to make a distinction, asserting that there was one kind of study concerned with the nature of the universe, and another concerned with human affairs, and a third with dialectic. <br />'But he maintained that we could not take a clear view of human affairs, unless the divine were previously discerned: for just as physicians, when treating any parts of the body, attend first to the state of the whole, so the man who is to take a clear view of things here on earth must first know the nature of the universe; and man, he said, was a part of the world; and good was of two kinds, our own good and that of the whole, and the good of the whole was the more important, because the other was for its sake. <br />'Now <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a> the Musician says that this argument comes from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>: for a certain man of that nation fell in with <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and presently asked him, what he was doing in philosophy: and when he said, that he was studying human life, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> laughed at him, and said that no one could comprehend things human, if he were ignorant of things divine. <br />'Whether this, however, is true no one could assert positively: but <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> at all events distinguished the philosophy of the universe, and that of civil polity, and also that of dialectic.' </p>                        </div>

For not only, as <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> used to say, is the death of fire the birth of air, but still more manifestly in our own case the man in his prime perishes when the old man is coming, and the young man has passed away into the man in his prime, and the child into the young man, and the infant into the child, and the man of yesterday has died into the man of today, and the man of today (is dying) into the man of to-morrow; and not one abides nor is one, but we become many, while matter is circulating around some one phantom and common mould, and then slipping away. <br />'Else how is it, if we remain the same, that we delight now in some things, formerly in others, that we love and hate the contrary things, and praise and blame, use different language, have different feelings, retain no more the same appearance, form, or thought? <br />'For neither is it natural to have different feelings without a change, nor can one who changes be the same. But if he is not the same, he is not, but is changing from this, and becoming other from other: and our sense, through ignorance of true being, falsely declares the apparent to be. <br />'What then is true being? The eternal and uncreate, and imperishable, to which no time brings change. For time is something moveable, and imagined in connexion with the movement of matter, and ever flowing and not holding water, as it were a vessel of perishing and becoming. And so when it is said of time after and before, and will be and has been, there is at once an acknowledgement of not-being. <br />'For to say of that which has not yet come into being, or has already ceased from being, that it is is silly and absurd. But at the very moment when, trying to fix our perception of time, we say it is present, it is here, and now, our reason slips away again from this and loses it. For it is thrust aside into the future and into the past, just as a visual ray is distorted with those who try to see what is necessarily separated by distance. <br />'And if the nature which is measured is subject to the same conditions as the time which measures it, this nature itself has no permanence, nor being, but is becoming and perishing according to its relation to time. <br />'Hence nothing of this kind may be said of being, such as was or will be: for these are a kind of inflexions, and transitions, and alternations of that which is not fitted by nature to continue in being. <br />'But we ought to say of God, HE is, and is in relation to no time, but in relation to eternity the motionless, and timeless, and changeless, in which is no before nor after, nor future, nor past, nor elder nor younger: but being One He has filled the Ever with the one Now; and is the sole self-dependent real Being, having neither past nor future, without beginning and without end. <br />'Thus then ought we in worship to salute and address Him, or even indeed as some of the ancients did, THOU ART ONE, For the Deity is not many, as each of us is, a promiscuous assemblage of all kinds compounded of numberless differences arising in its conditions: but being must be One, just as One must be being: for otherness, as a differentia of being, inclines towards a becoming of not-being.' </p>                        </div>

But in the dialogue On the Soul observe how he explains these topics more at length. <br />'May we then, said he, assume two kinds of existing things, one visible and the other invisible? <br />'Let us assume it, said he. <br />'And the invisible constant and immutable, but the visible never constant? <br />'This also let us assume. <br />'Well then, said he, is not the one part of ourselves body, and the other soul? <br />'Exactly so, said he. <br />'To which class then should we say that the body is more like and more akin? <br />'Oh, that is manifest to every one, said he; to the visible. <br />'And what of the soul? Is it visible or invisible? <br />'Not visible at any rate by men, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />'But we surely were speaking of the things that are visible or not visible to the nature of man; or was it, think you, to some other nature? <br />'To man's nature. <br />'What do we say then about the soul? Is it visible or invisible? <br />'Invisible. <br />'Then it is unseen? <br />'Yes. <br />'Soul then is more like the unseen than body is, and body like the visible? <br />'It must certainly be so, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />'Well then, were we not also saying long ago, that whenever the soul uses the help of the body to examine anything, either by sight, or by hearing, or by any other sense (for this is what is meant by the help of the body, to examine a thing by the help of sense), that then she is dragged by the body into the midst of these ever-changing objects, and loses her own way, and becomes confused, and giddy as if drunken, from trying to lay hold of things of this same kind? <br />'Quite so. <br />'But whenever she is contemplating anything by herself alone, she passes at once into yonder world, to the pure, and eternal, and immortal, and unchangeable, and there and with that world she ever communes as one of kindred nature, whenever she can be alone, and have opportunity; and so she has rest from her wandering, and with that world she is constant and unchangeable, as trying to lay hold of things of this same kind. And this condition of the soul is called thoughtfulness. <br />'Very nobly and truly spoken, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, said he. <br />'To which class then does it now seem to you, from both our former and our present arguments, that the soul is more like and more akin? <br />'Every one, I think, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, said he, even the most stupid, would from this method of inquiry agree that soul is in every way much more like to that which is ever constant than to that which is not. <br />'And what of the body? <br />'More like the other. <br />'Look at it then again in this way; that, when soul and body are combined in one, nature orders the body to serve and to obey, and the soul to rule and to govern. Now in these respects again which of the two seems to you to be like the divine, and which like the mortal? Do you not think that the divine is naturally fitted to rule and to lead, and the mortal to be ruled and to serve? <br />'I think so. <br />'To which of the two then is the soul like? <br />'Evidently, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, the soul is like the divine, and the body like the mortal. <br />'Consider then, <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a>, said he, whether from all that has been said we obtain these results: that soul is most like the divine, and immortal, and intelligible, and uniform, and indissoluble, and ever unchangeable and self-consistent; and the body on the other hand most like the human, and mortal, and unintelligible, arid multiform, and dissoluble, and never consistent with itself. <br />'Have we anything else to say against this, my dear <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a>, to show that it is not so? <br />'We have not. <br />'Well then? This being so, is it not a property of body to be quickly dissolved, but of soul on the other hand to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly so? <br />'Certainly. <br />'Do you then observe, that after a man is dead, the body, the part of him which is visible and lies in the visible world, and is called a corpse, the property of which is to be dissolved, and decomposed, and scattered by the winds, does not at once suffer any change of this kind, but remains for a considerable time — if the man die with his body in a vigorous state and at a vigorous time of life, for a very considerable time indeed. For when the body has shrunk and been embalmed, like those who were embalmed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, it remains almost entire an incredible time. And even if the body be decayed, some parts of it, bones and sinews and all such parts, are nevertheless, so to say, immortal, are they not? <br />'Yes. <br />'But then the soul, the unseen, that has passed to another place like herself, noble, and pure, and unseen, the true <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, to the presence of the good and wise God, whither, if it be God's will, my own soul is presently to go — is then, I say, this soul of ours, such as she is and so endowed by nature, on being released from the body, immediately scattered to the winds and lost, as most men say? <br />'Far from it, my dear <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a> and <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a>; but the truth is much rather this. If the soul is pure when released, drawing nothing of the body after her, as she never during this life had any communication with it willingly, but shrank from it, and was gathered up into herself, as making this her constant study, and this is nothing else than practising true philosophy, and preparing in reality to die cheerfully, — Or would not this be a preparation for death? <br />'Certainly. <br />'In this condition then the soul departs to that world which is like herself, the unseen, the divine, and deathless, and wise: and on arriving there she finds ready for her a happy existence, released from error, and folly, and fears, and wild desires, and all other human ills, and, as they say of the initiated, she truly passes the rest of her time with the gods. Is it thus, <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a>, that we ought to speak, or otherwise? <br />'Thus assuredly, said <a href=/people/521 target=_blank>Cebes</a>. <br />'But, I suppose, if when she departs from the body she is polluted and impure, from being in constant communion with the body, and cherishing it, and loving it, and having been so bewitched by it, I mean by its desires and pleasures, as to think that nothing else is true except the corporeal, just what a man might touch, and see, and eat, and drink, and use for his lusts — but accustomed to hate and fear and shun what to the eyes is dark and invisible, but intelligible to thought and attainable by philosophy — in this condition then do you suppose that a soui will depart pure in herself and unalloyed? <br />'By no means, said he.' </p>                        </div>

For if she is like that which is divine, and immortal, and invisible, and inseparable, and indissoluble, and essential, and firmly established in incorruption, how can she fail to be of the corresponding class to the pattern? <br />'For whenever there are two extremes manifestly contrary, as rational and irrational, and it is a question to which side some third thing belongs, this is one mode of proof, by showing to which of the opposites it is like. For thus, although the human race in the first stage of life is held down in an irrational condition, and although many even to old age are full of the errors of unreason, nevertheless, because it has many similarities to that which is purely rational, this race was believed to be from the beginning rational. <br />'Since therefore there is a divine constitution manifestly incapable of admixture and of damage, namely that of the gods, and since there is evidently on the other hand the earthly, and soluble, subject to corruption, and since with some it is doubted to which side of the said opposition the soul is attached, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s opinion was that we should trace out the truth from similarity. <br />'And since she is in no way like to the mortal and soluble and irrational and inanimate, which is therefore also tangible, and sensible, and becoming, and perishing, but like the divine, and immortal, and invisible, and intelligent, which partakes of life, and is akin to truth, and has all the properties which he enumerates as belonging to her, — since this is so, he thought it not right, while granting that she had the other points of likeness to God, to consent to deny her the similarity of essence, which is the cause of her having received these very properties. <br />'For as the things which were in their operations unlike God were at once found to differ also in the constitution of their essence, so he thought it followed, that the things which partook in a measure of the same operations had previously possessed the similarity of essence. For because of the quality of the essence the operations also were of a certain quality, as flowing from it, and being offshoots of it.' </p>                        </div>

And this retrogression has of necessity been implanted in its nature for the following reason. <br />'For what reason, pray? <br />'Because it is a property of none but the most divine things to be always changeless in condition and self-consistent and the same, and bodily nature is not of this class. And though that which we have called the heaven and the world has been endowed by its Creator with many blessings, nevertheless it also partakes of body; whence it is impossible for it to be always free from change; as far as possible however, and in a very great degree, it moves in the same orbit in one and the same relative course, because the reversal to which it is subject is the least possible alteration of its proper motion. <br />'But it is almost impossible for anything to continue for ever turning itself, except for the Ruler of all things that are moved. And for Him to move anything now one way, and now again in the opposite way, would not be right. From all this then we must neither say that the world always turns itself, nor that it is all turned by God in two opposite courses, nor again that some two gods, who are of opposite minds, turn it, but, as was said just now, and this alone remains possible, that at one time it is guided in its course by another divine cause, acquiring again its life, and receiving from its Creator a restored immortality, and at another time when let go it moves of itself, having been let go at such a time that it travels backwards during countless periods, because being of vast size and most perfectly balanced it moves upon the smallest pivot. <br />'Certainly all the details which you have described seem to be very probable. <br />'Let us then draw our conclusions and consider closely the effect produced from what I have just mentioned, which effect we said was the cause of all the wonders: for surely it is this very thing. <br />'What thing? <br />'The fact that the course of the world at one time is guided in the direction of its present revolution, and at another time in the opposite direction. <br />'How then? <br />'This change we must believe to be the greatest and most complete of all variations in the heavenly motions. <br />'It seems so indeed. <br />'We must suppose therefore that very great changes occur at that time to us who dwell under the heaven. <br />'This too is probable. <br />'But do we not know that animal nature ill endures many great and various changes occurring at the same time? <br />'Of course. <br />'Very great destruction therefore of all other animals necessarily occurs at that time, and moreover very little of the human race survives. And with regard to these survivors, among many other marvellous and strange effects which occur the greatest is this, which also follows immediately upon the reversal of the motion of the universe at the time when the revolution opposite to that which is at present established takes place.' </p>                        </div>

But the fact is the same, that from weakness and sluggishness we are not able to pass out to the surface of the air: for if any one were to reach the top of it, or take wings and fly up to it. he would put out his head, and, just as the fishes here who jump up out of the water and see the objects on earth, so would a man survey the world beyond: and, if his nature were strong enough to endure the sight, he would learn that yonder is the true heaven, and the true light, and the true earth. <br />'For this earth and the stones and the whole region here are decayed and corroded, as the things in the sea by the brine: and there is nothing worth mentioning that grows in the sea, nor anything that is, so to say, perfect; but there are caves, and sand, and vast slime and mud-banks wherever there is land, all utterly unworthy to be compared with the beautiful things of our world. <br />'But on the other hand yonder world would be seen far more to surpass everything of ours. For if I must tell you a pretty fable, it is worth your while, <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a>, to hear what is the nature of the objects on that earth which lie close under the heaven. <br />'We certainly, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, said <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a>, should be delighted to hear this fable. <br />'Well then, my friend, said he, it is said in the first place that the earth itself, if any one were to see it from above, is just such to look upon as the balls which are covered with twelve pieces of leather, variegated and marked by different colours, of which the colours used by our painters here on earth are, as it were, samples. But there the earth is wholly made up of colours such as these, and far more brilliant and pure. <br />'For part of it is purple and of marvellous beauty, and part like gold, and the part that is white is whiter than chalk or snow, and in like manner it is made up of all the other colours, and yet more in number and more beautiful than all that we have ever seen. <br />'For even these mere hollows of it, filled as they are with water and air, present a certain species of colour, as they gleam amid the diversity of the other colours, so that its form appears as one continuous variegated surface. <br />'And in this earth such as I have described it, the plants that grow are in like proportion, both trees and flowers, with their fruits; and the mountains again in like manner, and the stones have their smoothness and transparency greater in the same proportion, and their colours more beautiful: and of these the gems here, these that are so prized, are fragments, carnelians, and jaspers, and emeralds, and all such as these: but there everything without exception is of this kind, and still more beautiful than these. <br />'And the cause of this is that those stones are pure, and not eaten away or spoiled, like those here, by decay and brine, and by the sediments collected here, which cause ugliness and diseases in stones and earth, and in animals and plants as well. But the real earth is adorned with all these jewels, and with gold and silver besides, and all other things such as these. For they shine out on the surface, being many in number and of great size and in many places of the earth, so that to see it must be a sight for the blessed to behold.' </p>                        </div>

Do you not think so? Yes, I do, said he: but I do not even understand which you call the greater. Those, said I, which <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and the other poets used to tell us. For they, I suppose, used to compose and tell, and do still tell, false stories to mankind. <br />'What kind of stories do you mean, said he, and what fault do you find with them? <br />'The fault, said I, which before and above all we ought to reprove, especially if the falsehood is unseemly. <br />'What is this fault? <br />'When a man in his discourse concerning gods and heroes misrepresents their nature, as when an artist paints what is not at all like the things which he may wish to imitate. <br />'Yes indeed, said he, it is right to condemn such things: but how. and what kind of faults do we mean? <br />'In the first place then, said I, it was an unseemly lie that was told by the author of that greatest fiction about the greatest gods, how <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Uranus</a> wrought what <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says he did, and how <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> took revenge upon him. Again, the doings of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> and his treatment by his son, even if they were true, ought not, I should have thought, to have been thus lightly mentioned before young and silly persons, but, best of all, to have been buried in silence; or, if there were any necessity to tell them, then as few as possible should have heard them in secret, after sacrificing no mere <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a>, but some great and scarce victim, so that very few might have had a chance of hearing them. <br />'Yes indeed, said he, these stories are mischievous. Aye, said I, and they must not be told in our city, <a href=/people/1361 target=_blank>Adeimantus</a>; nor must a young hearer be told, that he would be doing nothing extraordinary in committing the worst crimes, nor on the other hand in inflicting every kind of punishment upon his father if he did wrong, but would be doing what the first and greatest of the gods did. <br />'Certainly not, nor in my own opinion are such stories fit to be told. <br />'Nor yet, said I, about gods going to war with gods, and plotting against each other and fighting (untrue as such things are), ought anything to be said, if the future guardians of our city are to think it most disgraceful to be quarrelling lightly one with another. Far less ought we to tell them in fables and on tapestry about wars of the giants and many other quarrels of all kinds between gods and heroes and their own kinsmen and relations: but if we could in any way persuade them, that no citizen was ever at enmity with a fellow citizen, and that such a thing was unholy, these are the kind of tales that ought rather to be told to children from the first by old men and old women and by those who are growing elderly, and the poets should be compelled to make their tales like these. <br />'The chaining too of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> by her son, and the hurling of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> out of heaven by his father, when he was going to defend his mother from a beating, and all the battles of the gods that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has invented, must not be admitted into the city, whether they are composed with or without allegorical meanings. <br />'For the youth is not able to judge what is allegory and what is not: but whatever opinions he accepts at such an age are wont to become indelible and unalterable: and on this account perhaps we ought to regard it of the highest importance, that the tales which they first hear should be adapted in the most perfect manner to the promotion of virtue. <br />'Yes, that is reasonable, said he: but if any one were to ask us again which these fictions are, and what fables we mean, which should we mention? Then said I: My dear <a href=/people/1361 target=_blank>Adeimantus</a>, you and I are not speaking at present as poets, but as founders of a state: and founders of a state ought to know the moulds in which poets should cast their fictions, and from which they must not be permitted to deviate, nor must they invent the fables themselves. <br />'Quite right, said he: but that is the very point, what would be the proper models in the case of theology? <br />'Some such as the following, said I; God must of course always be represented as He really is, whether a poet describes Him in epic verse, or in lyrics, or in tragedy. <br />'Yes, that must be so. <br />'Is not God then really good, and to be so described? <br />'Of course. <br />'But surely nothing good is hurtful? Is it? <br />'I think not. <br />'Does then that which is not hurtful do hurt? <br />'Of course not. <br />'And does that which hurts not, do any evil? <br />'No, again. <br />'Neither can that which does no evil be the cause of any evil? <br />'How could it? <br />'Well then, is the good beneficial? <br />'Yes. <br />'It is the cause then of well-being? <br />'Yes. <br />'The good then is not the cause of all things, but only of what is right, and not the cause of evils. <br />'Quite so, said he. <br />'Neither then, said I, can God, since He is good, be the cause of all things, as the many say, but of few things that happen to men He is the cause, and of many things He is not the cause: for our good things are far fewer than the evil. And of the good we must assign no other cause than God, but of the evil we must seek the causes in other things, but not in God. <br />'I think, said he, you speak most truly. <br />'We must not then, said I, allow either <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> or any other poet foolishly to commit such an offence as this against the gods, and to say that <br /> Two coffers lie beside the door of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, <br />With gifts for man; one good, the other ill. <br />'And to whom <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> give a mixture of the two, <br />Him sometimes evil, sometimes good befalls; <br />'And to whom he gives no mixture, but the ill alone, <br />Him ravenous hunger o'er God's earth pursues. <br />'Nor must we admit that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is to us <br />The sole dispenser both of weal and woe. <br />'And if any one say that the violation of oaths and treaties wrought by <a href=/people/1635 target=_blank>Pandarus</a> was brought about by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, we shall not approve: nor that the strife and contest of the gods was caused by <a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>: nor again must we permit our young men to hear how <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a> says that <br /> God plants in mortal breasts the cause of sin, <br />When He would utterly destroy a house. <br />'But if any one writes a poem, in which these iambics are found, about the sorrows of <a href=/people/479 target=_blank>Niobe</a>, or the calamities of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a>' line, or the tale of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, or any other such events, either we must forbid him to call them the work of a god, or, if of a god, then he must invent some such explanation for them as we are now seeking, and must say that God did what was just and good, and the others were the better for being chastised. But we must not permit the poet to say that those who suffered punishment were miserable, and that this was God's doing. <br />'If, however, they would say that the wicked were miserable because they needed punishment, but were benefited by being punished by God, that we must approve. <br />'But as to saying that God, who is good, becomes the author of evil to any, we must by all possible means contend that no one shall make such statements in his own city, if it is to be governed by good laws, nor any one either young or old listen to his tales whether in verse or prose, as such statements if tittered would be impious, and neither profitable to us, nor consistent with themselves. <br />'I vote with you, said he, for this law, and am pleased with it. <br />'This then, said I, will be one of the laws and moulds in which our speakers must speak concerning God, and our poets write, That God is not the cause of all things, but only of the good. <br />'That is quite satisfactory, said he. <br />'And what then of this second? Do you suppose God to be a sorcerer, and of a nature to show Himself craftily now in one form and now in another, at one time actually becoming what He seems, and changing His own proper form into various shapes, and at another deceiving us, and making us imagine such transformations in Him; or do you think that He is a simple essence, and most unlikely to go out of His own proper form? <br />'I am not able, said he, to answer now off-hand. <br />'Well, what do you say to this? If anything were to change from its own proper form, must it not be changed either by itself or by some other? <br />'It must. <br />'Are not then the things which are in the best condition least liable to be altered or moved by another? As for example when a body is affected by meats and drinks and labours, and every plant by sunshine and winds and other such influences, is it not the healthiest and the most perfect that is altered least? <br />'Of course it is. <br />'And would not the bravest and wisest soul be least disturbed and altered by any influence from without? <br />'Yes. <br />'Moreover I suppose that, on the same principle, among all manufactured things, furniture, buildings, and clothes, those that are well made and in good condition suffer the least alteration from time and other influences? <br />'It is so. <br />'Everything then which is well constituted either by nature or art, or both, admits the least alteration by any other? <br />'So it seems. <br />'But surely God, and the things of God, are in every way most excellent? <br />'Of course. <br />'In this way then God is most unlikely to take many shapes. <br />'Most unlikely indeed. <br />'But would He change and alter Himself? <br />'Evidently, said he, if He is changed at all. <br />'Does He then change Himself into what is better and more beautiful, or into what is worse and less beautiful than Himself? <br />'It must be into what is worse than Himself, if He is changed at all: for surely we shall not say that God is imperfect in beauty or goodness. <br />'You are quite right, said I. And this being so, do you think, <a href=/people/1361 target=_blank>Adeimantus</a>, that any one, whether god or man, would willingly make himself worse in any way? <br />'Impossible, said he. <br />'It is also impossible then, said I, that a god should be willing to change himself, but each one of them, as it seems, being as perfect as possible in beauty and goodness, remains ever absolutely in his own form. <br />'It seems to me quite certain, said he. <br />'Then, my good friend, said I, let none of the poets tell us that <br /> Gods, in the guise of strangers from afar, <br />Wander in various forms from state to state. <br />'Nor let any one slander <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> and <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, nor introduce <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> in tragedies nor in any other poems transformed as a priestess begging alms <br />For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228WIna class=place long=22.744 lat=37.625>Inachus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> river-god's <br />Life-giving daughters. <br />'These and many other such falsehoods let them cease to invent. Neither let our mothers be persuaded by these poets to terrify their children by the tales which they wickedly tell them, that certain gods forsooth wander about by night in the likeness of many animals of different kinds, lest they be both guilty of blasphemy against the gods, and at the same time make their children more cowardly. <br />'Let them beware, said he. <br />'But then, said I, do the gods, though they are not capable of actual change, make us imagine, by their deception and magic, that they appear in various forms? <br />'Perhaps, said he. <br />'Well then, said I, would a god be willing to lie either by word or by deed, in putting phantoms before us? <br />'I do not know, said he. <br />'Do you not know, said I, that the true lie, if one may so speak, is hated by all both gods and men? <br />'How do you mean? said he. <br />'You know, of course, said I, that no one willingly consents to lie to the highest and chiefest part of himself, and concerning matters of the highest importance, but every one fears above all to harbour a lie there. <br />'No, I do not even now understand you, said he. <br />'Because, said I, you think I have some grand meaning: but I only mean that to lie to the soul about realities, and to be deceived and ignorant, and to have and to hold the falsehood there, is what all men would most dislike, and what in that part of them they utterly detest. <br />'Yes, utterly, said he. <br />'But surely, as I was saying just now, this is what might most rightly be called a true lie, this ignorance in the soul of the deceived: since the lie in words is a sort of imitation of the affection in the soul, and an image produced afterwards, not at all a pure unmixed lie. Is it not so? <br />'Yes, certainly. <br />'The real lie then is hated not only by gods, but also by men? <br />'I think so. <br />'Well then? When and in what case is the lie in words useful, and so not deserving to be hated? Is it not in dealing with enemies, and when any of those who are called our friends from madness or any kind of folly attempt to do some mischief, it then becomes useful as a remedy to turn them from their purpose? <br />'Also in those mythical tales of which we were speaking just now, because we know not how the truth stands about ancient events, do we not make the falsehood as much like truth as possible, and so make it useful? <br />'It certainly is so, said he. <br />'For which of these reasons then is falsehood useful to God? Would He lie from ignorance of ancient events by trying to make them like the truth? <br />'Nay, that would be ridiculous. <br />'There is nothing of the lying poet then in God? <br />'I think not. <br />'But would He lie through fear of His enemies? <br />'Far from it. <br />'Or because His friends are foolish or mad? <br />'Nay, said he, no fool or madman is a friend of God. <br />'There is no motive then for a god to lie? <br />'There is none. <br />'The nature then of gods and demi-gods is quite incapable of falsehood? <br />'Yes, utterly so. <br />'God then is perfectly simple and true both in deed and word, and neither changes in Himself, nor deceives others, either in apparitions, or by words, or by sending signs, either in dream or waking vision. <br />'I too think it is just as you say. <br />'You agree then, said I, that this is a second mould in which speech or poetry about the gods must be cast, that they neither are wizards who transform themselves nor mislead us by falsehoods either in word or in deed? <br />'I do agree. <br />'While therefore we commend many other things in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, we shall not commend this, the sending of the dream by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> to <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>; nor the passage of <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, in which <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> says that <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, singing at her marriage, <br />Dwelt on my happy motherhood, <br />The life from sickness free and lengthened years; <br />Then all-inclusively he blest my lot, <br />Favoured of heaven, in strains that cheered my soul. </p>                        </div>

Should we in the first place take up again this argument which you urge, I mean that concerning men's opinions, whether it was in every case a right statement or not, that we ought to pay attention to some opinions, and not to others? Or whether the statement was right before I was condemned to die, but now has been manifestly proved to have been urged just for the sake of arguing, while it was in reality mere jesting and trifling? <br />'My own desire then is to consider with your help, <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a>, whether the argument will appear to me to be in anyway altered, now that I am. in this position, or still the same; and whether we shall renounce it or act according to it.

And whither does it tend, and to what part of the disobedient person? <br />'Evidently to the body, for it does harm to this. <br />'You are right.

Moreover, in regard to what things are just and unjust, and disgraceful and honourable, and good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation, must we follow the opinion of the many and fear it, or that of the one, if there is a man of understanding, whom we ought to reverence and fear more than all the rest together? And if we fail to follow him we shall corrupt and ruin that part of us which, as we said, is improved by justice and degraded by injustice. Or is that part of no importance? <br />'I think it is important, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />'Well then, if we ruin that part of us, which is improved by what is healthful and damaged by what is unwholesome, by not yielding to the opinion of those who have understanding, is our life worth living when that is ruined? Now this part, I suppose, is the body, is it not? <br />'Yes. <br />'Is our life then worth living with a wretched and diseased body? <br />'By no means. <br />'But is then life tolerable for us with that part of us diseased which is damaged by injustice and improved by justice? Or do we believe that part of us, whatever it is, which is concerned with injustice and justice to be more worthless than the body? <br />'By no means. <br />'More precious then? <br />'By far. <br />'Then, my good friend, we must not care thus at all what the many will say of us, but what the man who understands about justice and injustice will say, the one man, and the very truth.

For to be afraid to die, Sirs, is nothing else than to think oneself to be wise, when one is not: for it is to think that one knows, what one does not know. For no one knows about death even whether it may not be the greatest of all blessings to man; but they fear it as if they certainly knew that it is the greatest of evils. And what is this but that same disgraceful ignorance, for a man to think that he knows what he does not know? <br />'But I, Sirs, perhaps on this subject also differ from most men in this; and were I to say that I am wiser than another in any respect, it would be in this, that, as I do not know enough about the state of things in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, so I also think that I do not know.

For the state of the dead is one of two things: either it is like non-existence and absence of all sensation in the dead, or, as is commonly said, it is a sort of transference and migration of the soul from this region to another. And if there is no sensation, but as it were a sleep in which the sleeper sees nothing even in a dream, death must be a wonderful gain. <br />'For I suppose, that if a man were obliged to select the night in which he slept so soundly as to see nothing even in a dream, and to compare all the other nights and days of his life with this night, — if, I say, he were obliged to consider and tell us how many days and nights in the course of his life he had passed more happily and more pleasantly than this night, I think that not merely any ordinary person but even the great King himself would find these better nights very few in comparison with all the rest of his days and nights. If therefore death is something of this kind, I call it a gain: for thus all time appears nothing more than a single night. <br />'But if on the other hand death is like a departure hence to another place, and if what is said is true, that all the dead exist there, what greater good could there be than this, O my judges? For if on arriving in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, after having been delivered from the self-styled judges here, a man shall find the true judges, who are said to give judgement there, <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, and <a href=/people/718 target=_blank>Rhadamanthus</a>, and <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>, and <a href=/people/702 target=_blank>Triptolemus</a>, and all the other demi-gods who were just in their own lives, will the change of abode be worth nothing? <br />'Or on the contrary, what would any of you pay to associate with <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, and <a href=/people/905 target=_blank>Musaeus</a>, and <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>? For my part I am willing to die many a death, if indeed these things are true, since I too should find it a delightful occupation there, whenever I met with <a href=/people/302 target=_blank>Palamedes</a>, and <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> the son of <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a>, and any other of the ancients who has died through an unjust judgement, to compare my own sufferings with theirs, — no unpleasant thing, methinks it would he. And moreover the chief delight would be to spend my life in examining and scrutinizing the dwellers in that world, as I do those here, to learn which of them is wise, and which, though he thinks so, is not.' </p>                        </div>

Moreover, <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, in verses taken from his writings in the Sacred Legend, thus sets forth the doctrine that all things are governed by divine power, and that they have had a beginning, and that God is over all.

And it has been said by some who were of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> School that wisdom is in place of a beacon-light, for by following it constantly men will be rendered free from trouble through their whole life. <br />'But more clearly and more beautifully one of our forefathers, <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, said that it has existed before heaven and earth; which indeed agrees with what has been said above. But what is clearly stated by the Law, that God rested on the seventh day, means not, as some suppose, that God henceforth ceases to do anything, but it refers to the fact that, after He has brought the arrangement of His works to completion, He has arranged them thus for all time. <br />'For it points out that in six days He made the heaven and the earth and all things that are therein, to distinguish the times, and predict the order in which one thing comes before another: for after arranging their order, He keeps them so, and makes no change. He has also plainly declared that the seventh day is ordained for us by the Law, to be a sign of that which is our seventh faculty, namely reason, whereby we have knowledge of things human and divine. <br />'Also the whole world of living creatures, and of all plants that grow, revolves in sevens.

In fact, the interposition of chance occurred to <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> from having misunderstood the language of the following passage: Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. To <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> it occurred to bring Providence down only so far as to the moon, from this Psalm: Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heaven, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. For before the coming of the Lord the meaning of the prophetic mysteries was not as yet revealed. <br />'Again the chastisements after death and the punishment by fire were stolen from our Barbarian philosophy both by every <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> of poetry and even by the Greek philosophy. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, for instance, in the last Book of the Republic says in. express terms: Hereupon certain fierce men of fiery aspect, who were standing by and understood the sound, seized and led away some of them separately; But <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a> and the rest they bound hand and foot and head together, and threw them down, and flayed them, and dragged them along the road outside, carding them like wool on thorns. For his fiery men are meant to indicate angels, who seize the unrighteous and punish them. Who maketh, says the Scripture, His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. <br />'Now it follows upon this that the soul is immortal. For that which is undergoing punishment or correction being in a state of sensation, must be living, though it be said to suffer. Again, does not <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> know also rivers of fire, and the deep of the earth, called by the Barbarians <a href=/people/6500 target=_blank>Gehenna</a>, which he calls poetically <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>, and introduces <a href=/people/1315 target=_blank>Cocytus</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392205WAch class=place long=20.4831 lat=39.2348>Acheron</a>, and <a href=/people/2774 target=_blank>Phlegethon</a>, and names of this kind, as places of punishment for correctional training? And representing, according to the Scripture, the angels of the least of the little ones which behold the face of God, and also His supervision extended to us through the angels set over us, he does not hesitate to write: <br />'After all the souls have chosen their lives, according to their lot, they went forward in order to <a href=/people/1920 target=_blank>Lachesis</a>, and she sent with each the genius of his choice, to be the guardian of his life, and the fulfiller of his chosen destiny. <br />'Perhaps also something of this kind was intimated to <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> by his daemon. <br />'Nay more, the philosophers borrowed, from <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> their doctrine that the world was created, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has said expressly: <br />' Was it that the world had no beginning of creation, or has it been created at first from some beginning? For it is visible, and tangible, and has a body. <br />'And again, when he says: To find therefore the Maker and Father of this universe is a hard task, he not only shows that the world has been generated, but also indicates that it was generated from Him, as from one alone, and sprang up out of non-existence. The <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> also suppose that the world has been created. <br />'The devil too, so often mentioned by the Barbarian philosophy, the prince of the daemons, is described by <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in the tenth Book of the Laws, as being a malignant soul, in the following words: As then a soul directs and inhabits all things that move in every direction, must we not say that it also directs the heaven? <br />' Of course. <br />' One soul or more? More, I will answer for both of you. Less than two surely we must not suppose, one that does good, and the other that has power to work evil. <br />'In like manner also he writes in the <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a> thus: There are indeed other evils, but with most of them some daemon has mingled an immediate pleasure. And further in the tenth Book of the Laws be directly expresses that thought of the Apostle: Our wrestling is not against blood and flesh, . . . but against the spiritual powers of the hosts in heaven, when he writes thus: <br />' For since we agreed among ourselves that the heaven is full of many goods, and full also of evils, and of more evils than goods, such a conflict as this, we say, is immortal, and requires wonderful caution. <br />'Again, the Barbarian philosophy knows one intelligible world, and another sensible, the one an archetype, and the other an image of that fair model; and the former it ascribes to unity, as being perceptible to thought only, but the sensible to the number six: for among the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> six is called marriage, as being a generative number. And in the unity it sets an invisible heaven, and a holy earth, and intelligible light. For In the beginning, says the Scripture, God created the heaven and the earth: and the earth was invisible. Then it adds, And God said, Let there be light, and there was light. But in the creation of the sensible world He framed a solid heaven (and what is solid is sensible), and a visible earth, and a light that is seen. Do you not think that from this passage <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was led to leave the ideas of living things in the intelligible world, and to create the sensible forms according to the various kinds of that intelligible world? <br />'With good reason, therefore, <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> says that the body was formed of earth, what <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> calls an earthly tabernacle, but that the reasonable soul was breathed by God from, on high into man's face: for they say that the ruling faculty is seated in this part, and interpret thus the accessory entrance of the soul through the organs of sense in the first-formed man; for which reason also man, they say, is made after the image and likeness of God. <br />'For the image of God is the divine and royal Word, the impassible man; and an image of that image is the human mind. But if you will admit another name for the growing likeness, you will find it called in <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> a following of God: for he says, Walk after the LORD your God, . . . and keep His commandments. And all the virtuous are, I suppose, followers and servants of God. <br />'Hence the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> have said that the end of philosophy is to live according to the guidance of nature, while <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says it is to become like God, as we showed in the second Miscellany; and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> having received it from <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and he from the Barbarian philosophy, says that all good men are friends one of another. For in the <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a> <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> says that <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> has not ordained that the wicked should be a friend to the wicked; nor the good fail to be a friend to the good. <br />'This he also fully showed in the <a href=/people/1074 target=_blank>Lysis</a>, that friendship can never be preserved amid injustice and wickedness. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> Stranger too says in like manner, That it is conduct pleasing to God and like Him, and has one ancient saying in its favour, when 'like loves like' if it be in measure, but things beyond measure agree neither with things beyond nor with things within measure. And God must be to us the measure of all things. <br />'Then lower down <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> adds again: <br />' For indeed every good man is like every other good man, and consequently being also like God, he is beloved both by every good man and by God. Arrived at this point, I am reminded of the following passage, for at the end of the <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> he says that one should assimilate that which perceives to that which is perceived, according to its original nature, and by thus assimilating them attain the end of that life which is proposed by the gods to men as the best both for the present time and for that which is to follow. </p>                        </div>

For perhaps he is prophesying of that elect nature which desires knowledge; unless in assuming three natures he, as some supposed, is describing three forms of polity, that of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> silver, that of the Greeks the third, and that of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> in whom there has been infused the royal gold, the Holy Spirit. <br />'Also he exhibits the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> life when writing word for word in the <a href=/people/1854 target=_blank>Theaetetus</a>: <br />Let us speak then of the leaders; for why should one talk about those who spend their time to no good purpose in philosophy? But these leaders, I suppose, neither know the way to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, nor where the court of justice is, or the council-chamber, or any other public assembly of the State; and laws, and decrees whether read or written, they neither see nor hear. The strivings of political clubs, and meetings, to obtain offices, and revellings with flute-girls are practices which do not occur to them even in dreams. And what has happened well or ill in the city, or what evil has come to any one from his ancestors, is less known to them than, as the proverb says, the number of gallons in the sea. As to all these things he knows not even that he does not know them: for in fact it is his body only that has its place and home in the city, but the man himself 'is flying,' as <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> says,'underneath the earth' and above the heaven, studying the stars, and scrutinizing every nature on all sides. <br />'Again, with the Lord's saying, Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, we must compare this: But it is by no means right for me to admit a falsehood, and to suppress a truth. Also with the prohibition of swearing agrees this saying in the tenth Book of the Laws: Let there be no praising nor swearing about anything. And to speak generally, <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, when they say that they hear God's voice, while carefully contemplating the constitution of the universe as made by God and held together without interruption, must have heard <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> say, in describing the word of God as a deed, He spake, and it was done. <br />'Also taking their stand upon the formation of the man out of dust, the philosophers on every occasion proclaim that the body is of earth, and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> does not shrink from putting it in the light of a curse: <br /> But may all ye to earth and water turn. </p>                        </div>

So that also when he says, Around the King of all are all things, and for His sake they all are, and that is the cause of all things beautiful; and around a Second are the secondary things, and around a Third the tertiary, I understand it in no other way than that the Holy Trinity is signified. For I think that the Holy Spirit is the third, and the Son the second, by whom all things were made according to the will of the Father. <br />'The same author, in the tenth Book of the Republic, mentions Er, the son of <a href=/people/3141 target=_blank>Armenius</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=person long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylian</a> by birth, who is <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a>. At least <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a> himself writes, <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a> the son of <a href=/people/3141 target=_blank>Armenius</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=person long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylian</a> by birth, having been slain in war, writes down here all things which when in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> I learned from the gods. Now <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says that this <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a> when laid upon the funeral pile on the twelfth day after death came to life again. Perhaps he alludes not to the resurrection, but to the circumstance that the way for souls to their reception above is through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> himself says that their way of return to birth is the same. In this way we must understand also that the labours of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> were said to be twelve, after which the soul obtains its release from this world entirely. <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> also I do not pass over, who mentions the restitution of all things in merely physical language, saying that there will at some time be a change into the essence of fire. <br />'And most plainly is <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=person long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> of this opinion, who maintained that there is one world eternal, and another that perishes, namely, the world in its orderly arrangement, which he knew to be no other than a certain condition of the former. But that he knew the world, which consisting of all being is eternally of a certain quality, to be eternal, he makes evident in speaking thus: <br /> The world which is the same for all was made neither by any god nor man, but always was, and is, and shall be, an everliving fire, kindled in measure, and in measure extinguished. <br />'His doctrine was that the world was created and perishable, as is shown by what he adds: The transmutations of fire are first sea, and of sea one half becomes earth and the other half lightning. For virtually he says, that by God the Word, who administers the universe, fire is changed through air into moisture, the seed as it were of the cosmical arrangement; and this moisture he calls sea. And out of this again heaven and earth arise, and all things therein contained. <br />'How the world is again taken back into the primitive essence, and destroyed by fire, he clearly shows in these words: The sea is spread abroad, and is measured to the same proportion as it was before it became earth. In like manner concerning the other elements the same is to be understood. <br />'Doctrines similar to this are taught also by the most celebrated of the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> in their discussions concerning a conflagration and re-arrangement of the world's order, and concerning both the world and man in their proper quality, and the continuance of our souls. Again, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in the seventh Book of the Republic has called our day here a darkness visible, because, I suppose, of the world-rulers of this darkness; and the soul's entrance into the body he has called sleep and death, in the same manner as <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a>. And is this, perhaps, what the Holy Spirit, speaking by <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>, foretold concerning our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>: I laid me down and slept: I awaked, for the LORD will sustain me. For he figuratively calls not only the Resurrection of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> an awaking from sleep, but also the Lord's coming down into flesh a sleep. <br />'For instance, the same <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> gives the exhortation Watch, as much as to say, study to live, and try to keep the soul independent of the body. Also in the tenth Book of the Republic, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> speaks prophetically of the Lord's day in these words: <br />But when those in the meadow had each been there seven days, they were obliged on the eighth to arise thence and proceed on their journey, and arrive on the fourth day. <br />'By the meadow, therefore, we must understand the fixed sphere, as a quiet and pleasant place, and an abode of the saints; and by the seven days, each motion of the seven planets, and the whole effective device which speeds them to their final rest. The journey after passing the planets leads to heaven, that is to the eighth motion and eighth day; and when he says that the souls are four days on the journey, he indicates their passage through the four elements. <br />'Moreover, the Greeks as well as the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> recognize the holiness of the seventh day, by which the cycle of the whole world of animals and plants is regulated. <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, for instance, speaks of it thus: <br />The first, the fourth, the seventh a holy day. <br />'And again: <br />And on the seventh again the sun shines bright. <br />'<a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> too: <br /> And soon the seventh returned, a holy day. <br />'And again: <br />The seventh day was holy. <br />'And again: </p>                        </div>

Neither, indeed, does the sun, which appears to shine on all, seem to allow himself to be seen: but if any one gazes impudently upon him, he is deprived of sight. The <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a> had said before: <br />What flesh can e'er behold with mortal eyes <br />The immortal God, who dwells above the skies? <br />Or who of mortal birth can stand and gaze <br />With eyes unshrinking on the sun's fierce rays? <br />'Rightly, therefore, does also <a href=/people/671 target=_blank>Xenophanes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a>, when teaching that God is one and incorporeal, add this: <br /> One God there is, supreme o'er gods and men, <br />Not like in form to mortals, nor in mind. <br />'And again: <br /> But mortals fondly deem that gods are born, <br />Have voice, and form, and raiment like their own. <br />'And again: <br />If then the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> had but hands <br />To paint and model works of art, like man, <br />The <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> would give his god an oxlike shape, <br />The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> a figure like his own would frame, <br />And each would deify his kindred form. <br />'Again, then, let us listen to <a href=/people/1587 target=_blank>Bacchylides</a>, the lyric poet, when he says concerning the divine nature: <br /> No taint of foul disease can them assail, <br />No bane annoy, unlike in all to man. <br />'Hear also <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a>, the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, who has written as follows in a certain poem concerning the Deity: <br />Askest thou what good is? List then to me. <br />Good is well ordered, holy, just, devout, <br />Self-mastering, useful, honourable, right, <br />Grave, self-dependent, ever full of help, <br />Unmoved by fear, by sorrow, and by pain, <br />Beneficent, well pleasing, friendly, safe, <br />Of good report, acknowledged, and esteemed, <br />Free from vainglory, careful, gentle, strong, <br />Deliberate, blameless, during to the end. <br />'The same author, tacitly accusing the idolatry of the multitude, adds this: <br />Poor slave is he who to opinion looks, <br />In hope, forsooth, some honour thence to gain. <br />'We must not, therefore, any longer think of the divine nature according to the opinion of the multitude: for, as <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a> says in the <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>: <br /> Never can I believe that secretly, <br />Disguised in fashion of some wicked knave, <br /><a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> visited thy bed in human form. <br />'But <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> writes in straightforward language: <br /> For this man's mother was by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> espoused, <br />Not in a shower of gold, nor in disguise <br />Of feathered swan, as when he pregnant made <br />Fair <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a>, but complete in manly form. <br />'Then farther down he added: <br />Swiftly then the adulterer <br />Upon the bridal chamber's threshold stood. <br />'After which he still more openly describes the incontinence of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> as represented in the fable, in the following manner: <br />Then he nor feast, nor lustral water touched, <br />But hastened to the couch, with heart deep stung <br />By lust, and wantoned there that whole night through. <br />'Let these things, however, he left to the follies of the theatres. <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> expressly says: Men are found incapable of understanding the reason of what is right on each occasion, both before they have heard it, and on hearing it for the first time. <br />'And <a href=/people/3045 target=_blank>Melanippides</a>, the lyric poet, sings thus: <br /> Hear me, O Father, man's delight, <br />Thou ruler of the undying soul. <br />'<a href=/people/581 target=_blank>Parmenides</a> too, the Great, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> calls him in the Sophist, writes in the following manner concerning the Deity: <br /> Many the proofs that show <br />The Deity knows neither birth nor death, <br />Sole of His kind, complete, immovable. <br />'Moreover, <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says that He is <br />Sole king and lord of all the immortal gods, <br />With whom no other may in power contend. <br />'Nay, further, Tragedy also draws us away from the idols, and teaches us to look up to heaven. For as <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a>, who composed the Histories, says in the passage concerning <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> openly cries out upon the stage: <br />There is in truth One God, and One alone, <br />Who made the lofty heavens, and wide-spread earth, <br />The sea's blue wave, and might of warring winds. <br />But we poor mortals with deceived heart, <br />Seeking some solace for our many woes, <br />Raised images of gods in stone or bronze, <br />Or figures Wrought of gold or ivory; <br />And when we crowned their sacrifice, and held <br />High festival, we thought this piety. <br />'<a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, too, says in his tragedy upon the same stage: <br />Seest thou this boundless ether spread on high, <br />With watery arms embracing all the earth? <br />Call this thy <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, deem this thine only god. <br />'In the drama of <a href=/people/1493 target=_blank>Pirithous</a> also the same tragic poet speaks as follows: <br /> Thee we sing, the Self-begotten, <br />Who all nature dost embrace, <br />And mid yon bright ether guidest <br />In her everlasting race. <br />Day and dusky night returning <br />Deck for Thee heaven's wide expanse: <br />Myriad stars for ever burning <br />Weave round Thee their mystic dance. <br />'For here he speaks of the Creative mind as the Self-begotten, and all things that follow are ranked with the cosmos, in which also are the alternations of light and darkness. </p>                        </div>

And the strangest thing of all is, that the Deity seems to be known to <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, who represents the gods as subject to human passions, yet even so does not gain the respect of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says at least: <br /><a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, why with active feet pursue, <br />Thou mortal, me Immortal? <br />Knowest thou not My Godhead? <br />'For he has made it clear that the deity cannot be apprehended by a mortal, nor perceived by feet, or hands, or eyes, or by the body at all. To whom have ye likened the Lord? Or to what likeness have ye compared Him? says the Scripture.  Is He an image that a workman made, or did a goldsmith melt gold and spread it over Him?  and the rest. <br />'The Comic poet <a href=/people/304 target=_blank>Epicharmus</a> also, in his Republic, speaks evidently of the Word (Reason) in this manner: <br /> Greatest need hath man of Reason and of number in life's ways; <br />For in them is our salvation, and by them we mortals live. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a>, the Comic poet, writes what answers to this in these very words: <br />For whosoever brings a sacrifice <br />Of countless <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> or <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a>, O <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>, <br />Or aught like these, who works of art designs, <br />Vestments of gold or purple, life-like forms <br />Graven in emerald or ivory, <br />And hopes thereby God's favour may be <br />Won He strangely errs, and hath a dullard's mind. <br />Man's duty is to help his brother man, <br />Nor simple maid nor wedded wife betray. <br />Nor steal nor murder for foul lucre's sake. <br />Then covet not, dear friend, a needle's thread, <br />For God is ever near to watch thy deeds. <br />' I am a God at hand, and not a God far off. Shall man do aught in secret places, and I not see him? So God speaks by <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>.

And of mankind both Greeks and Barbarians all have this conception; and nowhere is there any race either of husbandmen or of shepherds, nay not even of the dwellers in cities, who can live without being prepossessed by the belief in that higher power.

But if this is so we shall show the soul to be perishable and not immortal. <br />'For if this is admitted, that nothing in nature is without its opposite, and that all things in the world have been arranged by God out of the nature of these opposites, He having impressed upon them a friendship and communion, as of dry with moist, and hot with cold, heavy with light, white with black, sweet with bitter, hard with soft, and on all qualities of this kind one other combination including them all, and then upon the impassible essence a combination with the passible, and if the combined and mingled elements naturally in time undergo a separation from each other, and if it is to be assumed that the soul has been produced out of an impassible and a passible essence, then, in the same way as the intermediate colour, so also this must naturally disappear in time, when the opposite elements in its composition press towards their proper nature. <br />'For do we not see that what is naturally heavy, even though it be lifted up by us, or by any natural lightness being added to it from without, presses down as before in its own natural direction? How in like manner also that which is by nature light, if borne downward by similar external causes, presses upward itself as before? For things which have been combined into one out of two mutual opposites cannot possibly remain always in the same state, unless there is always in them some third kind of natural substance. <br />'But soul in fact is not any third thing compounded of two mutual opposites, but simple and in its sameness of nature impassible and incorporeal: whence <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> and his School said that it was immortal. <br />'Since, however, it is a doctrine common to all that man is made of soul and body, and the motions which take place within us apart from the body, whether voluntary or involuntary, are said to be affections of the soul, most of the philosophers, guessing hereby that its substance is passible, say that it is mortal and of a corporeal nature, not incorporeal. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was driven to interweave the passible element with its naturally impassible essence.

But they who did not discern Him who sits as charioteer ascribed the causes of all things which are done in the world to those who are yoked under Him, as if they worked independently. But the most sacred Lawgiver changes their ignorance into knowledge, when He speaks thus: Lest, when thou beholdest the sun and the moon and the stars and all the host of heaven, thou be deceived and worship them. <br />'With well-directed aim and nobly did he call the acceptance of the above-mentioned as gods a deception. For they saw that the seasons of the year, in which the generations of animals and plants and fruits are brought to completion in definite periods, of time are settled by the advance and retreat of the Sun; they saw also that the Moon as handmaid and successor of the Sun had taken up by night the care and superintendence of the same as the Sun by day, and that the other luminaries in accordance with their sympathy towards things terrestrial were working and doing countless services for the permanence of the whole; and so they fell into an endless delusion in supposing that these were the only gods. <br />'Whereas if they had been attentive to walk by the unerring path they would have learned at once that in the same way as sense is the servant of mind, so also were all who can be perceived by sense made ministers of Him whom mind alone can perceive.' </p>                        </div>

For the disciples of <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> take a very vigorous lead in this argument. <br />'So much the more then, my dear <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, are we bound to examine it, and that from its first principle, as they themselves suggest. <br />'Yes, by all means: for in fact, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, about these Heracleitean doctrines, or, as you call them, Homeric and still older, it is no more possible to argue with the men themselves at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> who pretend to be experts than with men in a frenzy. For in absolute accordance with his writings they are always adrift, and as to dwelling upon an argument and a question, and quietly answering and asking in turn, they have less than no power at all; or rather the expression not even nothing is preferable in view of the absence of even the least quietness in the men. But if you ask any of them a question, they pull out as from a quiver dark little phrases which they shoot off at you, and if you try to get an explanation of what this means, you will presently be struck with another new-fangled phrase, and will never come to any conclusion at all with any of them, no, nor yet they themselves with one another; but they watch most carefully not to allow anything to be settled either in argument, or in their own souls, thinking, I suppose, that it would be something stationary; and with that they are altogether at war, and drive it out everywhere to the utmost of their power. <br />'Perhaps, <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, you have seen the men fighting, but have never been in their company when at peace; for they are no friends of yours. But, I suppose, they explain doctrines of this peaceful kind at leisure to their disciples, whomsoever they wish to make like themselves. <br />'Disciples, my good Sir! Such people do not become disciples one of another, but they grow up of themselves, inspired each of them from any chance source, and the one thinking that the other knows nothing.

One says that existences are three, and some of them are sometimes warring in a manner with one another, and then becoming friends again they exhibit marriages, and births, and rearing of offspring: another says that they are two, moist and dry, or hot and cold, and he makes them dwell together and marries them. But all the Eleatic tribe in our part, beginning with <a href=/people/671 target=_blank>Xenophanes</a> and still earlier, assume that all things so-called are one, and so proceed with their fables.

For it is ever separating and being united, as the more strong-minded <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> assert; but the weaker relax the perpetual continuance of these conditions, and say that in turn the universe is now one and friendly under the influence of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, and then many and at war with itself through some discordance.

For in other respects they did not abide by the original tradition, but partly weakened it in many ways, and partly distorted it: and beginning from his time, sooner or later they diverged purposely or unconsciously, and partly from some other cause perhaps other than rivalry. <br />'And though for the sake of <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> I do not wish to say anything disparaging, nevertheless I am more anxious to defend <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. For in fact it grieves me that they did not do and suffer everything to maintain in every way an entire agreement with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> on all points. Yet <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> deserved this at their hands, for though not superior to <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> the Great, yet neither perhaps was he inferior to him; and it was by closely following and reverencing him that the friends of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> became the chief causes of his great reputation. <br />'And the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a>, having observed this, though they were wrong, were never seen on any point to have opposed the doctrines of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> in any way; but by acknowledging that they held the same opinions with a learned sage they naturally for this reason gained the title themselves: and with the later <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a> it was for the most part a fixed rule never to express any opposition either to one another or to <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> on any point worth mentioning: but innovation is with them a transgression or rather an impiety, and is condemned. And for this reason no one even dares to differ, but from their constant agreement among themselves their doctrines are quietly held in perfect peace. Thus the School of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> is like some true republic, perfectly free from sedition, with one mind in common and one consent; from which cause they were, and are, and seemingly will be zealous disciples. <br />'But the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> sect is torn by factions, which began with their founders, and have not ceased even yet. They delight in refuting one another with angry arguments, one party among them having still remained steadfast, and others having changed. So their founders are like extreme oligarchs, who by quarrelling among themselves have caused those who came after to censure freely both their predecessors and each other, as still being more Stoical one party than the other, and especially those who showed themselves more captious in technicalities; for these were the very men who, surpassing the others in meddlesomeness and petty quibbles, were the more quick to find fault. <br />'Long before these, however, there was the same feeling in those who drew their doctrines from <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> in different directions, <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> in his own way, and <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a> in his, and elsewhere the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=ethnic long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretrians</a> in ways of their own, and others with them. <br />'And the cause was, that as <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> assumed three gods, and philosophized before them in the strains appropriate to each, his hearers did not understand this, but thought that he spoke all at random, and according to the breath of fortune which at any moment prevailed, sometimes one, sometimes another, as it chanced to blow. <br />'But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> had been a <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>, and knew that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> for the same reason took such sayings from no other source than that, and had known what he was saying; and so he too wrapped up his subjects in a manner that was neither usual nor plain to understand; and after conducting them each in the way that he thought fit, and disguising them so as to be half seen and half unseen, he wrote in safety, but himself gave occasion to the subsequent dissension, and distraction of his doctrines, not indeed from jealousy nor yet from ill will — but I am unwilling to speak unfavourable words of men of earlier times. <br />'But now that we have learned this, we ought rather to apply our judgement to a different point, and as we proposed at the commencement to distinguish <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> from <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, so now again separating him from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>, if God help us, we will allow him to be in and of himself a <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a>. Since now being torn in pieces more furiously than any <a href=/people/283 target=_blank>Pentheus</a> deserved, he suffers limb by limb, but is by no means transformed from his whole self and retransformed. <br />'As a man therefore who stood midway between <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> he reduced the sternness of the former to benevolence, and the wit and playfulness of the latter he raised from irony to dignity and gravity, and by making just this mixture of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> he showed himself more affable than the one and more grave than the other. <br />'This, however, is not at all what I was going to discuss, my present inquiry having no concern herewith: but I will pass on to what I had intended, lest I should be thrown out of the way that leads thither, or else I seem likely to run away altogether. <br />'<a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> became disciples of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, for I am going to mention them again at last. Of <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> I remember to have said that he attended <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> and then <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, and afterwards became a <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> in the School of <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>: but now let him be accounted to have also derived something from <a href=/people/989 target=_blank>Stilpo</a> and those Heracleitean discourses. <br />'For since as fellow disciples of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> were emulous of each other, the one of them took as his allies in their mutual contest <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a>, and <a href=/people/989 target=_blank>Stilpo</a>, and also <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a>, among whom he was made by <a href=/people/989 target=_blank>Stilpo</a> a disputant, by <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> austere, and by <a href=/people/249 target=_blank>Crates</a> cynical: but the other, <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, has <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, and <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a> the Piatonist, and <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>, and then <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a>, and of these <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a> made him persuasive, <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> sophistical, and <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> versatile, and reckless, and nothing at all. <br />'And this was the meaning of a certain hexameter verse often applied to him in an insulting parody: <br /><a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> before, and <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> behind, in the midst <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>. </p>                        </div>

For to keep to one argument and ever say the same thing, was not possible for him, nor indeed did he ever think such a course by any means worthy of a clever man. So he went by the name of a <br />Keen sophist, slayer of men unskilled in fence. <br />'For by preparation and study in the delusive show of his arguments he used to stupefy and juggle like the Empusae, and could neither know anything himself nor let others know: he spread terror and confusion, and in carrying off the prize for sophistries and deceitful arguments, he rejoiced over his disgrace, and prided himself wonderfully on not knowing either what is base or noble, or what is good or bad, but after saying whichever came into his thoughts, he would change again and upset his argument in many more ways than he had constructed it. <br />'So he would cut himself and be cut in pieces like a <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>hydra</a>, neither side being distinguished from the other, and without regard to decency; nevertheless he pleased his hearers, who while they listened saw also that he was good-looking: he was most pleasing therefore both to hear and to see, after they grew accustomed to accept from him arguments proceeding from a beautiful face and mouth, besides the kindliness which shone in his eyes. <br />'Now this description must not be taken loosely, but from the beginning such was his character. For having associated in boyhood with <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, a man of gentle and amorous disposition, <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> being beautiful and still in the bloom of youth gained the love of <a href=/people/1532 target=_blank>Crantor</a> the Academic, and attached himself to him; and being not without natural ability, he let it run its swift and easy course, and fired by love of disputation he gained help from <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> in those elegant and artfully studied plausibilities, and also attended the School of <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> (now <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> had begun somewhere or other from the School of <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>), so <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, equipped from this source, adhered, except in name, to <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a>, as one who overthrew all things. <br /><a href=/people/1566 target=_blank>Mnaseas</a> at least, and <a href=/people/1034 target=_blank>Philomelus</a>, and <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a>, the Sceptics, call him a Sceptic, as they were themselves, because he also overthrew truth and falsehood and probability. <br />Therefore, although on account of his <a href=/people/10159 target=_blank>Pyrrhonistic</a> doctrines he might have been called a <a href=/people/10159 target=_blank>Pyrrhonist</a>, yet from respect for his lover he submitted to be still called an Academic. He was therefore a <a href=/people/10159 target=_blank>Pyrrhonist</a>, except in name: but an Academic he was not, except in being so called. For I do not believe what <a href=/people/336 target=_blank>Diocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidos</a> asserts in his Diatribae so-entitled, that through fear of the followers of <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, and of the Sophist <a href=/people/1168 target=_blank>Bion</a>, who used to assail the philosophers, and shrank from no means of refuting them, <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> took precautions, in order to avoid trouble, by never appearing to suggest any dogma, but used to put forward the suspense of judgement as a protection, like the black juice which the cuttle-fishes throw out. This then I do not believe. <br />'Those, however, who started from this School, <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> and <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, with such auxiliary forces of arguments helping both sides in the war, forgot the origin from, which they had started in the School of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>: <br />And parting, formed in order of attack. Together rushed <br />Bucklers and lances, and the furious might <br />Of mail-clad warriors; bossy shield on shield <br />Clattered in conflict; loud the clamour rose. <br />Buckler to buckler pressed, and helm to helm, <br />And man to man. <br />Man struggling hand to hand with man. <br />Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of man, <br />Slaying and slain ; </p>                        </div>

But beaten they would be, and their foundation shaken, if they were to have neither principle nor starting-point for the battle. Now the principle was to prove that they did not express the thoughts of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>; and their starting-point was lost, if they altered the definition concerning the conceptual presentation by the removal of a single word. <br />'It is not now the proper time for me to show this, but I will mention it again, when I arrive exactly at this point. When, however, they had come to open variance, it was not that the two struck at each other, but only <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> at <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>. For <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> in his fighting had a certain solemnity and heaviness, not more effective than the oratory of <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a>: for he, <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a>, when he saw his own teacher <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> attacked by <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, though he was ignorant and unacquainted with <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, yet from perceiving that the works of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> were highly esteemed, supposed that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s philosophy agreed with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s, and in trying to make war upon <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> struck at <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and having drawn his first accusation from the Ideas, ended by attacking his other doctrines, of which he knew nothing himself, but guessed the received opinions concerning them by the way in which they are usually described. <br />However, this <a href=/people/619 target=_blank>Cephisodorus</a> instead of fighting the man with whom he was at war, fought with the one against whom he wished not to make war. But if <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> himself after getting rid of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, had abstained also from making war upon <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, he would have shown himself, in my judgement, an excellent philosopher, in so keeping the peace. But if he acted with a knowledge perhaps of the doctrines of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, though in ignorance of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, to judge from what he wrote against him, he is convicted of taking an inconsistent course, in not striking the one whom he knew, and insulting most foully and disgracefully the man whom he had no right to assail, and treating him far worse than he should have treated a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. <br />However, he certainly showed a high spirit in his disregard of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>: for either through ignorance of his doctrines, or through fear of the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>, he turned aside the mighty jaws of bitter war against <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. But of <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>'s vile and utterly shameless revolts against <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> I shall speak again, if I can spare time from philosophy. I hope, however, never to have so much time to spare, at least for this purpose, unless it be in sport. <br />'So, when <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> saw that <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> was a professional rival, and worth conquering, he shrank from nothing in trying to overthrow the arguments set forth by him. <br />'Now of the other points on which he was at war with him, I perhaps am not able to speak, or even if I were able, there would be no need to mention them now: but as <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> was the first inventor of the following doctrine, and as he, <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, saw that both itself and its name were famous at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, I mean, the conceptual presentation, he employed every device against it. But the other being in the weaker position could suffer no injury by keeping quiet, and so disregarded <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, against whom he would have had much to say, but was unwilling, or rather perhaps there was some other cause; but <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> being no longer among the living he proceeded to fight with his shadow, and tried to cry him down by uttering all kinds of vulgar buffoonery, thinking that neither could <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> defend himself, nor would any one else care to avenge him: or if <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> should care to do so, he thought that at all events he should be a gainer by diverting the attack of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> from himself. He knew also that <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> had practised this artifice upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>. <br />'The <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> listened in amazement. For their <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> was not even then learned nor productive of such <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> as those by which <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> talked them down, knocking off this argument, cutting away that, and tripping up others, and so succeeded in persuading them. When therefore those against whom he argued were worsted, and those in whose midst he was speaking were astounded, the men of that day were somehow convinced that neither speech was anything, nor feeling, nor any single work however small, nor on the contrary would anything ever have seemed useless, except what so seemed in the opinion of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389269PPit class=person long=26.9339 lat=38.9336>Pitane</a>.

And he would take out what things he wanted, and do all other such, work with his own hands, not at all as approving self-dependence, nor as being in any poverty, nor in want of servants, for he certainly had servants such as they were: but the reason you are at liberty to guess. <br />'However, I will go on to tell the pretty story which I promised. For while acting as his own steward he thought that he ought not to carry the key about on his own person, but he used after locking up to hide the key in a certain hollow writing-case: and after sealing this with a ring, he used to roll the ring down through the keyhole and leave it inside the house, so that afterwards when he came back, and opened with the key, he would be able to pick up the ring, and lock up again, and then to seal, and then to throw the ring back again inside through the keyhole. </p>                        </div>

And from this beginning he took to studying with <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> the philosophy that we can neither see nor hear anything clear or sound; and having once drawn one of his companions into the house, he began to argue with him on the suspense of judgement with extraordinary Tehemence, as it seemed, and said, This indeed I can state to you as an indisputable fact, haying learned it from my own case, not from questioning any other. <br />'And then he began and described the whole misfortune which had happened to him about the storeroom. What then, said he, could <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> now say against incomprehensibility thus in all points proved manifest to me in such circumstances as these? For as I locked it up with my own hands, sealed it myself, and myself threw the ring inside, and when I came again and opened it, saw the ring inside but not my other property, how can I fail to be justly incredulous of all things? For I shall not dare for my part to say that any one came and stole the things, as there was the ring inside. <br />'Then his hearer, who was an insolent fellow, having heard out the whole story as well as he could listen, being scarce able hitherto to contain himself, burst out into a very broad laugh, and still laughing and chuckling tried between whiles to refute his silly notion. So beginning from that time <a href=/people/1565 target=_blank>Lacydes</a> no longer used to throw the ring inside, and ceased to use in argument the incomprehensibility of his storeroom, but began to comprehend his losses, and found that he had been philosophizing over them in vain. <br />'Nevertheless his servants were impudent knaves, and not to be caught with one band, but just such as the slaves you see in comedy, a <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> or a Dacus, loud-tongued in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=demonym long=25 lat=44.5>Dacian</a> chatter; and after they had listened to the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>' sophisms, or had learned them in some other way, went straight at the venture, and used to take off his seal, and sometimes they would substitute another instead of it, but sometimes they did not even this, because they thought it would be all incomprehensible to him, whether this way or any other. <br />'So when he came in, he used to examine, and when he saw the writing-case unsealed, or, though sealed, yet with a different seal, he was very angry: but when they said that it was sealed, for they could themselves see his own seal, he would begin a subtle argument and demonstration. And when they were beaten by his demonstration, and said that, if the seal was not there, perhaps he had himself forgotten and not sealed it up, Yes, certainly, he said, he remembered that he had himself sealed it up, and began to prove it, and argue all round, and thinking that they were making sport of him, he would make violent complaints against them with many oaths. <br />'But they suspected his attacks, and began to think that he was making sport of them; since <a href=/people/1565 target=_blank>Lacydes</a>, who was a philosopher, had decided that he could have no opinion, and therefore no memory, for memory is a kind of opinion; a short time ago at least they had heard him, they said, speak thus to his friends. <br />'But when he overthrew their attempts and used language not at all Academic, they would go themselves to the school of some <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, and learn anew what they ought to say, and with that preparation would meet sophistry with sophistry, and show themselves rivals of the Academic school in the art of thievery; Then he would find fault with the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>; but his servants would put aside his accusations by alleging incomprehensibility with no little jeering. <br />'So discussions went on there on all points, and arguments and counter-arguments; and in the meanwhile there was not a single thing left, no vessel, nor anything that was put in the vessel, nor any other things that make up the furnishing of a house. <br />'And <a href=/people/1565 target=_blank>Lacydes</a> for a while was at a loss, seeing that the support of his own doctrines was of no help to him; and thinking that, if he could not convict them, everything he had would be upset, he fell into perplexity, and began to cry out upon his neighbours and upon the gods, Oh! Oh! and Alas! Alas! and By all the gods, and By the goddesses, and all the other artless affirmations of men who in cases of distrust take to strong language — all these were uttered with loud shouting and asseveration. <br />'But at last, since he had a battle of contradiction in the house, the master, doubtless, took to playing the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> with his servants, and when the servants insisted, on the Academic doctrines, in order that they might have no more trouble, he became a constant stay-at-home, sitting before his storeroom. And when he could do no good, he began to suspect what his philosophy was coming to, and opened his mind. Of these things, my boys, said he, we talk in our discussions one way, but we live in another.' </p>                        </div>

And when he had stood his ground and was successful, then at once he would voluntarily disregard his previous opinion, and make no mention of it. <br />'For while granting that there are both truth and falsehood in all things, as if he were co-operating in the method of inquiry, he would give a hold like a clever wrestler and thereby get the advantage.

For example, he said that he ought to learn geometry so far as to be able, if ever it should be necessary, rightly to measure land either in taking or giving possession, or in allotting it, or marking out work. And this, he said, was so easy to learn that one who gave his mind to the measuring could know at once how much land there was, and go away acquainted with the mode of measuring it. <br />'But of learning geometry so far as to reach those unintelligible diagrams he disapproved, for he said he did not see of what use these were, although he was not unacquainted with them. But they were enough, he said, to exhaust a man's lifetime, and hindered him from many other useful branches of learning. <br />'He bade them also become acquainted with astronomy, but this also only so far as to be able to know the time of night, or of the month, or of the year, for the sake of travelling, or voyaging, or keeping watch, and to be able to make use of the indications relating to all other things that are to be done either in the night, or in the month, or year, by knowing the different seasons for the works before mentioned. These also, he said, were easy to learn from nocturnal hunters, and pilots, and many others, whose business it is to know these things. <br />'But he strongly dissuaded from learning astronomy to such an extent as to know the bodies which are not in the same orbit, and the planets and comets, and to waste time in investigating their distances from the earth, and their periods, and the causes of them. For he said that in these matters he did not see any benefit, and yet even in these he was not uninstructed. But he said of these also that they were enough to wear out a man's lifetime, and to hinder him from many useful pursuits. <br />'And he wholly dissuaded one from anxiously inquiring in what way the heavenly bodies are each contrived by God; for he neither thought that these things could be discovered by mankind, nor did he believe that the gods would be pleased with the man who sought to know what they had not been willing to make clear. But he said that the man who troubled himself about these things would be in danger even of going as mad as <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> was, who prided himself very highly upon explaining the contrivances of the gods. <br />'For when he used to say that fire and the sun were the same, he ignored the fact that though men easily discern, the fire, yet they cannot look upon the sun; and by being exposed to the sunshine they have their complexions darkened, but not so by fire. Also he was ignorant that of plants which spring out of the earth none can make good growth without the light of the sun, while all perish when heated by fire. And in saying that the sun was a fiery stone he was ignorant also of this fact, that while a stone set in the fire neither shines nor lasts long, the sun continues all the time to be the brightest of all things. <br />'He also used to bid us learn to count; but here also as in everything else he bade us guard against useless trouble: yet as far as it was useful he would himself help his companions in examining and discussing all things.' </p>                        </div>

What their nature is it is neither easy to discover nor lawful to inquire. For it pertains not to slaves to know the nature or conduct of their masters, beyond what their service requires. And what is of most importance, in proportion as we ought to admire one who spends labour upon the interests of mankind, so to those who strive to get fame from many inopportune and vain attempts it brings the more trouble. For when, O <a href=/people/1038 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, has any one ever heard <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> talking about the heaven, or encouraging any one to learn about geometrical lines for correction of morals? As to music we know that he understood it only by ear; but he was constantly telling them on every occasion what was noble, and what manliness was, and justice, and other virtues: he used in fact to call the interests of mankind absolute good; and all things else, he used to say, were either impossible to be achieved by men, or were akin to fables, playthings of Sophists in their supercilious discussions.

The learning then which we are seeking must have this quality in addition to the former. What quality? It must be of some use to men of war. It certainly must, if possible. They were to be educated, we said before, in gymnastic and music. It was so, said he.

It cannot. Can then music, so far as we previously discussed it? Nay, said he, that, if you remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic, as training our guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony imparting not science but a kind of harmoniousness, and by rhythm a rhythmical movement, and as having in its words certain other moral tendencies akin to these, whether the subjects of its discourse were fabulous or partly true; but it contained no instruction tending to such an end as you are now seeking. <br />'You remind me very correctly, said I; for music certainly contained nothing of the kind.

After studying philosophy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> he came as an elderly man to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>. He says that all things come from water, and are all resolved into water. And he forms his conjecture first from the fact that seed, which is watery, is the first principle of all animal life; thus it is probable that all things have their origin from moisture. His second argument is that all plants derive nourishment and fruitfulness from moisture, and when deprived of it wither away. And the third, that the very fire of the sun, and of the stars, and the world itself are nourished by the evaporations of the waters.

So he says the reason why the infinite exists is that the subsisting creation may not be deficient in any point. But he also is at fault in not saying what the infinite is, whether it is air, or water, or earth, or any other corporeal elements; he is wrong therefore in declaring the matter while excluding the efficient cause. For the infinite is nothing else than matter, and matter cannot have an actual existence, unless the efficient cause underlie it. <br />'<a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=person long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> declared that the air is the first principle of all things, for from this all are produced, and into it they are resolved again. For example, our soul, he says, is air, for it holds us together; and the whole world too is encompassed by air and breath, and air and breath are used as synonyms. But he too is wrong in thinking that living beings consist of simple homogeneous air and breath; for it is impossible that the matter can exist as sole principle of things, but we must assume the efficient cause also. As for instance silver suffices not for the production of the drinking-cup, unless there be the efficient cause, that is the silversmith; the case is similar with copper and various kinds of wood, and all other matter. <br />'<a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a> and <a href=/people/1834 target=_blank>Hippasus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404168PMet class=person long=16.824 lat=40.383>Metapontum</a> say that fire is the principle of all things: for from fire, they say, all things are produced and all end in fire: and all things in the world are created as it gradually cools down. For first the coarsest part of it is pressed together and becomes earth; then the earth being resolved by the natural force of the fire is turned into water, and being vaporised becomes air. And again the world and all the bodies in it are consumed in a conflagration by fire. Fire therefore is the first principle, because all things come from it, and the end, inasmuch as they are all resolved into it. <br />'<a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, who was followed long after by <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, said that the first principles of all things are bodies indivisible, but conceivable by reason, with no admixture of vacuum, uncreated, imperishable, not capable of being broken, nor of receiving shape from their parts, nor of being altered in quality, but perceptible by reason only; that they move, however, in the vacuum, and through the vacuum, and that both the vacuum itself is infinite and the bodies infinite. And the bodies possess these three properties, shape, magnitude, and weight. <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, however, said two, magnitude and shape; but <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> added to them a third, namely weight. For he said the bodies must be moved by the impulse of the weight, since otherwise they will not be moved at all. The shapes of the atoms are limitable, not infinite: for there are none either hook-shaped, nor trident-shaped, nor ring-shaped. For these shapes are easily broken, whereas the atoms are impassive and cannot be broken; but they have their proper shapes, which are conceivable by reason. And the atom is so called, not because it is extremely small, but because it cannot be divided, being impassive, and free from admixture of vacuum: so that if a man says atom he means unbreakable, impassive, unmixed with vacuum. And that the atom exists is manifest: for there are also elements (στοιχεῖα), and living beings that are empty, and there is the Monad. <br />'<a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>, son of <a href=/people/1479 target=_blank>Meton</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373136PAkr class=place long=13.5855 lat=37.2906>Agrigentum</a>, says that there are four elements, fire, air, water, earth, and, two original forces, love and hate, of which the one tends to unite, and the other to separate.

When therefore the bones are lifted in their sockets, the muscles by their relaxation and contraction make me able, I suppose, now to bend my limbs, and this is the cause why I am sitting here with my knees bent. </p>                        </div>

We should argue, that though reason is the most divine of our faculties, yet nevertheless we have need also of sense, just as we have of the body. And it is evidently the nature of sense also to be true: for it is not possible that the sentient subject should not be in some way affected, and being affected he must know the affection: therefore sensation also is a kind of knowledge. <br />'Moreover if sensation is a kind of affection, and everything that is affected is affected by something, that which acts must certainly be other than that which is acted on.

But his disciple <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> says that the man who means to be happy must look to these three things: first, what are the natural qualities of things; secondly, in what way we should be disposed towards them; and lastly, what advantage there will be to those who are so disposed. <br />'The things themselves then, he professes to show, are equally indifferent, and unstable, and indeterminate, and therefore neither our senses nor our opinions are either true or false. For this reason then we must not trust them, but be without opinions, and without bias, and without wavering, saying of every single thing that it no more is than is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not. <br />'To those indeed who are thus disposed the result, <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> says, will be first speechlessness, and then imperturbability, but <a href=/people/2202 target=_blank>Aenesidemus</a> says pleasure. <br />'These then are the chief points of their arguments: and now let us consider whether they are right in what they say. Since therefore they say that all things are equally indifferent, and bid us for this reason attach ourselves to none, nor hold any opinion, I think one may reasonably ask them, whether those who think things differ are in error or not. For if they are in error, surely they cannot be right in their supposition. So they will be compelled to say that there are some who have false opinions about things, and they themselves therefore must be those who speak the truth: and so there must be truth and falsehood. But if we the many are not in error in thinking that things differ, what do they mean by rebuking us? For they must be in error themselves in maintaining that they do not differ. <br />'Moreover if we should even grant to them that all things are equally indifferent, it is evident that even they themselves would not differ from the multitude. What then would their wisdom, be? And why does <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> abuse all other persons, and sing the praises of <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> only? <br />'Yet, further, if all things are equally indifferent and we ought therefore to have no opinion, there would be no difference even in these cases, I mean in the differing or not differing, and the having or not having an opinion. For why should things of this kind be rather than not be? Or, as <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> says, why yes, and why no, and why the very Why? itself? It is manifest therefore that inquiry is done away: so let them cease from troubling. For at present there is no method in their madness, while, in the very act of admonishing us to have no opinion, they at the same time bid us to form an opinion, and in saying that men ought to make no statement they make a statement themselves: and though they require you to agree with no one, they command you to believe themselves: and then though they say they know nothing, they reprove us all, as if they knew very well. <br />'And those who assert that all things are uncertain must do one of two things, either be silent, or speak and state something. If then they should hold their peace, it is evident that against such there would be no argument. But if they should make a statement, anyhow and by all means they must say that something either is or is not, just as they certainly now say that all things are to all men matters not of knowledge but of customary opinion, and that nothing can be known. <br />'The man therefore who maintains this either makes the matter clear, and it is possible to understand it as spoken, or it is impossible. But if he does not make it clear, there can be absolutely no arguing in this case either with such a man. But if he should make his meaning clear, he must certainly either state what is indefinite or what is definite: and if indefinite, neither in this case would there be any arguing with him, for of the indefinite there can be no knowledge. But if the statements, or any one of them whatever, be definite, the man who states this defines something and decides. How then can all things be unknowable and indeterminate? But should he say that the same thing both is and is not, in the first place the same thing will be both true and false, and next he will both say a thing and not say it, and by use of speech will destroy speech, and moreover, while acknowledging that he speaks falsely, says that we ought to believe him. <br />'Now it is worth inquiring whence they learned what they say, that all things are uncertain. For they ought to know beforehand what certainty is: thus at all events they would be able to say that things have not this quality of certainty. First they ought to know affirmation, and then negation. But if they are ignorant of the nature of certainty, neither can they know what uncertainty is. <br />'When indeed <a href=/people/2202 target=_blank>Aenesidemus</a> in his Outline goes through the nine moods (in all of which he has attempted to prove the uncertainty of things), which are we to say, that he speaks with knowledge of them or without knowledge? For he says that there is a difference in animals, and in ourselves, and in states, and in the modes of life, and customs, and laws: he says also that our senses are feeble, and that the external hindrances to knowledge are many, such as distances, magnitudes, and motions: and further, the difference of condition in men young and old, and waking and sleeping, and healthy and sick: and nothing that we perceive is simple and unmixed; for all things are confused, and spoken in a relative sense. <br />'But when he was making these and other such fine speeches, one would have liked, I say, to ask hirn whether he was stating with full knowledge that this is the condition of things, or without knowledge. For if he did not know, how could we believe him? But if he knew, he was vastly silly for declaring at the same time that all things are uncertain, and yet saying that he knew so much. <br />'Moreover whenever they go through such details, they are only making a sort of induction, showing what is the nature of the phenomena and of the particulars: and a process of this kind both is, and is called, a proof. If therefore they assent to it, it is evident that they form an opinion: and if they disbelieve it, neither should we choose to give heed to them. <br />'<a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> moreover in the <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a> relates a story at great length, how he met <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> walking towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> past the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383238SAmp class=place long=23.8461 lat=38.2911>sanctuary</a> of <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>, and what they talked about to each other. Might not then any one who stood beside him while writing this reasonably say, Why trouble yourself, poor fellow, in writing this, and relating what you do not know? For why rather did you meet him than not meet him, and talk with him rather than not talk? <br />'And this same wonderful <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a>, did he know the reason why he was walking to see the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> games? Or was he wandering, like a madman, along the road? And when he began to find fault with mankind and their ignorance, are we to say that he spoke truth or not, and that <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> was affected in a certain way and agreed with his sayings, or did not heed them? For if he was not persuaded, how did he pass from a choral dancer to a philosopher, and continue to be an admirer of <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a>? But if he agreed with what was said, he must be an absurd person for taking to philosophy himself but forbidding us to do so. <br />'And one must simply wonder what is the meaning to them of <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a>'s lampoons and railings against all men, and the tedious Rudiments of <a href=/people/2202 target=_blank>Aenesidemus</a> and all the like multitude of words. For if they have written these with an idea that they would render us better, and therefore think it right to confute us all, that so we may cease to talk nonsense, it is evidently their wish that we should know the truth, and assume that things are such as <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> maintains. So if we were to be persuaded by them we should change from worse to better, by forming the more advantageous judgements, and approving those who gave the better advice. <br />'How then could things possibly be equally indifferent and indeterminate? And how could we avoid giving assent and forming opinions? And if there is no use in arguments, why do they trouble us? Or why does <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> say, <br />No other mortal could with <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> vie? </p>                        </div>

For what sort of citizen, or judge, or counsellor, or friend, or, in a word, what sort of man would such an one be? Or what evil deeds would not he dare, who held that nothing is really evil, or disgraceful, or just or unjust? For one could not say even this, that such men are afraid of the laws and their penalties; for how should they, seeing that, as they themselves say, they are incapable of feeling or of trouble? <br />'<a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> indeed even says this of <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a>: <br />O what a man I knew, void of conceit, <br />Daunted by none, who whether known to fame <br />Or nameless o'er the fickle nations rule, <br />This way and that weighed down by passion's force, <br />Opinion false, and legislation vain. <br />'When, however, they utter this wise saw, that one ought to live in accordance with nature and with customs, and yet not to assent to anything, they are too silly. For they require one to assent to this at least, if to nothing else, and to assume that it is so. But why ought one, rather than ought not, to follow nature and customs, if forsooth we know nothing, and have no means whereby to judge? <br />'It is altogether a silly thing, when they say, that just as cathartic drugs purge out themselves together with the excrements, in like manner the argument which maintains that all things are uncertain together with everything else destroys itself also. For supposing it to refute itself, they who use it must talk nonsense. It were better therefore for them to hold their peace, and not open their mouth at all, <br />'But in truth there is no similarity between the cathartic drug and their argument. For the drug is secreted and does not remain in the body: the argument, however, must be there in men's souls, as being always the same and gaining their belief, for it can be only this that makes them incapable of assent. <br />'But that it is not possible for a man to have no opinions, one may learn in the following manner. For it is impossible that he who perceives by sense does not perceive: now perception by sense is a kind of knowledge. And that he also believes his sensation is evident to all: for when he wishes to see more exactly, he wipes his eyes, and comes nearer, and shades them. <br />'Moreover we know that we feel pleasure and pain: for it is not possible for one who is being burned or cut to be ignorant of it. And who would not say that acts of memory surely and of recollection are accompanied by an assumption? But what need one say about common concepts, that such a thing is a man, and again concerning sciences and arts? For there would be none of these, were it not our nature to make assumptions. But for my part I pass over all other arguments. Whether, however, we believe, or whether we disbelieve the arguments used by them, in every way it is an absolute necessity to form an opinion. <br />'It is manifest then that it is impossible to study philosophy in this fashion; and that it is also unnatural and contrary to the laws, we may perceive as follows. For if on the other hand things were in reality of this kind, what would remain but that we must live as if asleep, in a random and senseless fashion? So that our lawgivers, and generals, and educators must all be talking nonsense. To me, however, it seems that all the rest of mankind are living in a natural way, but only those who talk this nonsense are puffed up with conceit, or rather are gone stark mad. <br />'Not least, however, one may learn this from the following case. <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, for instance, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380244PKar class=place long=24.427 lat=38.027>Carystus</a>, who lived about the same times and wrote their biography, says that <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> being pursued by a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> escaped up a tree, and, when laughed at by those who stood by, said that it was difficult to put off the man. And when his sister Philiste was to offer a sacrifice, and then one of her friends promised what was necessary for the sacrifice and did not provide it, but <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> bought it, and was angry, upon his friend saying that his acts were not in accord with his words nor worthy of his impassivity, he replied, In the case of a woman certainly we ought not to make proof of it. Nevertheless his friend might fairly have answered, If there is any good in these arguments of yours, your impassivity is useless in the case even of a woman, or a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, and in all cases. <br />'But it is right to ascertain both who they were that admired him, and whom he himself admired. <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> then was a disciple of one <a href=/people/955 target=_blank>Anaxarchus</a>, and was at first a painter, and not very successful at that; next, after reading the books of <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, he neither found anything useful there nor wrote anything good himself, but spake evil of all, both gods and men. But afterwards wrapping himself up in this conceit, and calling himself free from conceit, he left nothing in writing. <br />'A disciple of his was <a href=/people/12260 target=_blank>Timon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=person long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phlius</a>, who at first was a dancer in the chorus at the theatres, but having afterwards fallen in with <a href=/people/843 target=_blank>Pyrrho</a> he composed offensive and vulgar parodies, in which he has reviled all who ever studied philosophy.

For they, as if oppressed by a kind of torpor, maintained that they knew nothing at all unless some one standing by struck and pricked them; for when burned or cut, they said, they knew that they felt something, but whether what burned them was fire, or what cut them iron, they could not tell. <br />'Men then who talk thus one might immediately ask, whether they at all events know this that they suffer and feel something. For if they do not know, neither could they say that they know only the feeling: if on the other hand they know, the feelings cannot be the only things conceptional. For I am being burned was a statement, and not a feeling. <br />'Moreover these three things must necessarily subsist together, the suffering itself, and that which causes it, and that which suffers.

Whence therefore will he be able to say that this is pleasure, and that pain? Or that he felt something by taste, or sight, or hearing? And by tasting with his tongue, and seeing with his eyes, and hearing with his ears? Or how do they know that it is right to choose this, and avoid that? But supposing them to know none of these things, they will have no impulse nor desire; and so would not be living beings. For they are ridiculous, whenever they say that these things have happened to them, but that they do not know how or in what manner. For such as these could not even say whether they are human beings, nor whether they are alive, nor, therefore, whether they say and declare anything. <br />'What discussion then can there be with such men as these? One may wonder, however, if they know not whether they are upon earth or in heaven; and wonder still more, if they do not know, though they profess to study this kind of philosophy, whether four are more than three, and how many one and two make. For being what they are they cannot even say how many fingers they have on their hands, nor whether each of them is one or more. <br />'So they would not even know their own name, nor their country, nor <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a>: neither therefore whom they love or hate, nor what things they desire.

But next, how did they mean that themselves were wise, if forsooth every one is the measure of truth to himself? Or how do they refute other men, if that which appears to each is true? And how is it that we are ignorant of some things, though we often perceive them by sensation, just as when we hear barbarians speaking? <br />'Moreover the man who has seen anything, and then remembers it, knows it, though he is no longer sensible of it. And if he should shut one eye and see with the other, he will evidently be both knowing and not knowing the same thing. <br />'And in addition to this, if that which appears to each is also true, but what they say does not appear true to us, it must also be true that the Man is not the measure of all things. <br />'Moreover artists are superior to the unskilled, and experts to the inexperienced, and for this reason a pilot, or a physician, or a general foresees better what is about to happen. <br />'These men too absolutely destroy the degrees of the more or less, and the necessary and contingent, and the natural and unnatural. And thus the same thing would both be and not be; for nothing hinders the same thing from appearing to some to be, and to others not to be. And the same thing would be both a man and a block: for sometimes the same thing appears to one a man and to another a block. <br />'Every speech too would be true, but also for this reason false: and counsellors and judges would not have anything to do.

For these seem to be afraid lest, if they should say that some sensations are false, they should not have their criterion and their canon sure and trustworthy: but they fail to see that, if this be so, they should lose no time in declaring that all opinions also are true; for it is natural to us to judge by them also of many things: and nevertheless they maintain that some opinions are true and some false. <br />'And then if one were to examine he would see that none even of the other criteria are always and thoroughly free from error; as for instance I mean a balance, or a turning-lathe, or anything of this kind: but each of them in one condition is sound and in another bad; and when men use it in this way, it tells true, but in that way tells false. Moreover if every sensation were true, they ought not to differ so much. For they are different when near and far off, and in the sick and the strong, and in the skilled and unskilled, and prudent and senseless. And of course it would be altogether absurd to say that the sensations of the mad are true, and of those who see amiss, and hear amiss. For the statement that he who sees amiss either sees or does not see would be silly: for one would answer, that he sees indeed, but not aright. <br />'When, however, they say that sensation being devoid of reason neither adds anything nor takes away, it is evident that they fail to see the obstacles: for in the case of the oar in the water, and in pictures, and numberless other things, it is the sense that deceives. Wherefore in such cases we all lay the blame not on our mind, but on the presentation: for the argument refutes itself when it maintains that every presentation is true. For at all events it declares the falsity of ours, which causes us to think that not every presentation is true. The result then for them is to say that every presentation is both true and false. <br />'And they are altogether wrong in maintaining that things really are just such as they may seem to us: for on the contrary they appear such as they are by nature, and we do not make them to be so, but are ourselves affected in a certain way by them. Since if we were to imagine <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a> or young <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a>, as painters and sculptors do, it would be ridiculous to assert straightway that they existed, and therefore to represent them to ourselves as standing ready at hand.' </p>                        </div>

For though it proves its own existence, something else is wanted to judge of its nature. For though the sensation tells whether the feeling is our own or another's, it is reason that tells whether it is to be chosen or avoided. <br />'They say indeed that they do not themselves welcome every pleasure, and shun every pain. And this is a very natural result. For the criteria prove both themselves and the things which they judge: feeling, however, proves itself only. And that this is so, they bear witness themselves.

And thus in sensation and in forming presentations we look to the external objects, but in experiencing pleasure and pain we turn our attention to ourselves only. For our sensations are caused by the external objects, and as their character may be, such also are the presentations which they produce: but our feelings take this or that character because of ourselves, and according to our state. <br />'Wherefore these appear sometimes pleasant and sometimes unpleasant, and sometimes more and sometimes less. And this being so, we shall find, if we should choose to examine, that the best assumptions of the principles of knowledge are made by those who take into consideration both the senses and the mind. <br />'While the senses are like the toils and nets and other hunting implements of this kind, the mind and the reason are like the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> that track and pursue the prey.

For I think they differ widely. <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> is of all things most full of false pretensions; and in the pleasures of love, the greatest as they are thought, even perjury, as they say, is forgiven by the gods, its votaries being regarded, like children, as possessing not even the smallest share of Reason; while Reason is either the same thing as <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a>, or of all things most like it and most true. <br />'Will you not then next consider Moderation in the same way, whether <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> possesses more of it than <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, or <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a> more than <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a>? <br />'An easy question this again that you propose. For I think one would find nothing in the world of a more immoderate nature than <a href=/people/626 target=_blank>Pleasure</a> and delight, nor any single thing more full of moderation than Reason and Science. <br />'You say well; yet go on to speak of the third point.

Works, of which each as it came into being by itself, and likewise all of them taken together, were seen to be good by Him who commanded them to be made. For the Scripture says, And God saw all things that He had made, and behold, they were very good. <br />'Nay, they will not even be taught by the small and familiar examples lying at their feet, from which they might learn that no useful and beneficial work is made without a special purpose, or by mere accident, but is perfected by handiwork for its proper service: but when it begins to fall off and become useless and unserviceable, then it is dissolved and dispersed in an indefinite and casual way, inasmuch as the wisdom by whose care it was constructed no longer manages nor directs it. <br />'For a cloak is not woven by the warp being arranged without a weaver, or the woof intertwined of its own accord; but if it be worn out, the tattered rags are cast away. A house too or a city is built up not by receiving some stones self-deposited at the foundations, and others jumping up to the higher courses, but the builder brings the well-fitted stones and lays them in their place: but when the building is overthrown, however it may occur, each stone falls down and is lost. <br />'Also while a ship is being built, the keel does not lay itself, and the mast set itself up amidships, and each of the other timbers of itself take any chance position; nor do the so-called hundred pieces of the wagon fit themselves together each in any vacant place it finds: but the carpenter in either case brings them together fitly. <br />'But should the ship go to pieces at sea, or the wagon in its course on land, the timbers are scattered wherever it may chance, in the one case by the waves, and in the other by the violent driving. Thus it would befit them to say that their atoms, as remaining idle, and not made by hands, and of no use, are driven at random.

Or that the all-harmonious quiring of the heavenly bodies derives its concord from tuneless and inharmonious instruments? <br />'Also if there be but one and the same substance of all atoms, and the same imperishable nature, excepting, as they say, their magnitudes and shapes, how is it that some bodies are divine, and incorruptible, and eternal, or at least, as they would say, secular according to him who so named them, both visible and invisible, visible as the sun, and moon, and stars, and earth and water, and invisible as gods, and daemons, and souls?

For some things are said to be packed close and fastened tightly together by them, so that they have become close textures extremely difficult to unloose, while in others the combination of the atoms has been weak and loose in a greater or less degree, so that either quickly or after a long time they separate from their orderly arrangement: and some things are made up of atoms of a certain nature shaped in a certain way, and others of different kinds of atoms differently arranged. <br />'Who is it then that distinguishes the classes, and collects them, and spreads them abroad, and arranges some in this way for a sun, and others in that way to produce the moon, and brings together the several kinds according to their fitness for the light of each separate star? For neither would the solar atoms, of such a number and kind as they are, and in such wise united, ever have condescended to the formation of a moon, nor would the combinations of the lunar atoms ever have become a sun.

For it was a fine distinction drawn by Paul when he said, There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. <br />'And if their combination, as of things without life, took place unconsciously, they required a skilful artificer: and if their conjunction was involuntary and of necessity, as in things without reason, then some wise leader of the flock presided over their gathering. But if they have been willingly confined to the performance of a voluntary work, some marvellous architect took the lead in apportioning their work; or acted as a general who, loving order, does not leave his army in confusion and all mixed up together, but arranges the cavalry in one place, and the heavy-armed infantry separately, and the javelin-men by themselves, and the archers apart, and the slingers in the proper place, that those of like arms might fight side by side. <br />'But if they think this example a jest because I make a comparison between large bodies and very small, we will turn to the very smallest.' </p>                        </div>

For if any of the founders of this impious doctrine reconsidered who and whence he is, he would come to his senses as feeling conscious of himself, and would say, not to the atoms, but to his Father and Maker, Thy hands fashioned me, and made me, and like that writer he would have described still further the wonderful manner of his formation: Hast Thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? Clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews? Thou hast granted me life and favour, and Thy guardianship hath preserved my spirit. <br />'For how many and of what sort were the atoms which the father of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> poured forth from himself, when he was begetting <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>? And when deposited in his mother's womb, how did they coalesce, and take shape, and form, and motion, and growth? And how did that small drop, after calling together the atoms of <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> in abundance, make some of them into skin and flesh for a covering, and how was it raised erect by others turned into bone, and by others bound together with a contexture of sinews? <br />'And how did it adapt the many other limbs, and organs, and entrails, and instruments of sense, some within and some without, by which the body was quickened into life? For among these no idle nor useless part was added, no, not even the meanest, neither hair, nor nails, but all contribute, some to the benefit of the constitution, and others to the beauty of the appearance. <br />'For Providence is careful not only of usefulness, but also of beauty. For while the hair of the head is a protection and a covering for all, the beard is a comely ornament for the philosopher. The nature also of the whole human body Providence composed of parts, all of which were necessary, and invested all the members with their mutual connexion, and measured out from the whole their due supply. <br />'As to the most important of these members, it is evident even to the simple from their experience what force they have: there is the supreme power of the head, and around the brain, as enthroned in the citadel, is the attendant guard of the senses: the eyes going on in advance, the ears bringing back reports, the taste, as it were, collecting provisions, the smell tracing out and examining, and the touch arranging everything that is subject to it. (For at present we shall only run over in a summary manner a few of the works of the all-wise Providence, intending soon, if God permit, to complete the task more carefully, when we are directing our efforts against him who is thought more learned.) <br />'Then there is the ministry of the hands, by which all kinds of workmanship and inventive arts are perfected, separately endowed with their particular facilities for co-operation in one and the same work, the strength of the shoulders in bearing burdens, the grasp of the fingers, the joints of the elbows both turning inward towards the body and bending outwards, that they may be able both to draw things in and thrust them off. The service of the feet, by which the whole terrestrial creation comes under our power, the land to tread on, the sea to sail, the rivers to cross, and communication of all things with all. The belly, a store-room of food, meting out from itself in due measure the provisions for all the members associated with it, and ejecting what is superfluous: and all the other parts whereby the administration of the human constitution has been manifestly contrived, and of which the wise and foolish alike possess the use but not the knowledge. <br />'For the wise refer the administration to whatever deity they suppose to be most perfect in all knowledge and most beneficent towards themselves, being convinced that it is the work of superior wisdom and power truly divine; while the others inconsiderately refer the most marvellous work of beauty to a chance meeting and coincidence of the atoms. <br />'Now though the still more effectual consideration of these subjects, and the arrangement of the internal parts of the body, have been accurately investigated by physicians, who in their astonishment made a god of nature, yet let us hereafter make a re-examination as well as we may be able, even though it be superficial. <br />'Now in a general and summary way I ask who made this whole tabernacle such as it is, lofty, erect, of fine proportion, keenly sensitive, graceful in motion, strong in action, fit for every kind of work? The irrational multitude of atoms, say they. Why, they could not come together and mould an image of clay, nor polish a statue of marble, nor produce by casting an idol of silver or gold; but men have been the inventors of arts and manufactures of these materials for representing the body. <br />'And if representations and pictures could not be made without intelligence, how can the real originals of the same have been spontaneous accidents? <br />'Whence too have soul, and mind, and reason been implanted in the philosopher? Did he beg them from the atoms which have no soul, nor mind, nor reason, and did each of them inspire him with some thought and doctrine? <br />'And was the wisdom of man brought to perfection by the atoms, in the same way as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>'s fable says that <a href=/people/1765 target=_blank>Pandora</a> was by the gods? Will the Greeks also cease to say that all poetry, and all music, and astronomy, and geometry, and the other sciences are inventions and instructions of the gods, and have the Atomic <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> alone been skilful and wise in all things?

For example, in the beginning of his Suggestions he says: Men formed an image of chance as an excuse for their own folly: for chance is by nature antagonistic to judgement: and this worst enemy of wisdom they said ruled over it; or rather they utterly overthrow and annihilate this latter, and set up the other in its place: for they praise not wisdom as fortunate, but fortune as most wise. <br />'Whereas therefore the masters of those works which are beneficial to life take pride in the help which they render to their fellow men, and desire praise and fame for the works in which they labour for their good, some in providing food, others as pilots, some as physicians, and some as statesmen, philosophers proudly boast of their efforts to instruct mankind. <br />'Or will <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> or <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> dare to say that they distress themselves by their pursuit of philosophy? Nay, there is no other gladness of heart that they would prefer to this. For even though they think that good consists in pleasure, yet they will be ashamed to say that philosophy is not more pleasant to them. <br />'But as to the gods of whom their poets sing as Givers of good things, these philosophers with mocking reverence say, The gods are neither givers nor partakers of any good things. In what way then do they show evidence of the existence of gods, if they neither see them present and doing something, as those who in admiration of the sun and moon and stars said that they were called gods (θεούς) because of their running (θεειν), nor assign to them any work of creation or arrangement, that they might call them gods from setting (θεῖναι), that is making (for in this respect in truth the Creator and Artificer of the universe alone is God), nor exhibit any administration, or judgement, or favour of theirs towards mankind, that we should owe them fear or honour, and therefore worship them? <br />'Or did <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> peep out from the world, and pass beyond the compass of the heavens, or go out through some secret gates known only to himself, and behold the gods dwelling in the void, and deem them and their abundant luxury blessed? And did he thence become a devotee of pleasure, and an admirer of their life in the void, and so exhort all who are to be made like unto those gods to participate in this blessing, commending as a happy banqueting hall for them, not heaven or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, as the poets did, but the void, and setting before them their ambrosia made out of the atoms, and pledging them in nectar from the same? <br />'And moreover he inserts in his own books countless oaths and adjurations addressed to those who are nothing to us, swearing continually No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and Yes, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and adjuring his readers and opponents in argument in the name of the gods, having, I suppose, no fear himself of perjury nor trying to frighten them, but uttering this as an empty, and false, and idle, and unmeaning appendage to his speeches, just as he might hawk and spit, and turn his face, and wave his hand. Such an unintelligible and empty piece of acting on his part was his mentioning the name of the gods. <br />'This however was evident, that after the death of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> he was afraid of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and that he might not seem to be what he really was, an atheist, he played the charlatan and painted for them some empty shadows of unsubstantial gods. For he neither looked up to heaven with eyes of intelligence, that he might hear the clear voice from above, which the attentive observer did hear, and testified that The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth the work of His hands, nor did he with his understanding look upon the ground, for he would have learned that The earth is full of the mercy of the Lord, and that The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof. For the Scripture says, After this also the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with His blessings. With the soul of every living thing He covered the face thereof.' <br />'And if they are not utterly blind, let them survey the vast and varied multitude of living beings, land and water animals, and birds, and let them take note how true has been the testimony of the Lord in the judgement which He passed on all His works, And all appeared good according to His command. </p>                        </div>

As to those who came after them, and then repeated their statements, we may put them aside altogether, and especially those who have not even read their books, but invent for themselves, of which kind are those who say that he had three hundred dishes: for nobody could be found among his contemporaries, except <a href=/people/1009 target=_blank>Lycon</a>, who has said any such thing about him. He, however, has said, as I mentioned before, that there were seventy-five plates found. <br />'But not only from the dates and from the persons who have reviled him might one infer that all the things that have been stated are false, but also from the fact that they do not all bring the same charges, but each says some things of his own: in which if there was any one word of truth, he deserved surely to have been put to death by his contemporaries not once only but ten thousand times. <br />'It is manifest therefore that it has happened to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, as to many others, to be envied by the Sophists of his time, both for his friendships with kings, and for his superiority in argument. But those who are right-minded must look not only to the detractors, but also to those who praise and emulate him: for these will be found much more in number and in worth. <br />'Now all the other stories are manifestly invented: but credit seems to be given to these two things for which some blame him; one, that he married <a href=/people/1757 target=_blank>Pythias</a>, who was by birth the sister, and by adoption the daughter, of <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a>, to flatter him.

Or what, if you distribute them with less division, and say that of good things some are ends, and some are not ends, and call those ends, for the sake of which the others are taken, and not ends those which are taken for the sake of others? <br />'Or what, if one were taught, that some are absolutely good, and others not good for all?

But he who puts aside this divine nature, and cuts off the soul's hope of hereafter, and destroys reverence before superior Beings in the present life, what communion has he with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>? Or how could he exhort men to what <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> desires, and confirm his sayings? For on the contrary he surely would appear as the helper and ally of those who wish to do injustice. For every one who is human and constrained by human desires, if he despise the gods and think they are nothing to him, inasmuch as in life he dwells far away from them, and after death exists no more, will come prepared to gratify his lusts. <br />'For it is not impossible to feel assurance of being undetected in wrong-doing, if indeed it be necessary to avoid detection by men: it is not necessary, however, on every occasion even to seek to avoid detection, where a man has power to overmaster those who have discovered him. So the disbelief in providence is a ready way to wrong-doing. <br />'For a very worthy person indeed is he, who after holding out pleasure to us as a good, and granting us security from the gods, still thinks to provide a plan to prevent wrong-doing. He acts like a physician who, having neglected to give help while the sick man was yet alive, attempts after death to devise certain contrivances for curing the dead man. <br />'In a similar manner to him the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> acts. For it is not so much the eagerness for the pleasure, as the disbelief that the deity cares, that encourages wrong-doing. What then, some one may say, do you put <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> in the same class with <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>? <br />'Why certainly, at least in relation to the point before us. For what difference does it make to us, whether you banish deity from the world and leave us no communion therewith, or shut up the gods in the world and remove them from all share in the affairs of earth? For in both cases the indifference of the gods towards men is equal, and equal also the security of wrong-doers from fear of the gods. And as to our deriving any benefit from them while they remain in heaven, in the first place this is common also to things without reason or life, and further, in this way, even according to <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, men get help from the gods, 'They say, for instance, that the better emanations from them become the causes of great blessings to those who partake of them. But neither <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> nor <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> can rightly be reckoned on the side of providence. For if according to <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> providence disappears, although the gods according to him employ the utmost solicitude for the preservation of their own goods, so must providence disappear according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> also, even if the heavenly motions are arranged in a certain order and array. <br />'For we seek a providence that has an interest for us, and in such that man has no share who has admitted that neither daemons, nor heroes, nor any souls at all can live on hereafter. <br />'But therein <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, in my judgement, seems to have acted more modestly: for as if he despaired of the gods being able to abstain from the care of mankind if they came in contact with them, he transferred them, as it were, to a foreign country, and settled them somewhere outside the world, excusing them from the charge of inhumanity by the removal, and by their separation from all things. <br />'But this our super-excellent discoverer of nature, and accurate judge of things divine, after putting human affairs under the very eyes of the gods yet left them uncared for and unregarded, being administered by some force of nature, and not by divine reason. Wherefore he himself cannot fairly escape that other charge which some imagine against <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, that it was not according to his judgement, but through fear of men, that he allotted room in the universe to the gods, just like a spectator's place in a theatre. <br />'And they regard it as a proof of. the man's opinion, that he deprived the gods of their activity towards us, from which alone a just confidence in their existence was likely to be derived. For this same thing is done by <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> also; for by his both putting them far off and giving over the proof to sight only, an operation too feeble to judge of things at so great a distance, it may readily be thought that from shame he admits the existence of gods there. <br />'For as he neither left anything outside the world, nor gave his gods access to things on earth, he was compelled either to confess himself altogether an atheist, or to preserve the appearance of allowing gods to remain, by banishing his gods to some such place as that. But <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, by excusing the higher powers from diligent care because of the want of communication, seems to throw a decent veil over his disbelief in the gods.' </p>                        </div>

For they are bound in justice to pardon us, if in reference to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s opinions we believe what he himself, being a Greek, has discoursed to us Greeks in clear and distinct language. <br />For God, says he, having found the whole visible world not at rest, but moving in an irregular and disorderly manner, brought it out of disorder into order, because He thought that this was altogether better than the other. And still more plainly he shows that he did not adopt creation in an enigmatic way, nor yet for need of clearness, in the discourse which he has made the Father of all hold upon this point after the creation of the universe. <br />For, says he, since ye have come into being, (and he is speaking to the gods) though ye are not altogether immortal nor indissoluble, nevertheless ye shall certainly not be dissolved, since ye have gained my will. <br />'But, as I was saying, with those who talk to us at home, as being our friends, we will discuss the matter in a friendly way and quietly with gentle arguments. For <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> seems to have brought them also over, as haying been unable to resist his attack upon the doctrine, and unwilling to impute to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> what seemed to have been detected as a fallacy. <br />'But according to our hearing, whereas <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> claims for the world that it is the noblest work made by the noblest of Creators, and invests the Maker of all with a power by which He made the world which did not previously exist, and haying made it, will if He please preserve it ever in safety, and whereas according to him the world is in this way supposed to be created and imperishable, who among the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetics</a> gives us any confirmation of these doctrines? <br />'We must gently admonish their ally, that it is not absolutely necessary that whatever has been created must also perish, nor conversely that what will never perish must necessarily be uncreated. For we must neither admit that the sole cause of the imperishable is derived from its being uncreated, nor must we leave the passing of the created to destruction as admitting no remedy. <br />'Whence then are we to get any help on these points from the doctrines of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, a man who pursues the argument on these subjects, not indirectly, nor merely as stating his own opinion, but sets himself in direct opposition to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and both brings the created under a necessity of perishing, and says that what is imperishable maintains its imperishable condition only from the fact of not having been created, nor even leaves any power in God, which He can use to do any good. For what has never existed before now, this, he says, never can come into existence. <br />'And so far is he from supporting <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s doctrine by these statements, that he has ere now frightened some even of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s zealous disciples by what he said, and led them to reject his doctrine, because they were not able to perceive, that although, according to the nature of things alone without the will and power of God, neither the created is imperishable nor the imperishable created. <br />'Yet when one has established as the chief cause that which proceeds from God, one must take this as guide in all things, and show it to be a cause on no point inferior to any others. For it is ridiculous that, because a thing has come into existence, it must therefore perish, and yet not perish, if God so wills; ridiculous also that, because a thing is uncreated, it has strength to escape from perishing, and yet that the will of God is insufficient to keep any created thing from perishing. <br />'The builder is able to set up a house not yet existent, and a man can make a statue not previously existent, and another frames a ship out of unwrought timber and gives it over to those who want it, and all the other artificers, who pursue the constructive arts, have this power to bring some non-existent thing into existence; and shall the universal King and Chief Artificer not so much as share the power of a human artificer, but be left by us without any share in creation? Not so, if at least we be able in any small degree to form an estimate of a divine cause. <br />'But though competent to create and to will what is excellent, (for He is good, and the good feels no envy about anything), is He yet unable to preserve and guard what He has made? Yet surely even the other artificers are competent to do both. The builder, for instance, and the shipwright not only build new ships and houses, but are able also to repair those which are wearing away from time, substituting in them other parts in place of those which have been damaged. <br />'So that surely so much as this must be conceded to God also. For how can He who is able to make a whole thing be unable to make it in part? So then why need it be made new, if one who is a maker in general is also to preserve his beautiful work against every accident? For to be willing to undo what was well made is the part of an evil one. <br />'But there is no stronger bond for the preservation of things created than the will of God. Or, while many things which shared in the zeal and will of man, as nations and cities and works, after existing an enormous time still remain when he who willed them is no more, shall the things which have had a share in God's purpose, and have been made for Him and by Him, — shall these then pass away and no longer remain while their Maker is still present? <br />'What cause can have done violence to the purpose of God? Can it be the necessity proceeding from the things created themselves? But this by accepting the orderly arrangement confessed itself overcome by God. But can it be some cause from without acting in antagonism to God? Yet neither does any such cause exist, nor is it right to make God inferior to any in matters in which He has before prevailed and made order, unless indeed we altogether forget that we are discoursing about the greatest and most divine power. <br />'But enough, for perhaps we are carried away by zeal into this argument concerning the truth. One thing is plain which we set forth, that they can be no teachers concerning the creation of the world who do not allow it any creation at all.' </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, as it seems, hoped to appear extraordinarily wise, if he could add another body, and counted in with the four visible bodies the fifth essence: and he thus made a very brilliant and bountiful use of nature, but failed to observe that in physical inquiry one must not lay down laws, but search out nature's own facts. <br />'To the proof then that the primary natures of bodies are four, which is what the Platonists want, the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> would not only give no help, but would even be almost its only opponent. For instance, when we say that every body is either hot or cold, or moist or dry, or soft or hard, or light or heavy, or rare or dense, and when we find that there can be nothing else to partake of any of these conditions besides the four elements, — for if anything is hot, it is either fire or air; and if cold, either water or earth; and if dry, fire or earth; and if moist, water or air; and if soft, air or fire; and if hard, water or earth; and light and rare, as for instance, fire and air; and heavy and dense, as water and earth; — and when from all the other simple forces we perceive that there cannot be any other body besides these, this man alone opposes us, asserting that there can be a body which partakes not of these, a body, that is, neither heavy nor light, neither soft nor hard, neither moist nor dry, almost calling it a body that is not a body. For though he has left it the name, he has taken away all the forces by means of which it naturally becomes a body. <br />'Either, therefore, he will withdraw us from <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s opinion by persuading us of his own statements, or by confirming those of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> he will himself withdraw from his own opinions. So that in no way is he of any use in regard to <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s doctrines. <br />'Further, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> will have it that all bodies, inasmuch as they are regarded as formed upon one similar kind of matter, turn and change one into another. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> claims absolutely an essence in all other things which is impassible, and imperishable, and unchangeable, lest forsooth he should seem to be the inventor of something contemptible: yet he says nothing at all extraordinary and original, but transfers <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s fine intuitions in other matters to such as are unsuitable, just like some of the more modern sculptors. <br />'For they too, when they have copied the head of one statue, and the breast of another, and the waist of another, sometimes put together things which do not suit each other, and persuade themselves that they have made something original: and indeed the whole, which any one would blame as being unsymmetrical, is their own; but the contributions which are brought together in it, and have some beauty, are not theirs. <br />'In like manner also <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> hearing from <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> that there is a certain essence intelligible in itself abstractedly, and incorporeal colourless and intangible, neither coming into being, nor perishing, nor turning, nor changing, but always existing in the same conditions and manner, and hearing again at another time of the things in heaven that being divine and imperishable and impassible they are yet bodies, he combined out of both and stuck together things not at all congruous: for from the one he took the property of body, and from the others the property of impassibility, and so framed an impassible body. <br />'In the case then of the statues, even if the combination of the different parts was not beautiful, it was at least not impossible to be made. For instance, even <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> shows us such combinations, for he says,In eyes and head Like <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the Lord of thunder, with the girth <br />Of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, and <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>'s brawny chest. </p>                        </div>

For the one says that the things in heaven have most of their character from fire, while the other says that the heavenly bodies have nothing to do with fire. And <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says that God kindled light in the second circle from the earth in order that it might as much as possible illumine the whole heaven, such being his declaration concerning the sun. But the other, not willing that the sun should be fire, and knowing that light is pure fire, or something of fire, does not allow that light is kindled round the sun. <br />'Further, the one, attributing formal immortality to all the heavenly bodies, says that there take place certain secretions from them and equivalent accessions; and he is compelled to say this, in regard to the secretions, by the rays of the sun and the heat produced in the efflux from him; and, in regard to the accessions, by the equality in his apparent magnitude: for the bodies would not appear equal if they received nothing in place of what they emit: 'but <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> maintains that they continue altogether the same in substance, without either any secretion from them or any accretion. <br />'Further, the one, in addition to the common motion of the heavenly bodies, in which all move in the spheres to which they are confined, both the fixed stars and the planets, gives them another motion also, which indeed happens to be otherwise most admirable, and congenial to the nature of their body; for as they are spherical, naturally each would have a spherical motion of rotation: but the other deprives them of this motion also, which they perform as living beings, and leaves them only the motion which results from other bodies surrounding them, as if they were without life. <br />'Moreover he says that the appearance presented to us by the stars as if they were in motion is an affection of the feebleness and quivering, as it were, of our sight, and is not a reality: as if <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> derived his belief in their motion from this appearance, and not from the reason which teaches that as each of these is a living being, and has both soul and body, it must necessarily have its own proper motion (for every body whose motion is from without is lifeless, but that which is moved from within and of itself is animated); and when moved, as being divine, it must move with the most beautiful motion, and since motion in a circle is the most beautiful, it must move in this way. <br />'And the truth of the sensation would be in part confirmed by the testimony of reason; it was not, however, this sensation that caused the belief in the motion. With regard to the motion of the whole, he could not contradict <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s assertion that it takes place in a circle, for he was overpowered by the clear evidence: yet here also this fine invention of the new body gave him room for dissent. <br />'For whereas <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> attributed the circular motion to the soul, inasmuch as there were four bodies and all naturally moved in a simple and straight course, fire towards the outside, and earth towards the centre, and the others towards the intervening space, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, as assigning a different motion to each different body, so also assigned the circular as a sort of bodily motion to his fifth body, easily deceiving himself in all. <br />'For to bodies which move in a straight line their heaviness or lightness supplied a source of motion; but the fifth body, partaking neither of heaviness nor lightness, was rather a cause of immobility, and not of motion in a circle. <br />'For if to bodies that move in a straight line the cause of their motion is not their shape, but the inclination of their weight, a body, not only when placed in the centre of any like body, will have no inclination in any direction, but, also, when set in a circle round any kind of body whatever, will have no cause of inclination towards anything, <br />Move they to right towards the rising sun, <br />Or move to left, whether forward or backward. <br />'Further, when other bodies have been thrust out of their proper places, the rebound towards these gives them a motion again of themselves; but as that fifth body never departs from its own localities, it ought to remain at rest. <br />'And with regard to the other bodies, when this fifth is put out of the question, it is evident that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> out of contentiousness does not agree with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. For <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> had inquired whether body, is heavy by nature or light by nature, and, since it was evident that these terms are used according to the relation towards up and down, he had considered whether there is by nature any up and down or not, and had exactly shown that according to the affinities of the bodies to their places, the direction towards which they severally tended would be called down, and the other direction from which each would draw back be called up. And heavy and light he disposed according to the same relation, and further proved that neither their centre nor their circumference is rightly called up or down. But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> makes objection, thinking that he must overthrow the other's doctrines on every side, and urges us to call that which tends to the centre heavy, and that which tends to the circumference light, and the place in the centre he calls down, and the circumference up.

For all kinds of learning are recollections, and he thinks that in no other way can inquiry and learning, out of which science springs, be maintained. <br />'Now if the soul is not immortal, neither is recollection, and if not this, then neither learning. Whereas therefore all the doctrines of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> are absolutely attached to and dependent on the divine nature of the soul and its immortality, he who does not admit this overthrows <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s whole philosophy. <br />'Who then first attempted to oppose the proofs, and rob the soul of immortality and all its other power? Who else, I say, before <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>?

For see how he ventured, or even was forced, so far as to rob the soul of its primary motions, deliberation, thought, expectation, remembrance, reasoning! <br />'For this secretary, as they say, of nature says that these are not movements of the soul. Surely this man may be quite trusted to have understood anything about the things outside him, who has made so great a mistake about his own soul, as not even to understand that it thinks! For it is not the soul, he says, but the man that performs each of these acts, while the soul is motionless. <br />'<a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> therefore following him, and being able to discern the consequence, took away the whole substance of the soul. It is manifest indeed that the soul is a thing invisible and concealed, so that, through the clear evidence at least of our senses, we could not grant its existence: but though concealed, its motions seem to compel us to acknowledge that the soul is an existent thing. <br />'For almost every one seems to understand that the following are acts of the soul: to deliberate, to consider, and to think in any way whatever. For when we behold the body and its powers, and reflect that actions of this kind are not proper to the body, we grant the existence within us of something else which deliberates, and that this is the soul. Since from what other source came our belief concerning soul? <br />'If therefore any one take away these acts which are the chief evidences of the soul, and assign them to something else, he has neither left us any evidence of its existence, nor any purpose for which it would seem to be of use. What help therefore can he who would have the soul to be immortal derive from him that deals death to the soul? And what is the explanation of the manner of its motion, according to which we call it self-moved, to be obtained from those who attribute to it no motion at all? <br />'True; but in regard to the immortality of the mind some one may say that <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> agrees with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. For though he will not admit the whole soul to be immortal, yet he acknowledges the mind at least to be divine and imperishable. What therefore the mind is in its essence and its nature, whence it comes, and from what source it separates itself and enters into man's nature, and whither it departs again, himself alone may know; if at least he understands anything that he says about the mind, and is not avoiding the proof by wrapping up the difficulty of the matter in the obscurity of his language, and, just like the cuttle-fish, making it difficult to catch him by means of the darkness he creates. 'But even in these matters he is altogether at variance with <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. For the one says that mind cannot subsist without a soul, while the other separates the mind from the soul. And immortality the one gives to it in partnership with the soul, as being otherwise impossible; but the other says that this survives in the mind alone when separated from the soul. And that the soul goes forth from the body he would not allow, because this thought pleased <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>: but he insisted that the mind is severed from the soul, because <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> judged such a thing as this impossible.' </p>                        </div>

The soul, they say, holds in the combination the place of form, in relation to the body when alive as matter: but it is the form not of every body, nor of body as such, but as physical, organic, and potentially alive. <br />'If therefore it is like that with which it has been compared, it is as the form of a statue to the bronze: and if the body is divided, the soul must be divided into parts with it, and if any part is cut off from the body, a portion of the soul is with the part cut off; and the supposed withdrawal of the soul in sleep does not take place, since the entelechy must be inseparable from that to which it belongs; but in reality there is no such thing as sleep. <br />'Moreover if there is an entelechy, there can be no opposition between reason and desires, but the whole must be affected throughout in one and the same way, without any self-discord. But sensations may possibly exist only contingently, while perceptions cannot: wherefore they themselves also introduce the mind as another soul, and suppose it immortal. <br />'The reasoning soul therefore must be an entelechy, if we must use this term, in some other way than this. Nor will the sensitive soul, since this also retains the impressions of the sensible objects when absent, retain them without the body's aid: otherwise, they will be in it just like forms and images: but if they were therein in this manner, it would be impossible to receive them otherwise (than with the body's aid). Therefore, it is not an entelechy as being inseparable. <br />'Moreover that which desires not meats or drinks, but other than bodily things, is not itself an inseparable entelechy. <br />'Then there would remain the vegetative principle, which would seem to admit a doubt, whether it be in this way an inseparable entelechy. Yet even this seems not to be so. For if the beginning of every plant is at the root, and the rest of the body grows round the root and the lower parts in many plants, it is evident that the soul forsakes the other parts and is collected in some one: it is not then in the whole as an inseparable entelechy. For again, before the plant grows the soul is in a little germ: if therefore it both comes from a larger plant into a small germ, and from a small germ into a whole plant, what is to hinder its being also wholly separated? And how, being also indivisible can it become a divisible entelechy of a divisible body? <br />'Also the same soul from one animal becomes another: how then could the soul of the former become the soul of the next, if it were the entelechy of one? And this is evident from the animals which change into other animals. The soul then has not its existence from being the form of anything, but is an essence, not receiving its existence in consequence of its abode in a body, but existing before it belonged to this, so that in an animal the body will not generate the soul. <br />'What then is its essence? And if it is neither body, nor an affection of body, but action and production and many such things are both in it and from it, being an essence in addition to its bodies, what is its nature? Must it not manifestly be what we call real essence? For all that is bodily may be said to be generation but not substance, becoming and perishing, and never really being, but preserved by participation with being, so far as it may partake thereof.' </p>                        </div>

But of properties pertaining to the soul not a trace nor a sign is found in bodies, not even if one should strive, like <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> and <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>, to turn every stone, and examine every power of body for an origin of the functions of the soul. <br />'For what help would the subtilty of the breath give us for sensible presentations and reasonings? Or why has the shape of the atoms so great power above all else and such facility of change, as to beget wisdom, whenever it is mixed up in the moulding of another body? I think indeed that not even if one chanced to be one of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>' tripods and handmaidens, of whom the former, <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says, went self-moved to the assembly, and the latter helped their master in his work, and lacked none of the advantages which living beings possess, much less those of the fortuitous motes, . . . and on the other hand it is like the stones upon the sea-shore, in regard to being able to do anything remarkable towards producing sensation. For one might justly be indignant with <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> and <a href=/people/561 target=_blank>Cleanthes</a> for arguing so very contemptuously about the soul, and saying both alike that the soul is an exhalation of the solid body. For what, in heaven's name, is there at all in common between an exhalation and a soul? And how is it possible for them, if they think that both our nature and that of other animals is like this, to be able to preserve either sensible presentations and remembrances permanently, or, on the other hand, instincts and desires of things conducive to understanding? Shall we then indeed degrade the gods also, and Him who pervades all things alike in earth and heaven, into an exhalation, and smoke, and such nonsense as this? And shall we not feel ashamed even towards the poets, who although they have not an exact understanding of the gods, nevertheless partly from the common conception of mankind, and partly from inspiration of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, which is of a nature to stir them hereto, have spoken more honourably concerning them, and not called them exhalations, or airs, or breaths, and such nonsense?' </p>                        </div>

But the dominant part, even the man himself, would be either like the form in relation to the body as matter, or like the agent in relation to an instrument. And in either way the soul is the self. <br />'Of what nature then is this? Either it is body, and must certainly be soluble, for every body is compound. Or if it were not body, but of some other nature, this also we must examine either in the same way or some other. And first we must consider into what this body, which they say is soul, must be resolved. <br />'For since life is an inseparable property of soul, this body which is the soul, if it consisted of two or more bodies, must either in each of the two or in every one have life innate, or one must have it and the other not, or neither have it. If then the life were attached to one of them only, this itself would be soul. <br />'What then would a body be, which derived life from itself? For fire, and air, and water, and earth, are without life from. themselves: and to whichever of these soul is attached, the life which this one enjoys is adventitious. But besides these there are no other bodies. And by those who think that there are elements different from these, they were not said to be souls but bodies, and not to have life. But if, though none of them has life, the assemblage of them is said to have produced life, this is absurd. <br />'If, however, each has life, even one is sufficient: but rather it is impossible that a collection of bodies should produce life, and things unintelligent beget intelligence. Moreover they will not assert that these are produced by any and every mode of combination. There must then be the power that is to arrange, and the cause of the combination: so that this would hold the place of a soul. <br />'For there would not be even a simple body, to say nothing of a composite body, in the world of being, if there were not a soul in the universe; since it is the accession of reason to matter that makes body, and reason can come from no other source than soul.; 'If any one should deny this, and say that a soul is made by a concurrence of atoms or indivisibles, he would be refuted by its oneness and community of feeling, and by analogy, since there can be no unity that does not extend throughout the whole, nor can a common feeling come from bodies which are without feeling and incapable of union; but the soul is conscious of feeling; also from things which have no parts there can come neither body nor magnitude. </p>                        </div>

For certainly the matter does not give itself form, nor infuse into itself a soul. There must, then, be something which provides life, whether it be provided for the matter or for any of the bodies, and this must be outside and beyond any bodily nature. Since otherwise there would not even be any body, as there would be no animal force. <br />'For its own nature is in flux and motion, and if all were bodies they would perish very speedily, even though the name soul should be given to one of them: for it would be affected in the same way as the other bodies, they all having the same matter. Or rather nothing would ever come into being, but all things would remain as matter, if there were nothing to give it form. <br />'But perhaps even matter would not exist at all, but this universe would be dissolved, if any one should entrust it to a combination of body, giving it in mere name the rank of soul, though it is only air and breath that is most easily dispersed, and has no unity of itself. For since all bodies are capable of division, how can any one who makes this universe depend on any of them, fail to make it unintelligent and moved at random? <br />'For what order, or reason, or mind can there be in breath which needs a soul to give it order? But granted the existence of a soul, all these are subservient to it for the constitution of a world and of every living thing, a different power from each contributing to the whole: whereas if there be no soul present in the universals, they will not merely be without order, but will be nothing at all. <br />'These men are also themselves led by the truth to testify that there must be something prior to bodies and superior to them, a species of soul, since they suppose that breath is endowed with mind and that fire is intelligent, as without fire and breath the better part cannot exist in the actual world, but seeks a place where it may be settled; whereas they ought to be seeking where to settle the bodies, as it seems these must be settled in powers of the soul. <br />'But if they assume that life and soul are nothing besides breath, what becomes of their much boasted phrase in a certain state, in which they take refuge when compelled to assume some active nature besides bodies? If then they say that not every breath is soul, because countless breaths are inanimate, but the breath that is in a certain state, they must say that this certain state, and this condition, is either something real or nothing. <br />'But if they say it is nothing, there will be breath only, and the certain state a mere name: and so it will result in their saying that nothing else exists but matter, and that soul, and god, and all things are a mere name, and that matter alone exists. But if the state is something real and additional to the substratum and the matter, existing in matter but itself immaterial because it is not compounded again out of matter, it must be not body, but a kind of reason, and a different nature. <br />'Moreover from the following considerations it is not less evidently impossible that the soul should be a body of any kind whatever. For then it must be either hot or cold, either hard or soft, and liquid or solid, and black or white, with all other bodily qualities differing in different bodies. And if it is hot, it will only give heat, if cold it will only chill, and the additional presence of lightness will make things light, and of heaviness heavy, and blackness will make black, and whiteness white. <br />'For it is no property of fire to chill, nor of cold to make hot. But the soul both produces different effects in different animals, and also contrary effects in the same animal; making some parts solid and others liquid, and some thick and others thin, black and white, light and heavy. Yet it ought to have produced only one effect according to the quality of the body in colour and other respects: but in fact it produces many. </p>                        </div>

If they allege choice as cause of some motions, natural laws of others, so far they are right: but choice is not a property of body, nor laws, at least if they are different, while the body is one and simple, and has no participation in any such law, except what has been given to it by that which caused it to be hot or cold. <br />'Also the power of causing growth in periods of time and up to this or that measurer — whence can the body itself get this? For it is natural to it to be increased, but to have no power in itself of causing increase, except in as far as it may be taken into service as a mass of matter by the power which by means of it effects the increase. Even if the soul were a body and caused increase, it must also be itself increased by an addition evidently of similar body, if it is to advance equally with that which receives increase from it. And the addition will either be soul, or soulless body. <br />'And if soul, how and whence does it come in, and how is it added? But if the addition is soulless, how is it to become animated, and to agree with what was there before, and be one with it, and share the same opinions with the first soul? Will not rather this soul, as a stranger, be in ignorance of what the other knows; and just as with the other mass of our body, one part will pass away from it, and another be added, and nothing will be the same? <br />'How then are our remembrances formed? And how our knowledge of our own selves, if we have never the same soul? Moreover if it is body, and the nature of body is that, when divided into several parts, each of the parts is not the same as the whole, and if a soul is of a certain size, then whatever is less than that will not be soul, just as everything of a certain size by any subtraction changes from being what it was. <br />'But if anything possessing magnitude should remain the same in quality when diminished in bulk, it is altered as body and as quantity, but may retain its sameness in quality as being different from quantity. <br />'What then will they say, who assert that the soul is body? <br />'First as to each part of the soul that is in the same body, is each a soul such as the whole is? <br />'And so again the part of each part? Magnitude then contributed nothing to its essence; yet it ought to have done so, as there was, a certain fixed quantity; and it was whole in many different places, which cannot be the case with body, that the same should be whole in many places, and the part be the same as the whole. <br />'But if they say that each of the parts is not a soul, they will have a soul consisting of soulless parts. And further still, if the magnitude of each soul be limited in each direction, then if it become either less or greater it will not be a soul. <br />'Whenever therefore from one connexion and the same seed twin children are begotten, or even many, as in the case of the other animals, the seed being parted into several places, where each is a whole, does not this teach those who are willing to learn, that where the part is the same as the whole, this whole in its own essence transcends the quantitative existence, and must itself be without quantity? For thus it will remain the same when quantity is withdrawn, inasmuch as it is independent of quantity and bulk, as its essence is something different therefrom. The soul therefore and its laws are independent of quantity. <br />'But that, if the soul were body, there would be neither sensation nor thought, nor knowledge, nor virtues, nor anything noble, is evident from the following reasons. Whatever is to perceive anything by sensation must itself be one, and must apprehend everything by the same sentient power; even if there should be many impressions that enter through many organs of sensation, or many qualities of one thing, and even if through one sense there should enter a complex object, such as a face. <br />'For there are not different powers that perceive the nostril and the eye, but the same perceives all at once. And if one impression comes through the eyes, and another through hearing, there must be some one power which both reach: or how could one say that these are different, if the sensations did not reach the same sentient power at the same time? This, therefore, must be as it were a centre, and lines converging from the circumference of the circle must convey the sensations from all sides to it, and the percipient power of this kind must be really and truly one. <br />'For if this were to be extended, and the sensations were to strike upon both extremities, as it were, of a line, either they must run together again to one and the same point, as the centre, or to some other: and each different point will have a sensation of one of the two objects, just as if I were to perceive one object and you another. </p>                        </div>

And this faculty will be indivisible, or, if it were a magnitude, the perceptions would share its divisibility, so that one part (of the soul) would perceive one part (of the object), and another another, and nothing in us would perceive the sensible object as a whole. <br />'But in fact the whole sentient is one: for how could it be divided? For there can be no correspondence of equal to equal, because the ruling faculty cannot be equal to each and every sensible object. Into how many parts then shall the division be made? Or shall it be divided into as many parts as the number of varieties in the object of sense that enters? And so then each of those parts of the soul will also perceive by its subdivisions, or the parts of the subdivisions will have no perception; but that is impossible. And if any part perceive all the object, since magnitude by its nature is infinitely divisible, the result will be that each man will also have infinite sensations for each sensible object, infinite images, as it were, of the same thing in our ruling faculty. <br />'Moreover if the sentient be body, the sensation cannot take place otherwise than as seals impressed on wax from signet-rings, whether the sensations be impressed upon the blood or upon the breath. If then the impressions are made as in liquid bodies, which is probable, they will become confused, just as if made on water, and there will be no remembrance of them. <br />'But if the impressions remain, either it is impossible for others to be imprinted while the former occupy the place, so that there will be no other sensations: or if others are made, the former will be obliterated, so that the remembrance will come to nothing. But if it is possible to remember, and to receive sensations one upon another, without hindrance from the earlier, it is impossible for the soul to be body. <br />'And the same may also be seen from the sensation of pain. When a man is said to have a pain in his finger, the pain of course is about the finger, but the sensation of the pain, they must evidently admit, arises in the ruling faculty. While the suffering part therefore is different, the ruling faculty perceives the (animal) spirit, and the whole soul shares the same feeling. <br />'How then does this result? By transmission, they will say, the animal spirit about the finger having first suffered, and imparted the suffering to the next, and this to another, until it arrived at the ruling faculty. <br />'Necessarily, therefore, if the first had a sensation of pain, there must be another sensation for the second, if the sensation came by way of transmission, and another also for the third, and the sensation of one single pain must become many and infinite, and afterwards the ruling faculty must perceive all these sensations and its own in addition to them. <br />'But the truth is, that each of them is not a sensation of the pain in the finger, but that which is next to the finger is a feeling that the wrist is in pain, and the third is a feeling that another part farther up is in pain, and so there are many pains: and the ruling faculty does not perceive the pain in the finger, but the pain close to itself, and knows only this, and dismisses the others, not understanding that it is the finger which is in pain. <br />'If, therefore, it is not possible for the sensation of such a pain to be produced by transmission, nor possible that in the body as being a mass, when one part suffers, another part should be noticed (for in every magnitude one part and another part are different), we must suppose the sentient power to be of such a nature as to be everywhere identical with itself. But to effect this is the property of a different kind of being from body. <br />'That it would not be possible even to think, if the soul were any kind of body, is to be shown from the following reasons. For if the meaning of sensation is, that the soul apprehends the objects of sense by making use of body, it cannot be that thought also means perception by means of body, or else it will be the same as sensation. <br />'If, therefore, thought is apprehension without the aid of body, much rather must the thinking faculty not be body, since sensation is of sensibles, but thought of intelligibles. But if they will not admit this, at all events there must be both thoughts of some intelligibles, and apprehensions of things without magnitude. <br />'How, then, if it be magnitude will it conceive in thought that which is not magnitude, or by that which is divisible conceive that which is not divisible? Will it be by some indivisible part of itself? But if so, the thinking faculty will not be body. For there is certainly no need of the whole in order to touch; for any one part is sufficient. <br />'If, therefore, they should admit, as is true, that the first notions are those of the things which are most entirely free from body, that is of absolutes, the intelligent faculty can form notions only as being or becoming free from body. But if they should say that the notions are of forms embodied in matter, yet they are only formed by abstraction from the bodies, the mind making the abstraction. <br />'For certainly the abstraction of circle, and triangle, and line, and point has nothing to do with flesh, or matter at all. In such an operation, therefore, we must separate the soul itself also from body: it must not therefore itself be body. I suppose too that beauty and justice are things without magnitude, and therefore the conception of them also. So that as they occur the soul will receive them with its indivisible faculty, and they will abide in it as indivisibles. </p>                        </div>

For then temperance, or justice, or fortitude must be some kind of breath, or of blood; unless perhaps fortitude were the uneasiness of the breath, and temperance its right temperature, and beauty a certain elegance in forms, because of which, when we see them, we call men goodly and beautiful in body. <br />'To be strong and beautiful in form might indeed be suitable to breath; but what does breath want of prudence? Nay; but, on the contrary, it wants to find enjoyment in embraces and caresses, wherein it will either be warmed, or will desire a moderate coolness, or attach itself to things soft, and tender, and smooth. But for assigning to each thing its due worth, what would it care? <br />'And is it because they are eternal that the soul fastens upon the conceptions of virtue, and the other objects of the intellect, or does virtue begin to exist in one, and must it perish again? But then who creates it, and whence? For thus there would again remain that former question. It must be, then, because they are eternal and abiding, such as are the conceptions of geometry: and, if eternal and abiding, not corporeal. Therefore also the soul in which they are to exist must be of this same nature; it must not then be corporeal; for everything of the nature of body is non-abiding and transient. <br />'If, from seeing the operations of bodies, in imparting heat and cold, and thrusting, and weighing down, they put the soul in this class, as if seating it in a place of activity, — then in the first place they are ignorant that even these bodies work these effects by means of the incorporeal powers contained in them, and then that these are not the powers which we claim as belonging to the soul; but the powers of thought, sensation, reasoning, desiring, managing wisely and well, all require another kind of essence. <br />'So by transferring the powers of the incorporeal to the corporeal, they leave none for the former. And that bodies can only produce their effects by means of incorporeal powers is evident from the following reasons. For it will be admitted that quality is one thing and quantity another, and that every body has quantity, and yet not every body has quality, as for example mere matter. But if they admit this, they must admit that quality, being different from quantity, is different from body. <br />'For if it have not quantity, how can it be body, since every body has quantity? Moreover, as was said somewhere above, if every body on being divided, and every mass, ceases to be what it was, but when the body is cut small the same quality remains entire in every part, — if for example, the sweetness of honey is none the less sweetness in every drop, — sweetness cannot be a body. The same is true of all the other qualities. <br />'Then further, if the powers were bodies, the strong powers must necessarily be great masses, and those which can effect but little, small masses. But if when the masses are great the powers are small, and a few very small masses have the greatest powers, their efficacy must be attributed to something else than magnitude, therefore to something without magnitude. 'The fact too that matter, being as they say body, is itself the same, but produces different effects when it has qualities added to it, — does not this make it evident that the things added are actually rational powers and incorporeal? And let them not reply that, when breath or blood has departed, the animals die. For it is impossible to exist without many other things besides these, and yet the soul can be none of them. Moreover neither breath nor blood extends through all parts, but soul does. <br />'Further, if the soul being body had pervaded every part, it would also have been mixed, in the same way as the mixture takes place in all other bodies. But if the mixture of the bodies leaves none of the components in actual existence, neither will the soul retain an actual existence in the bodies, but only potential, having lost its existence as soul. Just as if sweet and bitter be mingled, the sweet no longer exists. And so we have no soul. <br />'And the fact that, being body, it is mingled with body, the whole throughout the whole, so that wherever either may be there the other is also, both having a mass equal to the whole, and that no increase has taken place by the addition of the other, — this will leave nothing that it does not divide. For the mixture is not made in large portions alternately (for so they say it would be a juxta-position), but having passed through the whole, the addition being superimposed upon the less (a thing impossible, that the less should be found equal to the greater) — but nevertheless having so passed through, it divides the whole in every part. <br />'Therefore if this occurs at any point whatever, and there be no body between, which has not been cut, the body must have been divided into points, which is impossible; and if the division be carried on to infinity (for whatever particle of body you take, it may be divided), the infinities will have not only a potential but an actual existence. Therefore it is not possible that body should wholly pervade the whole: but the soul does pervade the whole: therefore it is incorporeal. <br />'As to their saying that the same breath is an earlier nature, and when it has come into a cool place (ψυχρῷ) and been sharpened, it becomes soul (ψυχή), being made finer in the cool, — this certainly is absurd; for many animals are born in warm places, and have a soul that has not been cooled. But at all events they say that there is an earlier nature of the soul produced by external contingencies. The result, therefore, is that they make the inferior first, and before this another still less, which they call habit (ἕξις). And the mind comes last, as produced of course from the soul; or if mind is before all things, they ought to make soul next, then vegetative nature; and the later always the worse, if it is a merely natural product. <br />'If, therefore, even God in respect of His mind is regarded by them as later, and as generated, His intelligence also being adscititious, it would be possible that neither soul, nor mind, nor God should exist. For if the potential could exist without the previous existence of the actual, and of mind, it would never attain to actuality. For what would there be to bring it on, if there exist not besides itself something prior? But if it is to bring itself into actuality (which is absurd), yet at least in so bringing itself forward it must have something to look to, which must exist not potentially but actually. </p>                        </div>

The better therefore will be the prior, both as having a different nature from body, and as always actually existent: mind, therefore, and soul are prior to mere nature; soul, therefore, does not exist as breath, nor yet as body. However, though other arguments might be stated, and have been stated by others, showing that it is not body, yet even what I have now said is sufficient. <br />'But since it is of a different nature, we must inquire what this nature is. Is it then, though different from body, yet something belonging to body, as it were a harmony? For although the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> used this word harmony in a different way, they supposed that it was something of the same kind as the harmony on the strings of the lyre. <br />'For as when the strings of the lyre have been stretched tight there conies a certain kind of effect upon them, which is called harmony, in the same way also in our body, when a mixture is made of unlike elements, they thought that a mixture of a certain quality produces both life and soul, which is the effect upon the mixture. But many arguments have ere now been urged against this opinion to show that it is impossible. <br />'For it has been argued that the soul is the prior element, but the harmony subsequent: and that the former rules and presides over the body, and in many ways contends with it, but could not do so if it were a harmony: and that the one is an essence, but the harmony is not an essence: and that the mixture of the bodily elements, of which we consist, if it be in due proportion, would mean health: also that in each part differently compounded there would be a different soul, so that there would be many souls: and, as the chief argument, that prior to this present soul there must be another soul to produce this harmony, as in the case of musical instruments there is the musician, who puts the harmony into the strings, having in himself the reasoning faculty in accordance with which he will modulate it. <br />'For neither in that case will the strings of themselves, nor in this case the bodily particles be able to bring themselves into harmony. And speaking generally, these philosophers also make animated things out of inanimate, and things casually brought out of disorder into order, and instead of order from the soul they make the soul itself to have received its subsistence from the self-made order. But this cannot possibly take place either in the single parts or in the wholes. The soul, therefore, is not a harmony.' </p>                        </div>

As the corporeal atoms have an undesigned and fortuitous motion, and move continuously and very swiftly, many of them were collected together, and from this cause had great variety of shapes and sizes. <br />'And when these were all gathered in the same place, all the larger and heaviest settled down: but as many as were small, and round, and smooth, and easily moved, were thrust out in the collision of the bodies, and carried up on high. <br />'When, therefore, the propelling force ceased to carry them upward, and the propulsion no longer tended towards the height, while on the other hand they were prevented from sinking downward, they were compressed into the places which were able to admit them; and these were the places around them. <br />'So the multitude of the bodies were turned round towards these places, and becoming intermingled one with another in the turning they generated the heaven. But the atoms retaining the same natural tendency, and being of various kinds, as I have said, were thrust out towards the upper region, and produced the nature of the stars. <br />'But the multitude of the bodies which were exhaled kept striking upon the air and thrusting it away; and the air in its motion being turned into wind and encompassing the stars carried them round with it, and maintained the revolution which they now have on high. Afterwards out of the particles which settled down the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> was produced, and out of those which were carried upward the heaven, and fire, and air. <br />'And as there was still much matter included in the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>, which became condensed in consequence of the blows from the winds and the currents from the stars, all of its shape that was formed by minute particles was further compressed, and generated the watery element. <br />'And this having a fluid tendency was carried down into the hollow places which were able to receive and hold it; or the water settled down of itself and gradually hollowed out the places below it.' </p>                        </div>

Also of those who study anxiously the nature of the universe some think that being is only one, others that it is infinite in multitude: some too think that all things are in perpetual motion, and others that nothing can ever be moved: and some that all things are being generated and perishing, but others that nothing could ever be generated or perish. <br />'He also used to ask the following questions about them: whereas those who study human affairs think that whatever they have learned they will be able to practise both for themselves and for whomsoever they may wish, do those who search after things divine think in like manner that when they know by what forces of necessity phenomena are severally produced, they will be able whenever they please to make winds and rains and seasons, and whatever else of this kind they may need? Or, without even hoping for anything of this sort, are they satisfied merely to know how such phenomena are severally produced? <br />'Such, then, was the nature of his remarks about those who busied themselves with these matters: but he himself was always discoursing of human interests, inquiring what was, pious, what impious; what noble, what base; what just, what unjust; what sanity, what madness.' </p>                        </div>
