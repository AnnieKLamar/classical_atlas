                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0017.tlg010:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[hypothesis] A certain <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> was the father of four children, Cyronides, <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a>, the mother of the speaker of this oration, and another daughter. During his lifetime he gave Cyronides in adoption to be heir of the estate of his maternal grandfather <a href=/people/8497 target=_blank>Xenaenetus</a>, and left his other children as his own heirs. Subsequently <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a> died without issue, as also did one of the daughters, and the whole estate passed by law to the mother of the speaker. Such was the position of affairs; but, after the death of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>, <a href=/people/353 target=_blank>Aristomenes</a>, his brother and now the legal representative of his brother's children, gave his own daughter in marriage to Cyronides, the son of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>, who had been adopted out of the family, having promised to obtain for him the estate of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>. This he succeeded in doing; for, when a son was born to Cyronides, they first gave him his grandfather's name, calling him <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> (II), and then had him adopted into his grandfather's family, on the ground that the latter had given instructions to this effect, and <a href=/people/353 target=_blank>Aristomenes</a> handed over to him all his grandfather's estate. <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> (II), dying without issue, constituted his own brother <a href=/people/8497 target=_blank>Xenaenetus</a> (II) by will as his heir. This being so and <a href=/people/8497 target=_blank>Xenaenetus</a> being in possession of the property of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> the elder, the son of the latter's daughter claims the estate from him, asserting that he is himself by law the sole heir to the fortune of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> the elder. For, he declares, Cyronides passed out of the family by adoption, and his father, having a legitimate son, namely, <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a>, could not adopt a child; nor were <a href=/people/850 target=_blank>Demochares</a>, being under age, and the other sister who predeceased him in a position to adopt a son into their father's family. Therefore, he argues, since the adoption of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> the younger was not good in law, his will could not stand either; for how could he pass on to another property which he acquired without right? The will being thus annulled, the estate ought naturally to pass to the speaker as son of the legitimate daughter of <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a> the elder. Such is the subject; the discussion is concerned with validity, namely, that of a written document; for the questions are whether such a will ought to stand and which party has the better claim. <br />I could wish, gentlemen, that, as <a href=/people/8497 target=_blank>Xenaenetus</a> here finds it easy to lie with boldness, so I with like confidence could speak the truth to you in presenting my claim; for then, I think, it would immediately become clear to you whether we have unjustly come forward to claim the inheritance and whether our opponents have been for a long time in wrongful possession of this fortune. But, as it is, we are not on equal terms; for they are both able speakers and clever plotters, so that they have often pleaded before you on behalf of others, whereas I, so far from speaking on behalf of another, have never before pleaded on my own behalf in a private suit, and therefore deserve great indulgence at your hands.</p>                        </div>

This question is a perfectly legal one; for the law ordains that a man can dispose of what is his own to anyone he likes, but it has never given anyone power over the possessions of another.</p>                        </div>
