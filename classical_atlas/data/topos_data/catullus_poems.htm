No one asks or takes the trouble to know?’ <br />I will, tell me, don’t hesitate. <br />‘Well first, the virgin, they say, who was handed over to us, was false.

<br />He opened the closed field with a wide path, <br />and granted my self and my girl a house, <br />where we carried on our mutual affair, <br />to which my bright goddess repaired <br />with gentle steps, set her graceful sandals <br />on the worn threshold, rested her shining feet, <br />as once with blazing passion <a href=/people/2680 target=_blank>Laodamia</a> came <br />to the house,

<br />if he went as a soldier to the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. <br />For now <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>’s

<br />To which they say the men of Greece hurried <br />from every side, deserting their household shrines, <br />lest <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, delighted, carried off at leisure, <br />to a peaceful bed, the adulteress he’d abducted. <br />Through your misfortune, then, loveliest <a href=/people/2680 target=_blank>Laodamia</a><br />your husband was taken from you, dearer to you <br />than life and spirit: love’s passion, swallowing you <br />in a whirlpool, carried you into the steep abyss, <br />as they say the soil of Greek <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379223PPhe class=place long=22.307 lat=37.9117>Pheneus</a> near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379224LKyl class=place long=22.3969 lat=37.9397>Cyllene</a><br />dried up, when the thick swamp was drained, <br />that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, the divinely-fathered, once dared to lance, <br />in the hacked out marrow of the mountains, <br />when his sure arrows struck the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379225PSty class=demonym long=22.4618 lat=37.8606>Stymphalian</a> birds, <br />at a worse master’s command, so that the threshold <br />of the heavens might be frequented by more gods, <br />and <a href=/people/576 target=_blank>Hebe</a> might not long remain a virgin. <br />But your deep love, that taught an untamed girl <br />to bear the yoke, was deeper still than that abyss. <br />Since the grandchild nursed by an only daughter, <br />is not as dear to her father, child of his old age, <br />that, when the child’s name is barely entered <br />in the grandfather’s will, disposing of his riches, <br />removing the scornful family’s impious joy, <br />scatters the vultures from his white head: <br />no spouse was ever as pleasing to a white dove, <br />that they say often sinfully gives far more kisses <br />nipping with its beak, than any woman <br />who beyond measure longs for as much. <br />But you alone outdo their great passion, <br />you who are won for ever by a golden-haired man. <br />You to whom the light of my life conceded little <br />or nothing in worth, when she gave herself <br />into my lap, who often shone, with <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Cupid</a><br />running about her, bright in his saffron tunic. <br />Even if she’s still not content with <a href=/people/1881 target=_blank>Catullus</a> alone, <br />I’ll suffer the infrequent affairs of a shy mistress, <br />lest I’m too annoying in the manner of fools. <br />Often even <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, greatest of goddesses, <br />swallows her burning anger with her spouse’s sins, <br />knowing the many affairs of all-willing <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. <br />And men are not to be compared with the gods,.... <br />bear the thankless burden of a worried father. <br />Yet, led by no father’s hand, she comes to me, <br />to the house, fragrant with <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> perfumes, <br />brings me the marvellous gift in the secret night, <br />she herself, stolen away from her husband’s breast. <br />And that is enough, if that alone’s granted to me, <br />that she marks out that day with a brighter light. <br />This then Allius, for you, what I can, a gift <br />made of song, in return for your friendship, <br />lest this day and that, and others on others <br />touch your name with corrosions of rust. <br />And let the gods add more to this, those gifts <br /><a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a> once used to bring to the pious of old. <br />May you be happy, both you and your life, <br />both your house in which we joyed, and the lady, <br />and he who first gave you to me, <br />from which source all our good was born, and she, <br />before everything, dearer to me than him, light of my life, through whose being alive, living is sweet to me. </p>                        </div>
