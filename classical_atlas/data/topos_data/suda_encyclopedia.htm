He wrote the so-called Scythinian Oracles and Marriage of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407260WHeb class=place long=26.1825 lat=40.78557>Hebros</a> and Purifications and a Theogony in prose and Arrival of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> among the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a> in meter. He came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> to Greece. <br />The legendary arrow belongs to him, the one he flew on from Greece to <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperborean</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>. It was given to him by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>. <br /><a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> the Theologian mentioned this man in his Epitaphios for <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> the Great. <br />They say that once, when there was a plague throughout the entire inhabited world, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> told the Greeks and barbarians who had come to consult his oracle that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> people should make prayers on behalf of all of them. So, many peoples sent ambassadors to them, and <a href=/people/11001 target=_blank>Abaris</a>, they say, came as ambassador of the <a href=/people/801 target=_blank>Hyperboreans</a> in the third Olympiad. <br />[Note] that the Bulgarians thoroughly destroyed the <a href=/people/5492 target=_blank>Avars</a> by force. <br />[Note] that these <a href=/people/5492 target=_blank>Avars</a> drove out the Sabinorians, when they themselves had been expelled by peoples living near the shore of the Ocean, who left their own land when a mist formed in the flood of the Ocean and a crowd of griffins appeared; the story was that they would not stop until they had devoured the race of men. So the people driven away by these monsters invaded their neighbors. As the invaders were stronger, the others submitted and left, just as the Saragurians, when they were driven out, went to the Akatziri <a href=/people/12084 target=_blank>Huns</a>. <br />The declension is <a href=/people/11001 target=_blank>Abaris</a>, Abaridos [genitive singular], Abaridas [accusative plural], and with apocope <a href=/people/11001 target=_blank>Abaris</a> [nominative plural]. <br />See about these things under 'Bulgarians'.

Ἀγκῶνες καὶ αἱ τῶν ποταμῶν ἐξοχαὶ, αἱ παρὰ ταῖς ὄχθαις. οὐ δυνατὸν ἦν πρὸς ἀντίον τὸν ῥοῦν ἀναπλεῖν διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῶν προσπιπτόντων ἀγκώνων, οὓς ἔδει κάμπτειν παρέλκοντας τὰς ναῦς. καὶ Ἀγκῶνας, τὰς ἄκρας τῶν ὀρῶν. οἱ δὲ σπείρουσιν ἀγκῶνας, οἱ δ' ἀντηλίους ζητεῖτ' ἰόντες τ' ἀνδρὸς ἔξοδον κακήν. καὶ παροιμία: τῷ ἀγκῶνι ἀπομυσσόμενος. Βίων φησὶν ὁ φιλόσοφος: ἐμοῦ ὁ πατὴρ μὲν ἦν ἀπελεύθερος, τῷ ἀγκῶνι ἀπομυσσόμενος: διεδήλου δὲ τὸν ταριχέμπορον. ζήτει καὶ ἄλλην παροιμίαν, τὸ γλυκὺς ἀγκών.

His father was one of those in the army who were faring rather poorly and he sent that son [<a href=/people/4377 target=_blank>Aetios</a>] away for fosterage and died. So he having come to the extreme of difficulty took himself to goldsmithing and became the best. But when his nature yearned for better studies, he turned to logical theories. And he joined Paulinos right when that man had recently arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>. He still attended him [as a student] in the time of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, displaying a great force of impiety in his disputations with his opponents, and few men could withstand him. After Paulinos died, when Eulalius held the see as twenty-third [in succession] from the apostles, many of those who had been shamed by <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetios</a> thought it a terrible thing to have been defeated by a man who was a newcomer and a craftsman: they banded together and drove him out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. Being driven out he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372359UAna class=place long=35.903 lat=37.2507>Anazarbos</a>. And he, so full of every ability, brought forth fruits better than his given circumstances. He did not at all stop disputing them, although he was poorly dressed and lived as he happened to be able. <br />This man was a heresiarch, who was called an atheist in the time of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> the Great. He believed the same things as <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a> and applauded the same doctrine, but he was separated from the Arians. <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetios</a> was a heretical man earlier and he passionately hastened to advocate the dogma of <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>, for in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> when he had learned a little he joined again. And upon arrival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> (for he was from that place) he was made a deacon by <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>, who was bishop at the time. And he shouted at those who met him, reading from the Categories of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and setting right the contentious arguments. He also patched together letters to the emperor <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>. But even though he said the same things as the Arianists, he nevertheless, although agreeing with those people, was thought a heretic by his own familiars who were unable to understand the complexity of the arguments. And on account of this he was brought to trial by their church and he himself decided [it was best] not to have dealings with them. And now because of that there are men called Aetianists and Eunomians. For <a href=/people/2741 target=_blank>Eunomios</a> was his secretary and was taught by him and preferred the heretical doctrine to that of the masses.

Thus, when images of him appeared in all the churches, some people began to think that he, in a pursuit of empty glory, had ordered their dedication, and no small confirmation of this suspicion was supplied by the mosaic image fashioned in the church by the harbor. For although the entire work had been completed in the time of <a href=/people/5676 target=_blank>Gennadios</a>, in a conspicuous place in the temple they portrayed [<a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Akakios</a>] and after him the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> saying to <a href=/people/5676 target=_blank>Gennadios</a> 'destroy this temple', and over him 'after you I will raise him up.' As a result of such images, then, <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Akakios</a>, though he was generous and a capable leader, nevertheless seemed to all to be excessively ambitious. <br />See concerning this man under <a href=/people/5502 target=_blank>Basiliskos</a>.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg9010.tlg.001:al.1121'><b>&sect; al.1121</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ἀλέξανδρος: <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, Alexandros: The son of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> and <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a>, who was king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> from age 18 and died at 33 years of age. <br />This man was very beautiful in body and very devoted to hard work and very acute, very courageous in judgement and very ambitious and very adventurous and very concerned for the divine; also very restrained as regards the pleasures of the body, but very keen on what judgement commended; very clever at discerning what was necessary, even when it was yet unclear, very successful in inferring from observations what was likely to follow, and very skilled at marshalling and equipping an army. <br />And he was very suited for every good. In addition he was moderate and god-fearing. For once, after he had become so angry with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> that he enslaved its inhabitants and razed the city [itself] to its foundations, he did not make light of reverence to the gods concerning the capture of the city; no, he took especial care that there should not be an involuntary sin concerning the shrines and the [religious] precincts as a whole. <br />The grandiloquence of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> did not seem more like a kind of arrogance than confidence in danger. <br /><a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> fell in love with <a href=/people/1966 target=_blank>Roxane</a>, the daughter of Oxyartos the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=person long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a>, whom those serving with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> say was the most beautiful of the Asian women after the wife of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>. And [they say that] when he had seen her <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> fell in love with her; and [that] although he was in love with her he did want to violate her as if she were a war captive, but did not think her unworthy to take in marriage. And I myself rather approve this action of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and do not censure it. And then this wife of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>, who was called the most beautiful of the women in Asia, either he did make an amorous approach to her or he controlled himself, although he was young and at the very height of good fortune, when men do outrageous things. He respected her and spared her, showing much restraint, and at the same time ambition for good repute which was not misplaced. And there is a story going around, that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>' eunuch who guarded his wife ran back to him. And <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>, when he saw him, first asked whether his daughters were alive and his sons and his wife and his mother. He learned they were alive, and that they were called queens, and about the care being taken of them and how his wife was behaving sensibly. At these things <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> raised his hands to heaven and prayed thus: 'O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, king, to whom it was given to order the affairs of kings among men, guard my rule over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> as you see fit. But if I myself cannot be king of Asia any more, then give my rule to no one but <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'. Thus even enemies are not indifferent to virtuous deeds. Thus says <a href=/people/2592 target=_blank>Arrian</a>. <br /><a href=/people/601 target=_blank>Nearchos</a> says that [<a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>] was pained by some of his friends, who were carrying him while he was ill, for running a personal risk in advance of his army; for these things were not for a general, but for a soldier. And it seems to me that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was irritated with these words, because he knew they were true and that he had laid himself open to censure. And yet his eagerness in battle and love of glory made him like men overcome by any other form of pleasure, and he was not strong enough to keep away from dangers. <br /><a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> lived a marvelous life. His handling of conflicts lent a guaranteed trustworthiness to what he said. For you cannot find a man in this whole orb of the world having the advantage in such great achievements. For he spent time with the best men, and in written accounts is found not inferior to those who are praised to the skies; and in matters of war he accomplished things that were more marvelous than believable. And having gone to war against <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>, he prevailed victorious over him. And that man begged him to come to a reconciliation, and even gave him his daughter <a href=/people/1966 target=_blank>Roxane</a> in a covenant of marriage. Having subdued all races he lost his mind and succumbed to the pleasures of the body, putting on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> dress and being attended by myriad youths, and using 300 concubines, so that he changed the entire <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> royal way of life into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> ways and annulled those of his own people. Later, arriving in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, he was caught by queen Kandake in the clothes of a private individual and she said to him: '<a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, king: you took the world and you are overcome by a woman?' And he made peace with her and kept her country from harm. <br />The same encountered men who had been captured long ago by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> in Greece and had had their hands cut off, and he showed them kindness with great gifts and cheered them. Arriving at the lake in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> he threw away his diadem, and with so much water crashing down only scarcely swam safe across to land. And he was given poison by his own general Kas[s]andros and was convulsed; and thus, at [a time of] such great successes, ended his life. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

And again: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> sent to question the oracle, longing to get a cure for the curse, and it prophesied thus: 'I hold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=place long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delos</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375235SKal class=place long=23.4803 lat=37.5227>Calauria</a> the same and sacred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a> and wind-swept <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>.' <br />Since there are times when aneilen means murdered. But anelein is prophesying, either from taking up the spirit from above and being filled by the god, or from taking away ignorance. We also say the same anelein in application to murdering, either from taking away the spirit deep within a man, or from the opposite, from taking up an inquiry. Anelein is also used for the taking up and raising of exposed babies, and [it is] simply whatever someone might take up. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

But later he took to unaccustomed luxury and had a mistress, wild man that he was; and straightaway, little by little, everything was turned over to him. <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> says, <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> was young, but filled with warlike passion, successful in the fray, and motivated from the start by his hatred of the Romans. <br />It was made clear to <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, by [the oracle] of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a>, that he would die and be buried in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. And he hoped to stamp out the Roman empire and to end it in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. When <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a>, the general of the Romans, was eager to take him alive, he went as suppliant to <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> and when he was thrust away by <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a>, he leapt up onto his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and since his sword was unsheathed, he wounded his finger.

Which even now ?is a civilized way to behave?. <br />In contriving to make the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> see the magnitude of his victory over the Romans and the plight of their opponents, <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> sent into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> three Attic medimni full of golden rings, which he had stripped as spoils from men of equestrian and senatorial rank. <br />Certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> who were sent out by <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> to spy fell in with the Romans.

This man seemed at first to be an attempter of great things and daring and able to follow through on his what had been begun, but as he moved along in life he proved much inferior to himself and the general expectation. <br />For from the sons of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> came a sinful root, this <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a>, son of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleukos</a> <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a>. He was a terrible man and greedy and he committed many ravagings and lootings and acquired a lot of money and from intemperance and mad passion he fell to mimicking himself in the sight of everyone and doted madly after women. He seized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> with a heavy mob and chariots and elephants and a great army and took control of it. Turning back after losing all sense he took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and slaughtered 180000. So he dared to go even into the sanctuary and set up an altar and an abominable idol of desolation and defiled the temple with unclean sacrifices and called it the shrine to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=person long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a> <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. And thus enthroned on high and with his armed soldiers stationed around him in a circle he commanded the mercenaries to drag in each and every Hebrew and give him pork meat and force him to sacrifice to idols; unless they would eat the forbidden meat, they tortured and killed them. So many were seized, and a certain <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, [one] of the foremost scholars, already advanced in age, would not eat the abominable meat and was flogged and slain with his seven children and their mother Solomonis. (Concerning these matters the Theologian too makes mention in his What the <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabees</a> did.) The king, struck rather mad and driven out of his senses, took all the sacred vessels and plundered the whole city and butchered its flocks and made slaughter and he returned boasting to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. And after two years of fighting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he dispatched a commander to levy tribute from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. [The commander] neared the city and spoke words of peace to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and went in — and dealt the city a huge blow: he tore down the walls and set the whole city alight, and defiled the temple and killed many and went away with prisoners, having left a commander behind to torture the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. A certain <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a>, a priest, had five sons, of which <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabeus</a> was one; he was full of zeal and struck out against the commander and killed him and tore up the altars of the Greeks. So <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> came against him with great force. As the war went on, <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, a brother of <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a>, showed courage when he was crushed by the elephant. For he sneaked up on the elephant and struck it in the belly with his sword, hoping to take the king above him. So <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochos</a> marched out against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and turned out the loser and lost his life foully. <br />This same <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochos</a>, when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> people were in revolt against the regular tribute, again enslaved them: he pillaged the offerings of the temple and searching everything he found a statuette holding a book in its hands and a beard thrust deep; by which stood a gold-wrought lampstand. He smeared these things with <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>pig</a> blood and left them in the temple; and having imposed on the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> inhabitants a fine of many talents for extracting the tribute he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>.

They call the first [day] Dorpeia, when the members of phratries come together and are entertained in the evening; the second [they call] Anarrysis, on account of the sacrificing — they used to sacrifice to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Phratrios and to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>; and the third [they call] Koureotis, from the enrolment of youths (κούρους ) and maidens into the phratries. This is the reason: the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> had a war on against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boiotians</a> over Melainai, which was a place in their borderlands. <a href=/people/7037 target=_blank>Xanthios</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=person long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boiotian</a>, challenged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> king, Thymoites [to a fight]. When he did not accept, <a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthos</a>, an expatriate <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372218RMes class=demonym long=21.8 lat=37.2>Messenian</a> from the stock of <a href=/people/2022 target=_blank>Periklymenos</a> the son of <a href=/people/1278 target=_blank>Neleus</a>, stood up to fight for the kingdom. While they were engaged in single combat, someone wearing a black <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>-skin aegis appeared to <a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthos</a> from behind <a href=/people/7037 target=_blank>Xanthios</a>. So [<a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthos</a>] said that it was not right to come two against one. [<a href=/people/7037 target=_blank>Xanthios</a>] turned round. [<a href=/people/1083 target=_blank>Melanthos</a>] smote him and killed him. And from this was generated both the festival <a href=/people/4855 target=_blank>Apatouria</a> and of the Black Aegis as an epithet of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. But some say that because fathers go together alike through the enrolment of their sons, it is called the same father (ὁμοπατόρια ) festival; in the same way we say that a spouse [is] of the same bed and a bed-mate, so also [we say] the same father, Apatoria. And <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> [writes]: he wanted to eat sausages from the <a href=/people/4855 target=_blank>Apatouria</a>.

He was an acquaintance of them both, and of the sophist <a href=/people/3416 target=_blank>Libanius</a>, and of a number of others. He was not just a grammarian and a talented poet, but also (and far more) he was trained in philosophy; and he was a very able rhetor. He wrote in prose 30 volumes against the impious <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a>, and the whole of the Hebrew scriptures in epic verse. He wrote letters, and also many commentaries on the Scriptures. <a href=/people/3660 target=_blank>Philostorgius</a> mentions <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> in his history of his own times, and says: in those days <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> was flourishing in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355358PLao class=place long=35.7849 lat=35.52>Laodicea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387355UMaz class=place long=35.4881 lat=38.7207>Caesarea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> in <a href=/people/6690 target=_blank>Nazianzus</a> (this place is a way-station in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>). These three men were then champions of consubstantiality against difference of substance, completely overshadowing all those who previously, or subsequently up to my own time, had stood up for that heresy; <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> could be judged a child by comparison with them. For they were very advanced in the so-called 'external' education, and they had great proficiency in everything that contributes to the study and prompt recollection of Holy Scripture. This was especially true of <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a>, since he could understand Hebrew. Each of them was very well able to write in his own manner. <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> far excelled in the style that suits commentaries; <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> was most brilliant in panegryic; but <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, compared with the two of them, had the soundest basis for written composition. <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> was more powerful, <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> weightier, in speech. Such was their ability in speech and written composition; and in the same degree these men presented a character attractive to the public gaze. So all who saw them or heard them or received their writings were drawn into their communion, if they could easily be caught by any of their arguments.

The younger <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> regarded what had happened as an insult, and relying on his sophistic ingenuity he too invented his own heresy, which is still current, and bears the name of its inventor. Others say that they disagreed with <a href=/people/4538 target=_blank>George</a>, because they saw that his doctrine was unsound. <br />This <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> had the audacity to believe in degrees of the divine nature, and attached myths to God's promises.

He flourished during the rule of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, Gaius [<a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>], and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> until <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>'s reign, during which he did indeed pass away.

He set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, then went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> to meet the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a>, and then met the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>. He collected from all of them the numberless conjurations widely ascribed to him. So many works he composed: the Initiations or On Sacrifices, the Testament, the Oracles, the Epistles, the Life of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>. <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=person long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a> wrote a biography that pays respect to this man as a true philosopher. According to <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a>, <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> had more self-restraint than <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, who used to say that only after reaching old age did he escape a raging and savage beast of a master. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a>, on the contrary, with his virtue and temperance was not overcome by these urges, even in his youth. According to <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a>, he approached wisdom in a more godlike way than <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> because <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a> bested tyrannies, and his was an era not so long ago. Men do not yet grant him recognition for the truth of his philosophy, which he practised both wisely and soundly. But some praise one aspect of the man, others another. Yet others, given that he consulted with the magi of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, the <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahmins</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=person long=74 lat=30>India</a> and the naked ascetics of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, regard him as a magus and unfairly claim that he was not a true philosopher, misapprehending him. For <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> himself and <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> too, though they associated with magicians and spoke many marvellous and divine things, were never drawn to magic. Though <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and, just like a painter adding color to a sketch, blended in his dialogues many teachings of the prophets and priests of that country, he was never regarded as a magus and yet was the most envied of men for his wisdom. Nor should we slur <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a>' intuition and prescience in the things he predicted with this kind of wisdom any more than <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> might be accused for his predictions and so <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, who at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, when there was not the slightest sign of rain, went out into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216BOSt class=place long=21.63333 lat=37.63924>stadium</a> under a fleece, so suggesting that it would rain. Though many attribute such to <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, they turn right around to deny <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a> the prescience that was intrinsic to his wisdom. So I think one should not heed the nonsense of the many, but should investigate what <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonios</a> said and did according to the times and the special character of the skill through which he succeeded in being thought supernatural and divine. I have collected information from the cities devoted to him; other information comes from sanctuaries whose lapsed rites he restored, and from what others wrote to him and he to others. He corresponded with kings, sophists, philosophers, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleans</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> on gods, customs, and laws. We can know in more detail what he was doing among them through <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a>, his student and witness. <br />This <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> had an excellent memory, if anyone did. He truly kept his vow of silence but gathered much information, and when a hundred years old he had a sharper memory than <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>. He composed and used to sing a hymn to <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a>, in which he says that Time causes everything to waste away but Time itself through <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a> is both ageless and immortal. With regard to <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, look for other predictions of his under <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a>. <br />[<a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a> also reports] that this <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said the following about <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>: he was from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=place long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a> and he said his teachings were meant for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, and that he would rather philosophize with beasts than men .

The contentious questions which were daily agitated among them led them to assert some absurd propositions. For whereas it is believed in the Church that God is the Father of the Son, the Word, they asked whether God could be called 'Father' before the Son had subsistence. Thus in supposing that the Word of God was not begotten of the Father, but came into subsistence out of non-being, and thus slipping into error on the chief and main point, they predictably fell into absurd disputations about a mere name. <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, therefore, when they sent for him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, began to maintain that God could neither be nor be called Father before the Son existed. But <a href=/people/1842 target=_blank>Marinus</a>, whom they had summoned out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> before <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a> (annoyed because they preferred <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a> to him) undertook to defend the contrary opinion. There arose a schism among them respecting this term, and each party began to hold separate meetings. [The followers of <a href=/people/1842 target=_blank>Marinus</a>] asserted that the Father had always been Father, even when the Son had not come into subsistence. This section was denominated Psathyrians, because a certain Theoctistus, a Syrian by birth, and a cake-seller [psathyropoles] by trade, defended this opinion with great zeal. Selenas bishop of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> followed this party. This faction however soon quarreled among themselves, <a href=/people/1842 target=_blank>Marinus</a> disagreeing with Agapius, whom he himself had preferred to the bishopric of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. They disputed, however, not about any point of religion, but in narrow-mindedness about precedence, in which the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> sided with Agapius. [The Arians] continued to be divided among themselves for thirty-five years, until [the reign] of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> the Younger.

For instance, in a short time he came to a complete understanding of all the mixtures of dye colors and of the manifold dyes used in decorating clothing, and furthermore the many differences of woods, how their fibers are disposed concerning straightness and curvature. But still further, the various properties and types of stones and plants, those lying near to hand and those which were rarer, were investigated and discovered by every means. He proved a great nuisance to those who made their living in each of these areas when he would sit down beside them for a long time and question them about each thing in the most minute detail. He held the history of plants in rather high esteem and still more the [history] of animals, and he investigated the local ones by observation and inquired into those which were not possible [to see] by report, up to the ends of the earth, reading over as much as the ancients had recorded about them. He was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=demonym long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrian</a> by birth. Thus, I know by frequent experience that this man propounded well the goodly sect and did not fall far short of his father at all in his righteous zeal and in the sort of intense and passionate hope that leads to the divine; however, he was more philosophical than that man and was equipped with other preparatory education. Accordingly, the city of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> ascended in his time toward greater holiness. Already he had expelled abominable practices into the hinterlands, and into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, which worshipped <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and served as high priestess of the East. In addition to his loftiness he was easy-going and the company he provided to those whom he met was very pleasant. He was of a good disposition from childhood up until his old age, and he brought many innovations sprung from his own nature into the rites, for which he managed the adornment of the images and assigned hymns. Though he was a thrifty household manager and a farmer, when his father died he had to pay back many debts. Having established himself on a sound financial footing he nevertheless incurred great expenses, on account of his religious inclination and other political ambition which seemed to be necessary and customary for his family. As a result he himself was later compelled to leave an indebted estate to his daughters. Let these things be recorded by me rendering small favors in return for great. <br />Look in [the entry on] deisidaimonia [religious awe]. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

And when he reached manhood he was converted to the catholic church. He was sensible more by nature than by education and became acquainted with moral duties, sufficient to plan and to stand fast in his plans, attractive in his character so that he was agreeable to many, mediocre in his discourses for the church so that those who heard did not consider them necessary to write down, nor were they completely without their share of education. For being of good taste, if the opportunity arose, he practiced on the most esteemed historians among the Greeks. Because he seemed to be an ordinary person, when he held discourse about these things, he often was overlooked by those who were knowledgeable. He was said to have been zealous towards those who were likeminded, but fearsome to those who held other opinions. And easily whenever he wished he inspired fear in these men, and then changing again he appeared gentle. And so they say he was this sort of man. <br />This man <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> after being educated was pious and sensible, so it was agreed to bestow the churches upon him for the most part. For not only did he train the those of the household of faith, but he also beat down the heretics with his knowledge; and he did not prefer to maltreat them in any way, but frightened them and again became meek. But he was not neglectful of letters, for he labored over the lectures of the ancients and spent his nights studying them; wherefore he was not recognized by the sophistic philosophers. He was gracious and attractive to those he met and he grieved along with those who were distressed, and, after the example of the Apostle, he became all things to all men. And when he was an old man, he learned and labored at the words which he taught to the churches; but later on, along with his diligence being possessed also of a certain frankness, he taught even the most solemn things extempore, and saying farewell to the study of grammar he turned to the ascetic life. For these were not the sort of words as to be respected by the hearers or committed to writing. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

He was one of those attending the emperor <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> in a prominent capacity in the army, having become one of the clerks whom the Romans call notarii. The manner of his confession was as follows: In a certain courtyard in the royal dwelling there was a water fountain and on it a statue of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>; a magnificent vine grew all around it and made the whole place pleasantly shady and sheltered. Here <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> arrived on the pretext of resting, with Auxentius and many others from his retinue following. Looking up at the vine he saw a certain bunch of grapes, ripe and large, hanging from the branches. He ordered Auxentius to cut it. And he straightaway took off the dagger that was attached to his breeches and cut it, suspecting nothing. Then <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> said to him: Now put the bunch at the feet of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>. But he answered, No, my king, for I am <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a>. And <a href=/people/232 target=_blank>Licinius</a> said: Then resign from the army and remove yourself from my presence, for you must do one or the other of those two things. And he, without hesitation, undid his belt and gladly departed, just like that, from the palace. And after some time the authorities made him bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370356UMop class=place long=35.6237 lat=36.9576>Mopsuestia</a>.

For the former was best at providing foundations, but the latter was far more capable of perfecting and explaining in a clear and impressive manner those that had been provided.

But she, thinking there to be but one storehouse of hope for the better — for whoever might wish to lighten the burdens of holy and virtuous men — spared nothing, out of her pity for the fortunes that befall humankind. Therefore even the most wretched of the citizens loved her. She especially took care for her sons in the area of philosophy, desiring to bequeath to them the wisdom of their father as though it were a sort of inheritence of paternal property. She saved for the children the public allowance given to their father when they were still young, so they studied philosophy. This is something that we know of no other man doing, much less any other woman. There was no small amount of honor and respect for <a href=/people/4813 target=_blank>Aidesia</a> in the eyes of all. But when she even sailed together with her sons to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, who were sent there to learn philosophy, it was not only the common crowd of philosophers who marvelled at her virtue, but even their chief, <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a>. It is this <a href=/people/4813 target=_blank>Aidesia</a> whom <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianos</a> would have betrothed to <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a> had not one of the gods prevented <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a> from entering upon marriage. In regard to divine matters she was so pious and holy and, to put it in a single word, god-loving, that she was deemed worthy of many epiphanies. Such was <a href=/people/4813 target=_blank>Aidesia</a>, and she lived her whole life beloved and praised by god and by men. I met her when she was an old woman, and at her death, while I was still young, a mere lad in fact, I recited at her tomb the customary eulogy adorned with heroic verses. Of her sons by <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermeias</a>, <a href=/people/1203 target=_blank>Heliodoros</a> was the younger and <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonios</a> the older. The latter was more talented and more studious, the former simpler and more ordinary in his habits and in his speech. Both studied philosophy under <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a>, with their mother acting as pedagogue when they came to him. <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a> paid special attention to them as children of <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermeias</a>, a man who was his friend and companion, and as children of <a href=/people/4813 target=_blank>Aidesia</a>, who was related by birth to <a href=/people/1721 target=_blank>Syrianos</a> and was there together with them at that time. In fact <a href=/people/2052 target=_blank>Hierax</a> the brother of Synesios came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with them also.

When <a href=/people/11056 target=_blank>Numerianus</a> — or some say <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a> — was prompted by some demon to go into a crowded church, <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a> stood in front of the door and kept him from coming in, saying that as far as it was in his power he would not allow the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> to go in among the flock. <a href=/people/11056 target=_blank>Numerianus</a> at once backed off from the door, either sensing the sedition in the crowd or changing his mind for some other reason. But he was not happy about the bishop's opposition, so after he went back to his quarters at the palace he summoned him to his presence and brought an accusation against him for hindering him. He then ordered <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a> to sacrifice to the deities if he wanted to avoid a trial on this charge. The bishop spoke in his own defense against the charge and responded to the challenge, first of all, that for him as a shepherd it was entirely appropriate feel strongly about his flock. Moreover, he said that he would not turn away from the real God and sacrifice to destructive falsely-named deities. Then <a href=/people/11056 target=_blank>Numerianus</a>, seeing that <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a> was not persuaded, ordered that he be bound by chains and fetters and taken off to his death by beheading. As <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a> was being led off to die, he answered in the words of the Psalm: My soul, turn to your rest, for the Lord has made you prosper. They also say that there were three boys, brothers by birth, all very young, that had grown up in <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a>'s household. The Emperor seized them also and, because they refused to sacrifice even though induced to by all kinds of threats, the Emperor ordered that they should be beheaded. When they came to the appointed place, <a href=/people/4088 target=_blank>Babylas</a> stood before them and encouraged them not to tremble or to draw back from their deaths. And he proclaimed as they were being beheaded, Look, I and the children God has given to me. Then he offered his own neck to the sword, bidding those who collected the bodies to bury the chains and fetters with him, so that they may adorn me as I lie there, he said. And they say these [chains] are still with him. (Tr: ANNE MAHONEY) </p>                        </div>

For in those times <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> flourished in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocian</a> Caesarea and <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> in Nadiandus (this place was a station in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>) and <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355358PLao class=place long=35.7849 lat=35.52>Laodicea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. These three men then fiercely defended the consubstantiality against the heterosubstantiality, having surpassed by and large everybody who in the past and later, until my own day, supported this same heresy, so that <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> would be judged a child in comparison to them. They progressed far in the so-called education from outside; and of the holy scriptures, as much as they through the reading filled their memory, they had much experience and of them <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> had the most. And each one of them was in his own way a most respectable writer. <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> was by far at his best in the panegyrical genre: he was indeed most brilliant in delivering festival orations; <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> on the other hand was excellent in the commentary genre. <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, however, had — and this was also the judgment of the other two — the largest resources for the composing of homilies. These things <a href=/people/3660 target=_blank>Philostorgius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350255UAri class=person long=25.4503 lat=34.9926>Arian</a> as if in passing wrote about them. <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> died when <a href=/people/1998 target=_blank>Gratianus</a> held the scepter of the Romans. <br /><a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> the Great had four brothers: <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> the bishop of Nyssa, and Peter (also a bishop), and two others who became monks.

For they called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> προσέληνοι [before the moon] because they claimed to be the oldest [people] and to have arisen before the moon. So βεκεσέληνε [is] like προσέληνε . But also βεκεσέληνε by itself is derived from a story like this. When <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetikhos</a> became king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, he wanted to know which of all men were the eldest and arose first. But as even after much investigation he was not able to find out the accurate truth because many were contentious in this matter, he devised something like this. Taking two newborn infants he shut them up in a house absolutely isolated. And some say that he sent she-<a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> to them, which suckled and nourished the infants; others say that he assigned wet-nurses, cutting out their tongues so that the infants would not hear their voices. <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetikhos</a> did this because he wanted to know what sound the children would first utter, apart from meaningless whimpering. So as the third year passed of this form of nurture, he sent into the house one of his closest friends bidding him go by in silence. But when he opened the doors, stretching out their hands the children called out bekos. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> call bread by this name. And so <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetikhos</a> found and felt confident that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> had arisen first. But if the first story is true, that <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> nursed the children and not a woman, it is no wonder that hearing the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a> they imitated her voice, and it is a coincidence that such an expression occurs among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>. Thus then βεκεσέληνε indicates that which is old, the expression being compounded from βέκος, according the story which has been told, and from προσέληνε, because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> were called before the moon [προσέληνοι ].

Among them there are no domestic animals, no farming, no iron, no house construction, no fire, no gold, no silver, no bread, no wine, no eating of meat. Only the humid, sweet and well-tempered air which relieves them of every sickness and morbidity.

After spending 40 days with their wives they cross back over again. But when a women has given birth to two children, her husband no longer crosses over to her, nor indeed does she have relations with any other [man] on account of a great sense of propriety. If it should happen that one of the women is discovered to be barren, for a period of five years her husband will cross over and have intercourse with her. If she does not give birth he will no longer have relations with her. Because of this their land is not highly populated, because of their modest appetites. <br />And the plural is Βραχμᾶνες and [in the dative plural] Βραχμᾶσι .

They praise him and they wonder at his merit — not [only] the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, but even some of the Romans — since (they say) he was a lover of literature and came to mastery of our philosophy, when the Greek writings had been translated for him into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> language by someone.

But I, <a href=/people/2706 target=_blank>Agathias</a> says, would never have believed that he had such an excellent education and this consummate attainment. For how would it have been possible for that purity of ancient words, free and suited and completely fit to the nature of things to have been preserved in a unrefined and discordant language? How could a man who was exalted from childhood by royal pomp and a great deal of flattery, who had a very barbaric lifestyle, who was always on the lookout for wars and conspiracies, how could a man who was set on such a course of life [be supposed] to derive enjoyment from and be trained in these teachings? Therefore, if one should praise him, although he was a king and a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, concerned with so many peoples and matters, because he nevertheless desired to enjoy literature somehow or other and to be exalted in his reputation for these things, then even I myself would praise the man and consider him greater than the other barbarians. But as many as go too far in calling him 'wise' and all but superior to those who ever practiced philosophy anywhere, [saying] that he knew the principles and causes of every art and discipline ... those men would be caught straying far from the truth and following only the rumour of the masses.

He practised medicine in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aigina</a>, where he married, and he also acted as physician to <a href=/people/331 target=_blank>Polykrates</a>, the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, for two gold talents; and he was summoned by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> and stayed with him for a considerable time. He wrote a medical book. <br />When <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> the king was out hunting he twisted his foot while dismounting from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and did so rather violently; for the astragal came out from the joint. He first summoned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> doctors he had around him, considered to be the foremost, skilled in medical arts. They treated him, but, by twisting and stretching the foot they caused major damage. For seven days and seven nights <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> could not sleep because of the hurt he was experiencing; but on the eighth day of his affliction someone who had heard, before leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, of the skill of <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=person long=17.129 lat=39.081>Kroton</a> informed <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>, who ordered [<a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a>] to be brought to him as soon as possible. Finding <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a> utterly neglected somewhere among <a href=/people/5149 target=_blank>Oroetes</a>' slaves, they brought him forward, dragging his chains and dressed in rags. As he stood there on public view, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> asked him whether he knew the skill [of a doctor]. <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a> denied this, fearful that if he revealed himself he would not be able to return to Greece again. It was clear to <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> that he was trying to trick him by craftiness, and he ordered the men who fetched him to step forward with whips and goads. So then, of course, <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a> came clean, while maintaining that his learning was imprecise; he had, though, kept company with a physician and thereby picked up some insufficient knowledge of the art. But later <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> entrusted himself to <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a>, who with the use of Greek remedies and gentle rather than forcible means — after such procedures had been tried by others — succeeded in getting <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a> his sleep and, after a while, healed him completely, though he had lost hope of having the proper use of his foot again. So says <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> the historian. [He also says] that <a href=/people/1741 target=_blank>Atossa</a>, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Kyros</a>' daughter and the wife of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Dareios</a>, found an abscess growing in her breast which broke and spread further. As long as it was small, she hid it because of shame and did not tell anyone about it; but when it turned for the worse she sent for <a href=/people/1473 target=_blank>Demokedes</a> and showed it to him. He said that he could heal her but made her swear that she would do him any service he asked for in return, saying that he would not ask for anything that was shameful. And what he asked for was his return to Greece. (Tr: CARL WIDSTRAND) </p>                        </div>

In these [spoken words] at any rate he said many disjointed things, and particularly in his discourses on the Father and the Son. For he says: the Son is born by the will of the Father alone, timelessly, without intermediary, so that he might become the minister and servant of the Father's intentions. For since God who foreknew what he would do + was impossible of the uncontrolled order of God who was going to make them in their coming-to-be.+ For either they would all have had to become gods according to the rank of the one who made them, and therefore they would be gods, or else they would have had to be destroyed as they came into being, like wax brought near to a hot fire. So the Son became an intermediary between those who would come to be and the God who had begotten him, so that subjecting himself and condescending to those who were coming to be he might accomplish the intention of the Father. And he has become an intermediary between God and us who have come to be through him. In saying these things [<a href=/people/1939 target=_blank>Demophilos</a>] did not recognize that he was falsely attributing weakness and malice to the God of all and declaring the Son inferior to all the creation. For [the Father] was weak according to <a href=/people/1939 target=_blank>Demophilos</a>, if when he desired he was unable to give being to all things; and he would not be acquitted of malice, if although it was possible for him to make everything gods he was obviously devising a way to keep the things which would come to be from attaining this rank. And of the creatures there was not one who was not shown to be better than the Son, since he did not happen to have come into being through himself, but through the purpose and need of their coming-to-be. For it must be the case that whatever comes to be for the need of others is inferior to those for the benefit of which it obtains its being. And he spoke a lot more nonsense too.

Overwhelmed by the number of <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> seized, they made an ordinance that any <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> who were discovered should have their right eye gouged out, not only for the pain, but for the dishonor and the mark and the distinction from the Roman way of life.

But he was careful and quick when it came to applying what had to be done and he transformed many aspects of devotion to the emperor to something far more presumptuous than had been the ancestral custom for the Romans. <br />[It is said] that <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> and <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a> gave up their imperial positions and returned to private life. <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> went to an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=demonym long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrian</a> city named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435165USal class=place long=16.4834 lat=43.5397>Salonai</a>, whereas <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a> went to the territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Leucanians</a>.

After he put faith in Paul's preaching <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> was appointed by him as the bishop of the city. So during the reign of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a>, when he also was in the prime of his manhood, he left for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, because he longed to meet with the learned men of that country. Along with him also came the well-known <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> the Sophist, whose disciple at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> was <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=person long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, the master of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>. Around the time of the saving passion of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the Lord, the two of them were staying at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/301313UHel class=place long=31.3075 lat=30.1293>Helioupolis</a>, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Now, since the solar eclipse took place in an unnatural way — it was not the appointed time for conjunction — it is said that <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> the Sophist addressed the blessed <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> with these words: my good <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, [these are] the requitals for divine things!. It is <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> himself that mentions all of these events in the letter he wrote to <a href=/people/2918 target=_blank>Polycarp</a> the Great, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, as <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> was attacking <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> because of his adherence to the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> religion. And [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>] said: but you say that <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> the Sophist is railing at me, and calls me parricide on the grounds that I impiously use the [thought] of the Greeks against the Greeks. However, it would be more true for us to reply to him that the Greeks impiously use divine things against [other] divine things, because they attempt to overthrow the respect due to God through the wisdom, which comes from God. After a while, he said: but even <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> himself is impiously using divine things against [other] divine things. The true philosophers ought indeed to be led by the knowledge of reality, which he does well to call 'philosophy' and the divine Paul has called 'wisdom of God', toward the Cause of the reality itself and the knowledge of that [reality]. And after a while: since <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> is a wise man, he should be aware that of the order and the movements of Heaven, nothing could otherwise be altered, [than] if it were moved to that point by the one who holds it together and causes its existence, [the one] who creates and transforms everything, according to the Scriptures. And after a while again, tell then to him: what do you say about the solar eclipse that took place at the time of the saving Cross? Then indeed, when both of us were present at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/301313UHel class=place long=31.3075 lat=30.1293>Helioupolis</a> and were together, we saw the Moon falling upon the Sun, contrary to any expectation, for it was not the appointed time for conjunction. And again the Moon from the ninth hour up to the evening was set up against the solar disk in an unnatural way. And let him remember some further detail: he [sc. <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a>] knows that we saw the contact itself starting from east and moving up to the edge of the Sun, then stepping back with a retrograde motion; and again the contact and the end of the eclipse did not take place from the same direction, but from diametrically opposite points. So great were the prodigies of that time, possible only for <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, the cause of all, the One who makes great and extraordinary things, so numerous that it is impossible to count them.[14a] If you think you can do it righteously and are able to, <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> [said <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>], try to deny it in front of me, who was with you on that occasion, and who has seen, examined and wondered with you at these events. Actually, I don't know whence, <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> at that time started prophesying, and said to me as if he was interpreting the things which happened: 'My good <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, [these are] the requitals of divine things'. Such marvelous events the great <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> narrated in his letter to the inspired <a href=/people/2918 target=_blank>Polycarp</a>. A demonstration giving a precise idea of his wisdom and his eloquence is the style of the books he wrote, that could never be surpassed: his knowledge was great in both kinds of culture, the one so-called by the pagans, and ours, the divine one. Indeed, if one looks at the beauty of his words and the depth of his thoughts, one would think that they are the offspring not of a human nature, but of an incorruptible, divine power. <br />Now, the following are the books he wrote: to Timothy, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, who was himself a disciple of Paul, 12 books On Divine Names; [these include:] On Unity and Distinction of Divine Word; On the question What is the might of prayer and On the blessed Hierotheus, On <a href=/people/1591 target=_blank>Piety</a>, Theological summary; On Good; On Light; On <a href=/people/1588 target=_blank>Beauty</a>; On <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>; On Ecstasy; On Zeal; Evil is not a being, nor derives from existing things, nor is inside existing things; On Being, therein Examples; On Life; On <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>; On Mind; On Reason; On <a href=/people/819 target=_blank>Truth</a>; On Belief; On Power; On <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>; On Salvation; On Purification; On the great and the small; On Identity; On Alterity; On Similarity; On Difference; On Rest; On Movement; On equality; On the Sovereign of All, the Ancient of days, therein On Eternity and Time; On <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>; What means being itself; On the Holy of the Holies, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God of Gods. Another book, dedicated to the same Timothy, [is] On Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, including 15 chapters; another book, to the same Timothy, On Celestial Hierarchy, also in 15 chapters, another book to the same Timothy On Mystical Theology, including 5 chapters, On the heavenly orders and what their number is. <br />Letters of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> are transmitted to the monk Gaius in number of four; one to the deacon <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>; one to the priest Sopatros; one <a href=/people/2918 target=_blank>Polycarp</a>, hierarch of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>; one to the monk <a href=/people/1939 target=_blank>Demophilos</a>; one to John the Theologian, the apostle and evangelist. We should know that some of the pagan philosophers, and especially <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>, often have used the theories of the blessed <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and they did it also with his bare words. One might suppose from that, that the earlier <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> philosophers, after having usurped his works — as <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> himself mentions, writing to <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> — hid it, in order to be seen as the authors of his divine books. <br />Thus, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, the revealer of God, already aged and old, died as a martyr for <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> under the reign of Traian Caesar, when also the inspired <a href=/people/4567 target=_blank>Ignatius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> entered the combat for immortality. <br />A <a href=/people/1665 target=_blank>Praise</a> to the Great <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> has been written by Michael Syncellus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=person long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, in which he says: what we have received through his written or unwritten teaching, we come to explain it to you all, who are willing to listen. A narration has come down to us, transmitted from father to son, that the above mentioned great <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, at the time of the saving Passion, when at noon the Sun was obscured, astonished at the extraordinary phenomenon and going beyond the [limits of] human understanding, said 'An unknown God is suffering, for the sake of whom all things are being darkened and shaken'. And immediately, right at the moment this universal miracle was produced, he had conjectured [the reasons] and was observing by himself, waiting for the meaning that would be announced by that. He himself mentions that most frightening solar eclipse in the letter to the bishop <a href=/people/2918 target=_blank>Polycarp</a>. For <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a>, a philosopher, follower of the Greek religion, was railing and attacking this thrice-fortunate man, as, albeit he was his beloved companion, of his same origin, he felt disgusted for the religion of his country and chose the one of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, embraced a faith and fought for it most bravely, and used Greek writings against the Greeks. In the attempt of refuting that attack and anger, or rather of giving it as a suggestion to <a href=/people/2918 target=_blank>Polycarp</a>, since the mockery was also directed against him by the fellow, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> says the following words: but you say that <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a> the Sophist is railing at me, and calls me parricide etc. (Tr: ANTONELLA IPPOLITO) </p>                        </div>

He emulated not his father's or his brother's habit of good government, but, on the contrary, the appetite for iniquity of <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>. He canvassed every form of evil, and having had his fill of murder, woman-craziness and even man-craziness he, though godless, finally made himself into a god. Then that wretched man, having proved himself to be hateful to all, and despised on account of his murderous nature and the beastliness of his polluted mind, quite appropriately brought upon himself the rewards of his own malevolence, and brought an end to his depraved and obscene life with the most shameful of fates. <br />This man, under the influence of some demonic bewitchment, grew spiteful of his brother and did away with him by poison, out of his passion for power. And although the affairs of the Romans were in a wretched state, he did not curtail any of his forms or pursuits of savagery, greed, murderous activity or anything else, along with his lack of self control and discipline as regards matters of the body. He also exiled <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> on the charge that he was plotting to obtain the principate, and he arrested <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> as a friend of <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> and had him shorn and brought into court in fetters. And when the philosopher did not relent in his ridicule of the things that had happened on account of him and in his criticism of the things that had been done, out of shame he ordered him taken away. It was then, they say, that <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> uttered that famous remark — You will not kill me, since, I assure you, I am not mortal — and thereupon immediately disappeared. <br />This man banished even the philosophers and the mathematicians from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. In his reign also John the Evangelist was exiled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373265IPat class=place long=26.5352 lat=37.326>Patmos</a>. And he ordered those from the family of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> to be executed, and many <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> were martyred under him. <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> released John the Theologian from exile. <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, who was a restorer in many respects, also installed a king over the Lazoi or Kolchoi.

They arranged to send in <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanos</a> the freedman with a dagger; and he fell upon <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> while he was sleeping in the middle of the day and struck him, not, in fact, at the right time, but when he had already leapt up from bed.

The remedy was to stuff oneself with pork. Now <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> did not submit to this cure, even though it was not a traditional religious offence for him, but arose from sleep, propped himself up on the couch on his elbow, looked towards the cult statue of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asklepios</a> (since he happened to be sleeping in the anteroom of the shrine) and said, What, my lord, have you commanded for the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> who is sick with this illness? Since surely you would not have ordered that man to fill himself with pork. So he spoke, and <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asklepios</a> from the statue immediately prescribed another treatment for his illness: a very fitting utterance indeed. But <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninos</a>, contrary to the traditional law of Syrians, persuaded by the dream and failing to follow the example of <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a>, then and ever afterwards consumed pork. It is said that if he somehow went one day without tasting it he was afflicted with the full force of his illness until he gorged himself. <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asklepiodotos</a> as a youth is said to have encountered <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> when he had grown old, and to have seen a man somewhat excessive and stiff, who did not deign to speak at length with those he met, whether private individuals or foreigners: not even with those who could claim some distinction. <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asklepiodotos</a> was unconcerned that he would also be treated rather harshly, since he did not think he ought to agree with <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninus</a> about some numerical theorem or other because he was a young man, nor to submit meekly, but rather to debate the argument so forcefully that <a href=/people/2869 target=_blank>Domninos</a> no longer admitted him into his company.

As for <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>, although still young, he was not able to easily descend from his bed by himself, but he was short-sighted and fearful of facing the sunlight, for he disliked the most brilliant and shiny of the gods. And indeed he turned his eyes away even from the light of fire, and from his lower orifices blood used to drip down, and such was the consumption of his body that he was not even able to carry the weight of his own clothes. And <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> and <a href=/people/1676 target=_blank>Polyaenus</a>, both of them his companions, died in the worst way men can die, and indeed they took for their impiety a requital that nobody might ever blame. So easily overcome by pleasure was <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> that in his last moments he wrote in his will a disposition that a sacrifice be offered once a year to his father, his mother and his brothers, and to the previously mentioned <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> and <a href=/people/1676 target=_blank>Polyaenus</a>, but twice a year to himself, for clever as he was, even in that which he honored was the higher degree of profligacy.

Disabled in a leg because of a flux, he lived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390207PNic class=place long=20.7322 lat=39.0181>Nicopolis</a>, [a city] of [the province of] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> Nova; and his life extended until the reign of <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus Antoninus</a>. He wrote many books. <br />[sc. <a href=/people/3012 target=_blank>Damascius</a> says that] the philosopher <a href=/people/8402 target=_blank>Theosebius</a> drew much of his speeches' matter from <a href=/people/1264 target=_blank>Epictetus</a>' Disputations, but others of these he elaborated on his own, as inventions of a <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> adept in reproducing characters and sufficient to convince and abash those souls which are not completely hard-hearted and tough: [e.g. the necessity of] keeping away and eschewing the worst aspects of life as much as possible, and, on the other side, of cherishing and pursuing the best ones, as it is possible with all one's might. Thus, he left his admonitions also in treatises of the same kind — in some way — of those by which <a href=/people/1264 target=_blank>Epictetus</a> had previously taught his doctrine. And on the other side, it seems to me that if we directly compare [these two philosophers] to each other, this man [<a href=/people/8402 target=_blank>Theosebius</a>] turns out to be the <a href=/people/1264 target=_blank>Epictetus</a> of our age, yet without the [whole] <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> doctrine: for there was nothing that <a href=/people/8402 target=_blank>Theosebius</a> followed and admired as much as the truth of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>. He wrote indeed a small opuscule concerning The Ingenious Ideas in the great 'Republic', praising the divine wisdom coming down from the Gods, which he especially honored and worshipped: for it was evident that he always dealt rather with moral speculations. He grew indeed more interested in [the topic of] good life than in scientific knowledge, meaning by good life not a quiet one, nor a life only trained in speculative activities, but one involved enough in practical problems, if certainly he lived his life not according to the public way, but according to his own private way, the same pursued by the great <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, by <a href=/people/1264 target=_blank>Epictetus</a> and by every wise man, administering his own set of rules, the one he had inside — and that was the first issue — then [a set of rules] also connecting others, each one privately for his part, for the best end.

Sophist. The philosopher <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> attended his classes. He lived under the emperor Marcus [sc. <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a>], and had great natural talent. When he was lacking in years his wisdom by contrast abounded; but he did not enjoy this for long, since at the age of about 24 he went out of his mind and did not know himself, although there was no cause and no physical ailment. Consequently some made the following joke about this poor, poor person: '<a href=/people/970 target=_blank>Hermogenes</a>, an old man among boys and a boy among old men.' But aged about 18 or 20 he wrote these books, laden with marvels: Art of Rhetoric, which is in everyone's hands; On Issues (1 book); On Types of Styles (2 books); On <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a> (2 books). <br /><a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=person long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, in his Descriptions of the Sophists, has this to say about him: <a href=/people/970 target=_blank>Hermogenes</a>, whom <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> bore, when he was 15 years old had advanced to such great fame as a sophist as to make even the emperor Marcus desire to hear him. So Marcus went to hear him; he was delighted by his informal discourse and amazed by his improvisation, and gave him splendid gifts. But when he reached adulthood he was deprived of his ability, though not by any apparent disease. Hence he gave the envious an opportunity for humour: they said that words are winged, just as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says; for <a href=/people/970 target=_blank>Hermogenes</a> had moulted them like feathers. And the sophist <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> once mocked him by saying: 'This is <a href=/people/970 target=_blank>Hermogenes</a>, an old man among boys and a boy among old men.' The type of style which he cultivated was like this. In his informal discourse before Marcus he said: 'See, emperor, a rhetor still needing a pedagogue, a rhetor still awaiting his prime.' And the informal discourse contained many similar pieces of buffoonery. He died at an advanced age, but considered as one of the crowd; he was despised, because his art had left him. <br />This is also said about him by some people: after his death he was cut open, and his heart was found to be covered in hair and far to exceed in size the human nature. These are the stories that are told about him. (Tr: MALCOLM HEATH) </p>                        </div>

So too, he studied with <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a>.

According to some, he wrote 75 plays; others say 92, but 77 survive. He won five victories: four during his lifetime, one postumously when his nephew <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> produced the plays. <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> himself produced plays for twenty-two years straight, his last during the 93rd Olympiad.

A boy with both parents living carries out this and places it before the door of the sanctuary of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> during the Pyanopsia [festival].

For this reason the festival seems to be called the Pyanopsia, as if to say Kyamepsia. For in the past they used to call kyamoi ['beans'] pyanoi.

Meaning it will burn [it]. An eiresione [is] a branch of olive or laurel woven around from woollen fillets, with bread hung from it and a kotyle, which is a half-pint cup, and figs and all good things. This they set in front of their houses and would replace it annually. Otherwise [sc. defined as follows]. An eiresione [is] a branch of olive with woollen fillets woven in; it was hung with produce of all kinds; they set it in front of their doors in accordance with an ancient oracle. For they say that when plague gripped all the land, the god called for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to celebrate the sacrifice of the Proerosia to <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a> on behalf of everyone; for this reason they send to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> from everywhere the first-fruits of the produce.

For as soon as he looked at one his heart was struck by a sensation of the divine and he gave a start in his body and his soul, as though seized by the god. If he was not moved in such a fashion then the statue was soulless and had no share of divine inspiration. In this way he distinguished the secret statue of <a href=/people/7194 target=_blank>Aion</a> which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> worshipped as being possessed by the god, who was both <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a> at the same time according to some mystical union. There was also something in <a href=/people/3607 target=_blank>Heraiskos</a>' nature that rejected defilements of nature. For instance, if he heard any unclean woman speaking, no matter where or how, he immediately got a headache, and this was taken as a sign that she was menstruating. Thus while he lived there was always something godlike about him; and at his death, when <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asklepiades</a> was preparing to give the customary things to the priests, especially the garment of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> on his body, at once secret symbols shone with light on all parts of the fabric, and around them were seen kinds of appearances appropriate to a god, showing clearly with what great gods he had been a dinner-guest. Even his birth had something mystical about it: he is said to have issued from his mother holding the shushing finger up to his lips, just as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> tell the story about <a href=/people/2135 target=_blank>Oros</a> and before <a href=/people/2135 target=_blank>Oros</a> about <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>. As a result, since the finger was fused to his lips, he needed surgery, and he went through life with a scar on his lip, a clear sign for everyone to see of his marvelous birth. <br />Hence his life also reached such a point that his soul always resided in hidden sanctuaries as he practiced not only his native rites in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> but also those of other nations, wherever there was something left of these. <br />And <a href=/people/3607 target=_blank>Heraiskos</a> became a Bakkhos, as a dream designated him. <br />But <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asklepiades</a> devoting himself more to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> books was more precisely acquainted with their native theology, having investigated its origins and middle, and simply busying himself with the ignorance of the furthest limits, as it is possible to know clearly from the hymns which he composed to the gods of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and from the treatise which he undertook to write encompassing the harmony of all theologies. And he wrote a book encompassing lore of the primeval <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> not less than thirty thousand years but even a little more. <br /><a href=/people/3607 target=_blank>Heraiskos</a> was not only good and gentle, but he was inclined to anger at wickedness and manfully resisted the schemes of men, yet never transgressing the measure of justice. For <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonios</a> and Erythrios the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> contended with each other in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and each always continued to thrust the other into the most extreme dangers. <br />See [sc. further] concerning <a href=/people/3607 target=_blank>Heraiskos</a> under Gesios.

He returned and, after bringing his own teacher Domnus the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> and his colleagues into his practice he became known to nearly everyone everywhere and acquired a great reputation, not only for his medical competence and his teaching skill and industriousness, but also for his all-around refinement in other areas. For since he was an honorable and diligent man he achieved in addition, in the course of time, a considerable reputation for wisdom by means of study and not by natural talent. And he established a technique of medical practices and doctrines that was more accurate than all the physicians and medical theorists of his time. He was slow at the beginning to demonstrate his knowledge in public, but he quickly progressed and thrived in it, since he was stately and eloquent; delving only a little in philosophy, but in medicine to the fullest. In this way he came to possess a large fortune and was granted imperial honors that were far from ordinary. But I am convinced of the courageous integrity of his soul; for when <a href=/people/3607 target=_blank>Heraiskos</a> was being persecuted by the emperor <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> he hid him in his own house, disregarding the danger, and even, when he got sick in his flight and left his body, he laid him out well and performed the customary services.

This man was not only well-versed in the arts of grammar and poetry but excelled even more in philosophy, and was an accomplished rhetor. This man wrote many prose works; for his compositions count together approximately 30000 lines. Amongst them are the following: On the death of his brother <a href=/people/7416 target=_blank>Caesarius</a>, Funeral Oration for his father, another one for his sister Gorgonia, On loving the poor, Praises of the <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabaeans</a>, Praises of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a>, Praises of <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, Praises of the philosopher Heron, two orations Against the Emperor <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, two orations Against <a href=/people/2741 target=_blank>Eunomius</a>, one oration On theology, two orations On the Son, one oration On the Holy Spirit, ten Festival orations; also many others that are known to everybody. In this he followed the example of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=person long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, who lectured in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> and became the teacher of <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> the rhetor. He wrote another book in hexameters, discussing in this mode virginity and marriage as well as several other subjects in all sorts of different metres, all together approximately 30000 lines. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350255UAri class=person long=25.4503 lat=34.9926>Arian</a> <a href=/people/3660 target=_blank>Philostorgius</a>, too, mentions this <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> in his history of his own times, and says: For in those days <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> was flourishing in <a href=/people/6690 target=_blank>Nazianzus</a> (this place is a way-station in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>) and <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387355UMaz class=place long=35.4881 lat=38.7207>Caesarea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> and <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355358PLao class=place long=35.7849 lat=35.52>Laodicea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. These three men, of course, were then fierce defenders of consubstantiality against difference of substance, completely overshadowing all those who previously, or subsequently up to my own time, had stood up for that heresy; <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> could be judged a child by comparison with them. For they were very advanced in the so-called 'external' education, and they had great proficiency in everything that contributes to the study and prompt recollection of Holy Scripture, and <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> most of all of them. Each of them was very well able to write in his own manner. At any rate <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> far excelled in the style that suits commentaries; <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> was most brilliant in panegryic; but <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, compared with the two of them, had the soundest basis for written composition. <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinarius</a> was more powerful, <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a> weightier, in speech. Such was their ability in speech and written composition; and in the same degree these men presented a character attractive to the public gaze. So all who saw them or heard them or received their writings were drawn into their communion, if they could easily be caught by any of their arguments. That is what <a href=/people/3660 target=_blank>Philostorgius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350255UAri class=person long=25.4503 lat=34.9926>Arian</a> wrote about them in passing. After having been for some time in his home-town, <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> appointed a bishop in the church community which he was assigned to but chose for himself a solitary life in a barren desert. Having run ninety years and more, he left this life in the thirteenth year of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, suffering from the fact that it had been unworthy to his talents: he was knocked off the (episcopal) seat of the imperial city and preference was given to persons more common than this man who on the basis of his talent and splendour of his life surpassed them all.

After studying with him for five years they were sent back to their homeland; for which reason while <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> was away from home he wrote a panegyric of thanksgiving to <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, and summoning all his countrymen, in the presence of <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> himself, he recited this speech, which is extant up to the present time. He also wrote a Paraphrase of <a href=/people/6446 target=_blank>Ecclesiastes</a>, a very short but very marvelous work. And he composed many other letters and discourses of various kinds, as well as performing signs and miracles beyond human power, when he became bishop.

The results of this were not as he had wished; instead he suffered a major defeat; yet he did accomplish other things while he was in power, most notably the following. He waged war on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>, inheriting the war from his father. For he attacked and laid siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> in this way: when the fruit was ripe in the land, then he invaded with his army. He marched out with pipes and harps and auloi both treble and baritone. And as he came into the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=ethnic long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Milesians</a>, he neither tore down nor set fire to the homesteads in the country, nor even tore off the doors, but permitted them to stand in the country; but he did destroy both the trees and the crops in the land, and then went back.

He derived his lineage from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>. Reaching the greatest precision in science he was accomplished not only in diagnosing diseases but also in curing them, [working] carefully and competently, [having learned] both from reading and from experience. Thus he attained the first place in medical reputation among the physicians of his time, and was even compared with the ancients, and surpassed many of them. As if having a godlike power he was loved and venerated by those who besought him. He was so confident in himself and in judgment by his own methods that if, going to a sick person and diagnosing by the symptoms, he declared that the patient was likely to live, everyone became hopeful that health would ensue; but if not, that death [would follow]. And no one ever was deceived in his expectation. He himself said that the best physician should either despair of the disease or by touching at once change the patient for the better, and leave him in a tolerable condition. Otherwise he should not depart before [sc. this happened]. He relieved nearly everyone from their troublesome afflictions immediately or a little later. For this reason the others used to call <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> savior, as formerly they also [called] <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asklepios</a>. But the physicians always used to slander and revile him, as not being any kind of physician but a holy man beloved of the gods; and they were not mistaken. For the man was gentle and truly favored by the god. If it is right to use the expression of the philosopher, he thought that <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>'s soul was Asclepiadian, and his nature <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407195PApo class=demonym long=19.4727 lat=40.7215>Apollonian</a>. In addition he took loving care of his pursuit, which particularly tends to associate all practitioners and attach them to the overseers of the art. Thus <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Pheidias</a> too [was said] to do his work under divine inspiration, thus also <a href=/people/10969 target=_blank>Zeuxis</a> portrayed his statues.

This man, along with his unchanging and magnificent breadth in thought to an outstanding degree and excelling in eloquence and abundance of the most beautiful nouns and verbs, used to astound his audiences everywhere.

The same Theosebios used to relate that <a href=/people/1945 target=_blank>Hierokles</a> once said that <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>' words were like cubes: they were everywhere 'no-fall', no matter how they landed.

For when he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> he gave offense to those in power and being led to trial he was beaten with the blows of men. As his blood flowed, dipping the hollow of his hand he sprinkled the judge, saying, <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, come, drink wine, since you eat the flesh of men. But when he was condemned to exile and returned much later to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> he taught his customary philosophy to those who approached.

Some of the historians who wrote about his overthrow have described exhaustively the terrible things that occurred in connection with his overthrow, saying, for instance, that no tyrant, not <a href=/people/654 target=_blank>Phalaris</a>, not <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>, not any other, was more harsh than he. He acquired power while still a child, then, after living no more than three or twelve months, departed this life. It is possible that at that time one or two people were tortured and even some of his friends and other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=ethnic long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusans</a> killed, but it is not likely that there was a overarching excess of lawlessness or surpassing impiety. And it must be said that in his behavior he became especially erratic and abnormal, but not so as to make it worthwhile to compare him with any of the aforementioned tyrants. But it seems to me that those who write history in small bits, or when they take on strictly limited and narrow subjects, are compelled by the poverty of their material to make small things large and to compose a lot of verbiage about things that are unworthy of mention. Some even fall into traps very similar to these through sheer lack of discernment. How much more judicious it would be to divert someone who was filling out his scrolls and planning out the course of his narrative on these matters toward <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hieron</a> and <a href=/people/1134 target=_blank>Gelon</a>, and to leave <a href=/people/478 target=_blank>Hieronymos</a> out of it. For this is more pleasant for serious listeners and more useful in every respect for serious students. (Tr: WILLIAM HUTTON) </p>                        </div>

He was affable by nature and in addition acute in speech and well-furnished with all kinds of books; nevertheless he had been a late learner in philosophical discourse. For as he had been required to devote his life to the public affairs of his fatherland, he had no leisure for philosophy. And in his youth he had a character resistant to self-control; so this also gave him much disinclination to the better life. But chance and opportunity came [to make him] wiser in this respect, when his dissolute youth had passed. For a certain misfortune occurred in the household, which turned out to be good fortune in a truer sense. For his wife had been caught having been corrupted by one of his friends. The seducer had become a rhetor by profession; <a href=/people/1450 target=_blank>Moschus</a> was his name. Having obtained some goodwill and affability from <a href=/people/2414 target=_blank>Hilarius</a>, he was revealed as unjust to his benefactor, for he was caught in adultery with his wife. But [<a href=/people/2414 target=_blank>Hilarius</a>], not at all disturbed by the event, did a deed demonstrating manliness and good sense. For when he caught the man, he yielded his wife to him and resigned his own rank on condition that that man serve on the Council according to the law. But he himself, for he had lived a childless life with his wife, leaving his fatherland transferred his life to the philosophers, moving to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>. When he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he wanted to become a disciple of <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> and attend his philosophical lectures. But as <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> did not tolerate his wantonness, having heard that he had come with his concubines and the life-style to which he was still accustomed, <a href=/people/2414 target=_blank>Hilarius</a> departed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and followed a different form of advantage more moderate than [the way] taught by <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>.

And he wrote to St. <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a> to signify to him the accuracy of his blameless faith and sent a letter full of orthodoxy. This man ruled after <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>: when this <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> gave his soldiers the choice to sacrifice or be discharged, <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a> preferred to remove his military belt. And, going to the well-populated city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a> and spending only two days here, he spent as much money as he had-sharing nothing with the inhabitants not a generous word nor a kind deed. He was a man, who had advanced to such a point of power not through his own virtue but through his father's reputation-for he was neither altogether physically weak nor unexercised in the tasks of warfare. But, being a man who lacked training and who had not been educated, he also dimmed and disfigured what natural ability he had through his laziness. <br />This man, ruling the Roman empire after <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a>, as I said, disdained all and was eager to reap the benefit of the honor that had come to him, and, fleeing from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, he hurried to come among the Roman peoples to display his luck and to turn over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a>, a city long subject to the Romans, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. Therefore, they mocked him in song and in burlesques and the so-called 'lampoons' because he had betrayed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a>, influenced by his wife, burned down a very nice temple established by the emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> for the deification of his father <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, and this temple had been made into a library by <a href=/people/158 target=_blank>Julian</a> for a eunuch named <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, but <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a> burnt it down along with all its books, and the concubines themselves set the fire as a joke. But the Antiochians got upset with the emperor and threw out some of the scrolls onto the ground so that whoever wanted could pick one out and read it, but they attached other scrolls to the walls. And such were these things. <br />You came from war; I wish you had died there. And You damned <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>, so very good-looking.... etc. And If I don't grab you and take off your fine clothes, your chlaina and chiton, which cover your modesty, you will swiftly send yourself against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> to your grief. <br />And an old woman who had seen that he was big and handsome and recognized that he was an idiot said: how great in length and depth is his foolery! And another private citizen dared to shout in a loud voice at the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> track and to mock him in front of everyone saying that his generation enjoyed cold beggary. And monstrous things would have happened, if a certain <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> had not ended the rebellion. <br />And <a href=/people/2887 target=_blank>Jovian</a>, when it was winter, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=place long=33 lat=40.1>Galatia</a> and died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402311UDad class=place long=31.1095 lat=40.1959>Dadastana</a> after eating a poisoned mushroom.

A presbyter among the most prominent at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, a follower of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> the philosopher of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a> and of Diodore. He is said to have written many things, among which his discourse On the Priesthood is outstanding in sublimity and expression and smoothness, and in the beauty of the words. This is rivaled by the homilies on the Psalms of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> and the interpretation of the Gospel according to John and the commentaries on <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a> and Mark and <a href=/people/6626 target=_blank>Luke</a>. The rest of his writings are beyond counting; for he commented on all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> and <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> Scriptures as no one else [has done]. He increased the festivals of the martyrs by improvising without hindrance, [so that] his tongue flowed more than the cataracts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. So no one has ever supplied such a flow of speech, in which he alone was wealthy, and he alone acquired the unadulterated name of golden and divine from everyone. But to reckon the number of his compositions is not [the work] of a man, but rather of God who knows all. <br />This holy <a href=/people/10862 target=_blank>John Chrysostom</a> was an extreme ascetic, sleeping little and very fond of solitude, speaking frankly out of zeal for self-control and easily angered; for he used to indulge wrath rather than shame, and employed free-speaking immoderately towards those who met him. And in teaching he was extremely helpful, but in chance meetings he was considered boastful and contemptuous by those who did not know him. For this reason when elevated to the episcopate he used a greater superciliousness against his disciples with a view to the correction and salvation of each one, and changing [their] behavior and speech. If one is not a flatterer, he should not therefore be considered a braggart; nor either, if one is a flatterer and low-born, should he be called humble-minded. But [this term should be applied] to him who maintains himself in the appropriate status, as befits free men; for one should be magnanimous, not arrogant, courageous, not rash, gentle, not slavish. So he himself says; for this reason the shepherd and teacher should be versatile. I say 'versatile', not unsound, nor a flatter nor insolent, but full of much liberality and frankness, knowing both how to come to agreement appropriately, when the basis of the facts requires this, and to be pleasant and austere at the same time. For it is not right to treat all one's followers in the same manner, since it is not good either for the servants of the physicians to prescribe only one medicine for all the sick, nor for the steersman to know only one road for the battle with the winds. Think what kind of man one must be who is going to stand up against such a storm and such a surge and such great waves in order to 'become all things to all men', so that he may benefit all. For such a man must be venerable and modest and awe-inspiring and kindly and authoritative and companionable and incorruptible and obsequious and humble and unslavish and cheerful and mild, so that he may easily combat these things. Therefore the productive and prudent man must avoid both flattering and accepting flattery; he must be neither boastful nor a flatterer, but chastise the excess of both these evils, and be a free man who does not either turn aside to willfulness or descend to slavishness. He should be humble with the good, but haughty with the rash. Since [the former] consider reasonableness to be virtue, but [the latter consider] rashness to be courage, [one should] present humble-mindedness to the former and to the latter the courage which quenches their self-importance which comes from rashness. There is a time for every matter, says <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>; that is for humility, authority, testing, encouragement, sparing, frankness, friendliness, severity, and in short for every matter; so that [it is right] at one time to demonstrate humility and to imitate the children in humbleness, according to the Lord's saying, and at another time to use authority, which the Lord gave for building up and not for destruction, when the situation calls for frankness. And in the time for encouragement [one ought] to show friendliness, but in the time for severity to reveal one's zeal, and at each of the other [times] similarly to bring the appropriate and just consideration. For consideration is the judgment of the just. And <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> [writes]: the ruler must be just and awe-inspiring, so that those who live a good life may take courage, but the sinners may hesitate. For one without the other is anarchy rather than rule. For if all were easily-persuaded and lovers of virtue, only goodness would be needed; but if they are lovers of sin, fear [is needed]. But since there are both good and bad [people], the ruler and leader must employ both. (Tr: CATHARINE ROTH) </p>                        </div>

This man was the first to trample down the Devil; this man took trophies of victory from the evil one, not by competing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=demonym long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemean</a> [Games] and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympian</a> [Games] and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=demonym long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmian</a> [Games] and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> [Games] and or as many [games] as the Greek stories brag about, but competing so as to defend his children and property and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and servants and all the things having to do with life, the strong-souled man having looked upon the tombs of the corpses of his family, the same ones having become man-filled with his own children, whom the all-abominable one in one day and hour spread out in heaps as they were being fed well and dining together at the table, when [the all-abominable one] had smitten their house, not two or three or four but ten, with all the men and women falling. And even with these things the rage and malice of the adversary was not kept off, until, having called out the naked athlete himself, he speckled him wholly with wounds and wore out the man full of worms, making him a sight horrible and strange to everything under the sun, gnashing his teeth and tongue for seven years, the whole body of the blessed man being crushed up until the all-abominable one drew defeat against himself and inherited a shameful end. You know the rest of the story and the prizes of this lover of wisdom. And you also have this man's book, singing much more sweetly than the books of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> the nightingale; not just narrating tales and sketches of foreign sufferings — either <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> the Bold or the ever-crafty <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, whose wounds became trophies and whose seductions of women became successes — but narrating <a href=/people/5238 target=_blank>Satan</a> smitten by some naked man, unarmed and alone, and the sympathizing of his friends with rhetoric and tears and natural histories of the whole of creation and the natures of living things, and birds, and other glorious narration. And narrating <a href=/people/5238 target=_blank>Satan</a> himself in the likeness of a dragon — twisted and having many curls, and eyes bright as from fire, and also the shared descent into <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> and the subterranean places of the dead, and again the redeeming of his righteous crown and children and entire property, taking many times more, and doubling his life-span. And with the names of his daughters being extraordinary — not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> or <a href=/people/434 target=_blank>Europa</a> or <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>, whom <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> highest of the gods deflowered, but taking surnames of Hemeras, Kasia, and <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amalthea</a> and being deemed more distinguished than all the women under the heavens. And, the greatest thing [that the daughters got was] the good lineage of Job, the prize-winner and crown-wearer, just as if [the daughters had] obtained by chance a token or a randomly selected lot. For this man alone, well-born of the people from the East, the illustrious and thrice-longed-for, this man earned, out of his own prizes, the best and most extreme: being resurrected together with <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and beholding again this world through his body, not like the fable of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> and <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alkestis</a> (wife of <a href=/people/996 target=_blank>Admetus</a>) whom, when she had died for her husband, the valiant fighter and man begotten over three nights raised up but then [he, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a>] perished accidentally in the end by fire and by a woman. But, by means of the unspeakable story of the power of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, this man disarmed <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> and carried off the dead from the subterranean parts, who took his seat at the right side of the Father with what he had taken previously. And he rules over all the invisible and visible creation. (Tr: CHRISTOPHER BABCOCK) </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/5656 target=_blank>Eurydike</a> formed an alliance with a general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> who was operating in the vicinity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and expelled <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>. Up to that point, then, rule passed to the eldest, and nothing unusual happened. <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> came to power at the age of twenty-two and conquered many peoples, both barbarians and Greeks, and he took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238PAmp class=place long=23.847 lat=40.822>Amphipolis</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> subject to his authority along with the thirty-two cities of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405233RCha class=demonym long=23.3 lat=40.5>Chalcidian</a> league, of which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403234POly class=ethnic long=23.354 lat=40.2963>Olynthians</a> were the leaders.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> granted citizenship to those who were rescued.

Later, while offering peace he demanded [Aster] and once he got hold of him, he hanged him. He also captured <a href=/people/704 target=_blank>Kersobleptes</a>, a Thracian king and an ally of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and he captured [the island of] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395250IHal class=place long=25.004 lat=39.513>Halonesus</a>, and other cities; and after this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> war arose.

Declaring a thirst for philosophy and associating with her [i.e. Philosophy] for a short time (for he was hateful to the gods) this <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Klearchos</a> saw in a dream a certain woman saying to him Begone from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> and flee philosophy; it is not right for you to enjoy her benefits, for she looks on you as the most hateful [of men].

Not long after, however, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a> fell into serious factional conflict.

Then having attained power [with the assistance] of the common people he was both the cruelest [of tyrants] and being totally inflamed with irresistible arrogance he was disdainful [of the fact] that he was still a man. He demanded that he receive obeisance and be honoured with the honours due to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=demonym long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympian</a> gods and he clothed himself in garments customary to the gods and [had himself represented] with statues fitting for them.

This was [done] in the symposia. And when all were playing, [one] stood up holding a bowl filled with unmixed wine and standing at a distance sent all the wine in one drop into the disk, so that being filled it would be weighed down and would fall down, and when it fell would strike against the head of the statuette which was hidden under the water and would make a noise. And if it was not poured out of the wine, he won and he knew that he was loved by his beloved [girl]; but if not, he was defeated. The statuette under the water was called manes.

The heretical <a href=/people/3660 target=_blank>Philostorgius</a> associates this <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a> with himself in his book as following the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350255UAri class=demonym long=25.4503 lat=34.9926>Arian</a> heresy. [<a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>] had one son. When he saw that the child was not giving indications of good hope for virtue, by prayer (so they say) he caused him to die while still a boy, as he judged that it was best to end his life before anything shameful [happened], taking him out of the perils and risks of life. They used to call him a measuring-rod of the Church. He was equally independent towards all in his thinking and spoke freely [to all]. Once when a council was held, and <a href=/people/1591 target=_blank>Eusebia</a> the wife of <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> was puffed up by a swelling of self-esteem and treated with reverence by the bishops, he alone stayed at home treating her with indifference. But she feeling overheated in her passions and inflamed in her sentiment, sent to him, begging and flattering him with promises, [saying] I will build a very great church for you and will spend a lot of money on it, if you come to me. But he replied, If you wish to accomplish any of this, o empress, know that you will not benefit me more than your own soul. But if you wish me to come to you, so that the respect due to bishops may be preserved, let me come to you, but do you descend at once from your lofty throne and meet me and offer your head to my hands, asking for my blessing. And then let me sit down, but do you stand respectfully, and sit only when I bid you, when I give the signal. If you accept this, I would come to you; but in any other way, you cannot give so much nor be capable of such great deeds that we, neglecting the honor due to the bishops, would do violence to the divine order of priesthood. When this message was reported to her, she swelled up in her soul, not considering it endurable to accept such words from <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>. Swelling with great anger and filled with emotion and making many threats from a woman's passionate and shallow disposition and describing [the situation] to her husband, she urged him to vengeance. But he instead praised the independence of [<a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>'] judgment and rebuked his wife for her anger and sent her away to the women's quarters. And then as the emperor <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a> sat in the midst of the bishops and wished to rule even over the churches, most [of the bishops] applauded and marveled as whatever he said, declaring that it was very well stated; but [<a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>] kept silent. And when the emperor asked him, Of all [these men], why do you alone keep silent? he said I am amazed that when ordered to manage other things, you put your hand to other things, being in charge of military and political matters, but you give orders to the bishops concerning those matters which belong only to bishops. And the emperor was ashamed and ceased from commanding them in such matters. So independent was <a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>. (Tr: CATHARINE ROTH) </p>                        </div>

For in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when Quintus <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> was consul a chasm developed in the midst of the forum, as the earth split open. The Romans knew from a <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> oracle that the earth would seal itself back together if the most valuable thing among humankind was pitched into the chasm, so some of them brought gold, and others silver, others their crops, and others whatever the most valuable thing was, and they supposed they understood the oracle. But as the chasm remained no smaller, <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a>, a man both finest to be seen and noblest of soul, said he understood the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline</a> oracle better than the others: for the most highly valued thing in the city was a man's excellence, and the words disclosed by the oracle really asked for this. So saying, he donned his armor and mounted his war <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. As everyone gawked at what he was doing, he drove headlong into the chasm. After the earth sealed itself back together, the Romans vowed to offer this man heroic rites annually in the midst of the forum, and they named the spot Libernus, and erected an altar there; from this <a href=/people/118 target=_blank>Vergil</a> too made his beginning.

When he offered his daughters instead, because of his hospitality to strangers, since [the men of Sodom] were not dissuaded, their sight was destroyed by the angels, but Lot together with his daughters and with his wife was sent out.

They say he got his laws either from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> or from the god. The <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> also addressed him as a god. This man also legislated for physical training for virgins; and that men should not have continual intercourse with their wives; and that newborn children be nursed upon a shield and washed in the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224WEur class=place long=22.427 lat=37.093>Eurotas</a>; and also the <a href=/people/7732 target=_blank>Gymnopaideia</a>, by which he compelled the young men, wearing no jackets, forever to devote themselves to physical training and to compete in public contests of excellence, and to sleep in the open air, and to have the sustenance that comes from hunting; and the practice of thorough beating as an exercise for excellence instead of sullen envy; for previously a young man used to be sacrificed to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224SArt class=place long=22.435 lat=37.083>Orthosia</a>. And also the 'philitia', which are like symposia and contain pains mixed with pleasures; for no cushion lay under those who feasted, but under their elbows the stone or wood. And he also legislated that they should be arrayed in battle to [the sound of] pipes, making the dishonoured life worse than death and proving it to be so, but that there was a release for that man if afterwards he should show excellence. This happened to <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemos</a>, who, being surnamed the Trembler from his desertion at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Pylai</a>, cancelled out his dishonour by his excellent performance at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataiai</a>. Because of this man's laws, mothers when sending forth their male children to the wars used to say, with reference to their shields, 'Either it, or on it', which stands for 'Either bring this when you return, and don't be a shield-thrower, or be brought upon this as a corpse'. This man appointed the other labours for the helots, but the practice of war for the well-born. And he expelled foreigners, suspecting the ruin that comes from intermingling. And he valued brevity of words, and poverty, believing the former to be a mark of wisdom, the latter a teacher of excellence. And [the?] god agrees with these: for often he ordained that one should guard against avarice. And establishing aristocracy and two kings from among the descendants of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a>, he laid down that the elders should be ephors; he made the people subordinate to them, selecting the best from each constitution. And he bound the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> by oath not to abolish the law, and went on his travels. And after he had secured an oracle from the god that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> would prosper to the degree that they did not transgress the laws of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lykourgos</a>, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> and starved himself to death so that he himself might not be compelled to abolish them. <br />The following was the end of life that came to <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lykourgos</a> the lawgiver. Wishing, so they say, to ask the god about certain remaining laws, he bound the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> by oath that until he returned no one would abolish the law as it stood. And after they swore, because when securing an oracle from the god he heard that the city would be blessed if it persisted with that man's laws, he determined never to come back, making certainty of the protection offered by the oath. And going down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> he made away with himself. And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a>, realizing because of his former excellence and that which he was now adjudged to have had regarding his death, consecrated a temple to him and, founding an altar, they sacrifice to him as a hero once every year. For he was conspicuously the cause of the complete excellence and leadership of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, who in older times had were in no better condition than the rest; not only because he set up laws of the best sort, but also because, when they were unwilling, he induced them to use his laws by the following means. Taking two <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a> from the same mother he started to bring them up, but separately from one another and with dissimilar behaviour: one at home, giving it cooked foods and other indulgence, [but] compelling the other to take part in hunts with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and tracking [with it] in the mountains. And as each of them became similar to its upbringing, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> were holding assembly with the perioikoi regarding war and were in a quandary, he brought along both <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> into the midst of them, and along with them roe-deers and soups and cooked foods, and said, '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, that nothing else is the cause of success and failure but the use of customs that are mean or wise, it is now possible for you to see. And these here' — pointing to the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> — 'being of the same mother but reared in the opposite way to one another, by this very reason have turned out dissimilar. For the one that learned to hunt, and the other that learned to indulge itself, would each do nothing contrary to its [habit] if opportunity arose.' And at the same moment he ordered the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-handler to let both of them loose upon the prepared items. One of them, the home-bred <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, leapt upon the cooked food, but the hunter leapt upon the deer, brought it down, and tore it apart. And <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lykourgos</a> once more said, '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, you must recognize that these things apply to you and to all other mortals. For whichever practices and laws you use, you are compelled to turn out that way with regard to pains and luxury; for all things that mortals may learn, the gods have given them. And the endurance of pain leads to the will to be free, to succeed, and to be master of all; but the enjoyment of pleasure leads to slavery, ill fortune, and worthlessness.' So with these words he induced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> to change their established way of life and to be habituated to better laws. And obeying him they became, in relation not only to the perioikoi but to all Hellenes, transparently the best men and the perpetual leaders, from the moment they accepted the laws up to the five hundredth year; and in not much time they proceeded to great power.

Some very excellent books were written by him: among these one is entitled The Monk or On Active <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>; another The Gnostic or On those who are deemed worthy of knowledge (it has 50 chapters); the Antirrhetic against the demons of temptation [is] divided into 8 parts, in accordance with the number of the 8 arguments; and 600 Prognostic Problems; and two Stichera [in verse], one addressed to the monks in monastic communities or synods and one addressed to the virgin. And he says this, word for word: It is necessary to inquire the way correctly from those monks who have traveled the road before and to correct oneself according to their ways, for there are many things said and done well by them. Among them also someone said this, that the drier and [not] irregular diet, assumed with love, leads a monk more quickly to passionlessness. (Tr: CATHARINE ROTH) </p>                        </div>

With 12 disciples, as if <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, he borrowed from every heresy any evil thing he could, and introduced into the Roman territory from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> a private contract against God. This man, called both <a href=/people/12062 target=_blank>Manes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a>, was <a href=/people/6301 target=_blank>Brahman</a> by race. He had as his teacher a Buddha, the one previously called <a href=/people/8382 target=_blank>Terebinthos</a>, who had been educated in the things of the Greeks and loved the school of <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a>, who had declared that there are two first principles opposed to each other. This <a href=/people/8382 target=_blank>Terebinthos</a>, when he arrived, said that he had been born in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> of a virgin and had been reared on the mountains. He also wrote four books, one The Book of Mysteries, another The Gospel, another The Treasure, another The Book of the Recapitulation. And this Buddha, the one also called <a href=/people/8382 target=_blank>Terebinthos</a>, being crushed by an unclean spirit, died. A woman with whom he lodged, inheriting his money and impure books, bought a little boy of seven years, <a href=/people/9213 target=_blank>Cubricus</a> by name, whom she taught writing and set free, making him her sole heir. Taking the books and money of Buddha he travelled through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, calling himself <a href=/people/12062 target=_blank>Manes</a>. Becoming expert in the wanderings of Buddha, he said that the books were his own labours. The Emperor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> flayed him alive as responsible for the death of his son. For, when the son was ill and receiving much treatment from the physicians, <a href=/people/9213 target=_blank>Cubricus</a> promised to heal him without the physicians; but in dismissing the physicians he caused his death. So this <a href=/people/12062 target=_blank>Manes</a> rejected the Old Testament and said blasphemously that the whole of creation and the condition of the human race belonged to a certain evil god, subject to mortality and change, but accepted the New Testament as indeed from a good God, and used to talk in portents, that <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> had appeared in his visions and imagination, also teaching certain accursed descents and nighttime and lawless sexual intercourse and filthy lewdness and destiny and transmigration of the soul and certain other Greek things. About him <a href=/people/2793 target=_blank>Theodore</a> the elder of Raithou said, Manes, who fantasized and dreamed that the Lord had appeared in some mere figment of the imagination and insubstantial shape of a human body, so that, on the one hand, he seemed to suffer and perform those things that [the Lord] suffered and performed among us, but, in truth and actuality, none of them happened, and with appearance and deceit he misled the people with whom he was thought to associate. Because of this he also refused to speak of two natures for <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, but of one only, that of the divine nature. But Paul, a contemporary, Bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=person long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> the Great, declared that the Lord was a mere man, as one of the prophets. <br />Paul, from whom also the Paulicians.

Thus he offered himself to everyone as a kind and just man, so that no one of the citizens ever brought a charge against him, nor any foreigner among his neighbors in the city or those in the nearby fields. In fact he did not consider it a work of justice if he did not do injustice to any member of the community, but rather only if he did not keep striving to do them good. Therefore he did not concern himself only with his own affairs but also with those of others, especially of neighboring residents in the city and the countryside. Especial evidence of this [is provided by the fact that] if anyone of his neighbors wanted to sell or buy something, the seller increased the price and the buyer increased the valuation above the market price, obviously just for this reason, to obtain as an abutter and neighbor Maras, the most just of all men.

Approaching the emperor he upbraided him insolently, calling him impious, apostate, atheist. The emperor countered this insolence with words [only], calling him a blind man; and he said, Not even your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328356WGal class=person long=35.6 lat=32.81>Galilean</a> god will heal you.

As if combating the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> by this very desire, he turned to another policy. He renounced the excessive cruelty of <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a>; nevertheless he did not refrain entirely from persecution. I call it persecution to harass in any way those who are living peacefully. He harassed them in this manner: by a law he ordered that the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> should not participate in any way in education, lest, he said, by sharpening their tongues they should be better prepared to debate with the pagan dialecticians. By employing many strategems against many individuals, he persuaded certain people to give in and sacrifice.

This man, after going out on a hunt and returning to the palace, when the men invited to dinner did not stand in the proper way, he threatened to inflict on them the death of <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>. Having learned about this from one who heard it, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> after the father's death proclaimed the younger [sc. son] king; <a href=/people/7776 target=_blank>Hormisdas</a> they locked up in a prison and iron fetters. But his wife let him out after introducing a metal file hidden in a fish, and then he ran off to <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> as a suppliant. The story [is] clear.

But I made little use of my professional qualification: for I had no wish either to plead court-cases or to inhabit the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BRoS class=place long=23.722336 lat=37.976123>Royal Stoa</a> and impress the passers-by with how cleverly I could speak. Consequently I abandoned my studies and chose a path of ease and idleness. What appealed to me was the rowdiness of the colours and the excitement of the horse-races, and especially pantomimic dancing. I even tried my hand at wrestling, and my voyage took me to such heights of folly that I not only lost my cloak but was also stripped, along with it, of common sense and everything else that makes life honourable. When Maurice assumed the imperial power, he was extremely caring toward his subjects and, besides, a lover of culture, especially poetry and history; so he spent most of the night on such pursuits and, consequently, offered monetary incentives to stimulate the sluggish in intellect. At that time I myself was disillusioned and frustrated at having no means, and I was thinking that I ought to stop drifting stupidly around; so, in order not to fritter away my life entirely, I made a start on this history, beginning after the death of <a href=/people/2706 target=_blank>Agathias</a> and making my starting-point [the end] of his history.

This man was open in his strong desire to become rich; he also wanted a command, to bring him more money; and he wanted honours, for extra profits. And his wish was to be a friend to the most powerful, so as to avoid paying the penalty for wrongdoing. As the shortest route to the attainment of his desires he saw perjury and lying and deceit; simplicity and truth, on the other hand, was something he considered foolish. It was obvious that he felt no affection for anyone; rather, whenever he claimed to be a friend to somebody, this person was plainly the target of his intrigues. He never laughed at an enemy, but always conversed with his own associates as if laughing at them. He did not scheme against the property of his enemies, for in his opinion it was difficult to take what belonged to men who were on their guard; instead, he was unique in realising that the property of his friends, unguarded, was easy to take. Any men he perceived as perjurors and wrongdoers he feared as well-protected, whereas the scrupulous and truthful he sought to treat as spineless. Just as some take pride in piety and truth and uprightness, so <a href=/people/813 target=_blank>Menon</a> took pride in his capacity to deceive, to fabricate falsehoods, and to sneer at friends; anyone not a villain he regarded as needing an education. When there was a group in which he wanted to be top man, he thought that the way to win over the first (dependants?) was by slandering love. His plan for making troops obedient was to become a partner in their crimes. He considered himself worthy of honours and attention by displaying that he had great powers and was willing to abuse them; but whenever someone parted company with him he used to say that he had done the man a kindness — he had employed him and not killed him.

And <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> had many spies. Some say that because he once gave a judgment against <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> was changed into an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>; or because he wronged the companions of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> in anger forced him to have <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s ears. Or because he had big ears. So the proverb is used of those who in no way pass unnoticed. <br />It is declined <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>, Midou. <br />Epitaph: here, waiting here on this much-lamented tomb, I will announce to passers-by that <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a> is buried here.

At first [<a href=/people/1235 target=_blank>Tros</a>] sent one of his attendants into the place where the boys were hunting, around the Granikos river; but <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a>, having sent out his ships a little beforehand to the river, came later to the sons and saw <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a> and fell in love with him. And having given out orders to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> and snatched the boy, he put him into the ship and sailed away. The place was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403274UHar class=place long=27.392 lat=40.3343>Harpagia</a>. <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> took the boy and went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>. The boy to ease his pain killed himself with a sword, and <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> buried him in the temple. Hence, of course, it is said that <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a> serves with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

So having been separated for this reason and having been appointed to the bishopric by the bishops who agreed with him, he wrote to the churches everywhere that they should not accept those who had sacrificed into their sacraments, but they should urge them towards repentance but leave their forgiveness to God, who was able and had the authority to forgive sins. [Those] throughout the provinces who received such letters made their decisions on the things set forth in accordance with their personal leanings. For as he indicated that it was not right to regard those who had committed mortal sin after baptism as worthy of the sacraments, to some his exposition of the canon seemed to be stringent and harsh, but others accepted it as just and ensuring properly governed life. With this [issue] stirred up to such an extent, letters followed from <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> the bishop which announced forgiveness for those who had sinned after baptism. So with both of them sending contradictory [orders] and each corroborating what he said from the scriptures, each man reverted to his own personal leaning and to that which he had previously been inclined.

He became a disciple of the philosopher <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonius</a>, surnamed Saccas, who possessed the loftiest competence in philosophy. Consequently, his knowledge of philosophic thought was bolstered greatly by his teacher, for <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> was constantly immersed in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and in the works of <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a> and <a href=/people/3283 target=_blank>Cronius</a>, <a href=/people/978 target=_blank>Apollophanes</a>, <a href=/people/1477 target=_blank>Longinus</a>, <a href=/people/9825 target=_blank>Moderatus</a>, and <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nicomachus</a>. He also devoted himself to the writings of the luminaries among the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a>. So too, he read the books of <a href=/people/2096 target=_blank>Chaeremon</a> and the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> thinker <a href=/people/1444 target=_blank>Cornutus</a>, from whom he learned allegorical technique integral to interpreting the Greek mysteries. He had an altogether remarkable knowledge of philosophical doctrines, not only secular but sacred: especially ours; that is, <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> doctrine. <br />What indeed can be said about the blessed nature of that near-immortal? For this man had such command of dialectics, geometry, mathematics, grammar, and rhetoric, as well as the doctrines of all philosophical systems that he attracted thoroughly devoted disciples, explaining to them — system by system — the many intricacies and interrelationships pertaining to each. Even <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a>, the raving anti-Christian, mentions <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> and his genius: But this kind of absurdity is attributable to a man whom I, in fact, met when I was still quite young. He was very famous and is still so because of the works he left behind. I refer to <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, whose renown is trumpeted loudly among teachers in these disciplines. And this testimony about the man is the same from foreigners and, notably, from detractors. These things were said by <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a> in the third book of his writings against the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. Although truthful about the man's training, a blatant lie about the rest (for what wouldn't an anti-Christian maniac be capable of?) where he says that <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> defected from the Greeks and <a href=/people/753 target=_blank>Ammonius</a> veered from a God-fearing life to that of a heathen. But enough of such talk; rather, on to illuminating <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>'s superb command of Greek learning. As to this acumen, he writes the following in a certain letter defending himself against those who faulted him for his zeal in these matters: As I was devoted to the word of God, and because the fame of our expertise was spreading widely, sometimes heretics and sometimes those skilled in Greek thought, especially philosophy, would come to me. It seemed appropriate to examine the doctrines of the heretics and the claims made by these philosophers to speak the truth. Just so did he write in defense of his training. <br />During this period, even <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a>, the mother of the Roman emperor <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, met and conversed with <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, and was instructed by him in the Word. The start of his Commentaries on divine Scripture dates to that time, after <a href=/people/8785 target=_blank>Ambrose</a> in particular urged him to undertake this enterprise not only through endless prodding and appeals to the man but with the provision of unlimited resources. Thus, more than seven stenographers were on call to take his dictation, shift-changing with one another at designated intervals; and no fewer were the number of copyists, along with young women skilled in penning a final text. <a href=/people/8785 target=_blank>Ambrose</a> supplied abundant resources to meet all their needs. Far beyond that, he imbued <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> with exceeding enthusiasm through his own study of God's pronouncements, and a zeal which gave <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> special inspiration in preparing his Commentaries. Moreover, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> directed such diligence toward divine Scripture that he made a thorough study of Hebrew — contrary to the proclivity of his times. <br />So too, along side the translations rendered by the Seventy, he arrayed other versions to fashion a single work. I am referring to the versions of <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and <a href=/people/6988 target=_blank>Theodotion</a> and <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a>, a member of the Ebionites (a sect whose heresy is in believing <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> a mere man). These Ebionites prepared a recension of the Gospel of <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a>, through which they rabidly assert their ideology. In like manner, he arrayed the fifth, sixth, and seventh versions. From the history of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> Pamphili concerning <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>. <br /><a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> subjected the divine words to such meticulous scrutiny that he personally gathered only original manuscripts in the actual Hebrew; tracked down versions by other translators besides the Seventy; and apart from the war-horse translations of <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a> and <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a> and <a href=/people/6988 target=_blank>Theodotion</a>, discovered certain others — from what nooks I do not know — but which, although having disappeared long ago, he managed to track down and uncover. Moreover, in the Hexapla text of Psalms, he inserted, after these four well-known versions, not only a fifth but also a sixth and a seventh translation. Regarding one of which he remarks that it was found at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a> in a large storage jar. Gathering them into a single work, he subsected them into clauses, comparing and contrasting one with another, and with the Hebrew text itself. He has left us copies of the Hexapla (as it is called), and prepared separately a version that contains <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a> and <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a> and <a href=/people/6988 target=_blank>Theodotion</a> together with the Seventy in the Tetrapla. <br />Having commented on every aspect of canonical Scripture, he left behind such a vast and pervasive body of work that from it would be derived thereafter the foundation for all teachings of the Church. So much so that the theologian <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, pronounced: <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> is the whetstone of us all. He provided a great service not only to our Church but to those outside it, heretics as well as philosophers, taught by him virtually the entire panoply of learning — secular philosophy in addition to things sacred. For he would introduce to the study of philosophy all whom he saw to be adept, imbuing them with geometry and arithmetic, and the other basic subjects. Then he would usher them on to philosophical systems, presenting these doctrines in detail, each element so adroitly that by this time he was heralded as an eminent philosopher, even among the Greeks themselves. <br />Witness to his prowess in these endeavors are the Greek philosophers themselves who flourished in his day, in whose treatises we find frequent mention of the man — sometimes dedicating the work to him, sometimes submitting their own work to his judgment, as to a master. <br />While <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> was in the course of his usual tasks at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, not only did many locals call upon him for instruction, but streams of foreigners left their homelands seeking his guidance. Especially renown among them we note <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, who was the very man famous in our day as the bishop <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> <a href=/people/10377 target=_blank>Thaumaturgus</a>, and his brother <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>. Although they were passionately devoted to Greek and Roman scholarship, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> stirred in them a love of divine philosophy and persuaded them to give up their former devotion in favor of rigorous theological study. After studying five full years, they made such great progress in divine matters that, although still young, both were considered deserving of the episcopate over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> churches. <br />During this period, the Commentaries on <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a> and likewise those on <a href=/people/4528 target=_blank>Ezekiel</a> were being composed by <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>. As to these works, there are thirty volumes on the third part of <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a> up to the vision of the beasts in the wilderness, and twenty-five on <a href=/people/4528 target=_blank>Ezekiel</a>, which were the only ones he wrote on the entire work of this prophet. He was sixty years old when he completed these labors — concerning which the blessed martyr <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> devoted his life in witness. His Commentaries on the Gospel of John indicate that he composed the first five parts while still in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>; however, only twenty-two volumes of this treatise, which encompassed the entire Gospel, have survived. He also composed twelve commentaries on Genesis, commentaries on the first twenty-five Psalms, and on Lamentations as well. Moreover, there are those works entitled On the Resurrection and First Principles. He also wrote compilations called the Stromateis, ten in number, which he composed during the reign of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. <br />In his discourse on the first Psalm, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> presented a catalogue of the holy books that comprise the Old Testament, commenting in effect: It must be clearly understood that there are twenty-two canonical books, as the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> attest, matching the number of letters in their alphabet. So he adds, saying: These are the twenty-two books according to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>: Genesis or βαρησιθ, which means 'In the beginning', and the subsequent sequence. <br /><a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> remained a clarion voice up to the period of <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> and Volusianus; that is, until be was sixty-nine years of age. He enjoyed final sleep in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, where he was also interred. His father <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> had been perfected by martydom through <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. (Tr: PAM LITTLE) </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg9010.tlg.001:omg.183'><b>&sect; omg.183</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ὠριγένης: <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>: [<a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>] had as his father <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a>, bishop and martyr, who attained perfection under the emperor <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>. Being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> devoted great zeal to the divine word. Many became his followers and especially <a href=/people/4059 target=_blank>Ambrosius</a>, who relinquished the heresies of <a href=/people/3712 target=_blank>Valentinus</a> and <a href=/people/4197 target=_blank>Marcion</a> in his eagerness to gain knowledge of him. Many non-Christian philosophers also studied with him and harvested great benefit. He was acknowledged as great by them, imparting geometry and arithmetic and the other preliminary studies. On that account, not a few of the philosophers among the Greeks mention him as a teacher. Precocious in childhood, at that time he was already disposed greatly to inquiry. As he understood the deepest meaning of the divine writings at a young age, his father repeatedly rebuked him lest he seek out matters beyond his years. When his father <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> stood over the boy at night and looked at him, he kissed the boy's breast as if a divine spirit were enshrined within it and blessed himself for his good fortune in parenthood. <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> practiced from his youth such holiness and continence that he was satisfied each day with only four obols for sustenance. Without question he continued doing this for many years. Lying on the ground on a rush mat, he slept a few hours of the night, spending the greater part in study of the Holy Scriptures. He continued on to such a degree with these practices, as well as mortifying himself with vigils and fasting and nakedness, that he completely overpowered the vigor of his body, so that he appeared to have withered away. Abstaining from wine and oil and other foodstuffs, he endured the greatest sloughing-off of the body. Then truly it became widely known how he was distinguished above all in both word and deed, and having persuaded many Hellenes to abominate the madness of idol worship, he readied the martyr's crown to be fitted upon him. With many reports flying about him and many flowing toward him from afar, not only did he draw to proper worship famous Hellenes, both philosophers and heretics, but he also ordered into closer formation those who were already <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. The aforesaid <a href=/people/4059 target=_blank>Ambrosius</a> often entreating him, and constraining [him to live] in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, providing seven stenographers to attend him and more calligraphers, made him interpret the holy texts. <a href=/people/4059 target=_blank>Ambrosius</a> also provided the necessities for his life. <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, being engaged in his studies, dictated to the stenographers, and the book scribes (along with women who were well-trained in calligraphy) wrote up [their notes]. He interpreted the whole of the Scripture in eighteen years. It is said that <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>'s oeuvre comprised six thousand books. <a href=/people/4059 target=_blank>Ambrosius</a> displayed such a zeal in regard to the interpretation of Scripture that <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a>, witnessing his repeated earnestness, wrote to some person, saying: The holy <a href=/people/4059 target=_blank>Ambrosius</a>, who is genuinely dedicated to God, sent many greetings. He, recognizing that I am a friend of God and that I thirsted exceedingly [for him], put me to shame with his own diligence in his love for learning. Whence, he outstripped me so far that [I] risked falling short of his hypotheses. It is neither the case that he does not converse while dining, nor, having dined, is it permitted to take walks and rest the body, but indeed at those times we are compelled to study and to make accurate copies. Nor are we permitted to sleep through the night for the health of the body, but more often he spent the time in arduous study. At dawn [we] read and from dawn until the ninth or tenth hour. All who are choosing to be industrious dedicate these times to the close examination of the Scriptures and to their reading. Thus he interpreted all of the holy text. During that time, running across the Old Testament in a storage jar in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a>, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> wisely and cleverly set this up. In the end, however, his renown did not remain unextinguished. There came for him an exceptional fall from the pinnacle of experience. And of course, he became a pitfall and a cause of destruction for many. Wishing that none of the Scripture remain unexplained, in the course of his work he cast himself into the attraction of sin and became the fomenter of deadly interpretations. For <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a> took from <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> his first propositions, and soon thereafter came the Anomoeans and unholy ones and all the rest. <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> dared to affirm that at the beginning, the Only-begotten Son was unable to see the Father, nor was the Holy Spirit able to see the Son, nor the angels the Holy Spirit, nor mankind the angels. Furthermore, he does not accept that the Son is from the essence of the Father, but is a created being, and was called Son by grace, that his human soul existed beforehand, and his other blasphemies one after the other. He certainly did make a fine composition in each of his works, and whenever he inquired into the nature of living things and animals in his introductory statements he carried himself impartially, many times writing graceful narratives. Whenever, though, he rendered opinions on faith, he has been found the most fallible of all. It was taught by him that one should undertake the ascetic life in this manner, as it was said that his body was ruined due to the excess of hunger and hard training. For he contrived against his body, some say to sever the member in order that he not be vexed by pleasure, others that he placed a drug on his genitals and withered them up, and others report other things about him. <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> is said to have suffered many tribulations on behalf of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, being exceedingly well-versed in the Word and reared up in the Church. Calumniated due to envy by the rulers of the world through the evil machination of diabolical thoughts, they say that he was attacked as a man of the greatest shame by these workers of wickedness. They prepared for him an Ethiopian for the abuse of his body. He, however, being unable to bear such a filthy idea screamed loudly, and with two choices put before him, he agreed to make a sacrifice. Carrying frankincense in his hands unto the altar he kindled a fire. And thus, by these choices, he was rejected from martyrdom by the judges and he was forced out of the Church. Leaving behind <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> on account of the disgrace, he seized upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>. Coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> as an exegete and learned man, he was persuaded by the priesthood to speak to the Church. He was previously a presbyter. Urged on by the bishops, he stood alone and said: God said to the sinner, 'Why do you recite my statutes and receive my covenant in your mouth?' When he folded up the book, he sat down, shedding tears and wailing, with all weeping alike with him. There are many other statements and praises about him due to the magnitude of this man's knowledge and the composition of the books. Whence he is called Syntacticus because he made many books, not heeding, apparently words of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> who said: Son, beware lest you write many books, and be not hasty with your mouth, and let your heart not hurry to carry a word from before the face of God. Because God is in heaven above and you are on earth below. Therefore let your words be few. Many words increase foolishness. Nor become overly righteous. The just man is slain in his righteousness. And, do not claim to know too much, lest you be impious. Having pushed aside all this, <a href=/people/1352 target=_blank>Origen</a> fell away from what was fitting.

He had a marvelous nature in all respects: his body was large and tall to look at, and his face was handsome and virtuous. At that time he had reached the age of greatest prudence, and was sociable and reasonably pleasant to those who met him. He was exceptionally helpful to those who followed his advice. No one had so hard and barbarous a soul that he was not persuaded and charmed by the words which flowed from his sacred mouth; for such a kind of persuasion sat on the lips of the man, not a human quality but rather divine. Thus he became a religious teacher for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, when they were being swept away by the torrent of society.

He was called <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> because when a war broke out between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=place long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophon</a> he was given as a hostage (homeros), or because when the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> were deliberating he spoke under divine inspiration and gave advice to their assembly advice about the war. And he lived 57 years before the institution of the first Olympiad; but <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyry</a> in the History of Philosophy says 132 years before. This was instituted 407 years after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>.

In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> he married Aresiphone the daughter of Gnostor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388269UCym class=person long=26.9363 lat=38.7595>Cyme</a>, and had two sons and a daughter, who was married to <a href=/people/6944 target=_blank>Stasinus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=person long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. The sons were Eriphon and Theolaus. <br />His undisputed poems are the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> and <a href=/people/12112 target=_blank>Odyssey</a>. He did not write the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> at one time or consecutively, as it now stands. He himself wrote and performed individual rhapsodies as he travelled round the cities for his livelihood, and left them behind; later they were put together and organised by numerous hands, especially <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Pisistratus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>' tyrant. Certain other poems are also attributed to him: Amazonia; <a href=/people/12275 target=_blank>Little Iliad</a>; <a href=/people/12255 target=_blank>Nostoi</a>; Epicichlides; Ethiepactos (or Iambi); Battle of the Frogs; Battle of the Mice and Frogs; Battle of the Spiders; Battle of the Cranes; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKer class=place long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Cerameis</a>; The Expulsion of <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>; Paegnia; The Capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; epithalamia; Cycle; hymns; <a href=/people/3573 target=_blank>Cypria</a>. <br />He died at an advanced age and was buried in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a>. He was blind from childhood; but the truth is that he was not a slave of desire or ruled by his eyes, and that is how the story of his being blind arose. Inscribed on his tomb was the elegy, composed by the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a> some time later: 'Here the earth covers the sacred head, divine <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, who marshalled heroic men.' <br />[B] <a href=/people/2405 target=_blank>Dioscorides</a> says in Customs in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> that the poet saw that moderation is the first and most appropriate virtue of the young, and is also fitting, and a chorus-master of what is good; and since too he aimed to implant it from the beginning onwards, so that they would devote their leisure and their efforts to fine deeds and do good to each other and share with one another, he gave to all of them a simple and self-sufficient way of life. He reasoned that desires and pleasures are strongest, first and indeed innate, when they are concerned with eating and drinking; those who abide by a simple regime are well-disciplined and self-controlled in all the rest of their life. So he has attributed a plain lifestyle to them all, the same alike for kings and for commoners; he says: Then she drew up a polished table for him, and the trusted house-keeper brought bread and put it by him; and the carver lifted platters of meat, and placed them by him. Now this meat, too, was roasted, and was for the most part beef. Except for this he never places before them anything, either at feasts or weddings or any other gathering. And yet he often portrays <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> entertaining the chiefs; and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> celebrates the wedding of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374232UHer class=place long=23.2535 lat=37.3834>Hermione</a> and his son and daughter, with <a href=/people/147 target=_blank>Telemachus</a> present as his guest as well: He took in his hands and set before them the roasted <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-chine that had been served to him as his portion. And <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> sacrifices <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> by the sea-shore through the sons who were his nearest and dearest, although he was a king and had many subjects, giving them these instructions: Come, let one of you go to the plain for a heifer. <a href=/people/10603 target=_blank>Alcinous</a>, too, feasting the extremely decadent <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a> and entertaining <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, shows him the way his garden and house are furnished, and then sets before him the same kind of meal. Even the suitors, though they were arrogant and devoted to pleasure, are not portrayed eating fish or birds or honey-cakes. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> makes every effort to eliminate the tricks of haute cuisine. <br />[C] About the poet <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: <br />(i) <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, being blind, travelled about. <br />(ii) He came to the shepherd <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, who took him to his own master. The latter, recognising his talent and wide experience, persuaded him to stay there and take charge of his children. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> did so, and composed <a href=/people/3195 target=_blank>Cercopes</a> and the Battle of Mice and Frogs and the Battle of the Starlings and Heptapacion and Epicichlides, and all his other paegnia, in Belissus in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>. <br />(iii) Then he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, and found a woman sacrificing to the Child-Rearer, and he uttered these lines: Hear my prayer, Child-Rearer, and grant that this woman renounce the love and bed of young men, and let her take pleasure in grey-templed old men whose 'tails' have lost their vigour, but whose spirit is undiminished. When he came to the place where the phratry was feasting they lit a fire, and <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> said: The crown of a man is his children, of a city its towers; <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> are a fine thing on the plain, ships on the sea; money increases a household; majestic kings seated in the market-place are a fine thing for others to see, but when a fire is burning a house is a more majestic sight. <br />(iv) This same <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, when he was about to sail and the sailors welcomed him, embarked on the boat and spoke these lines: Hear, mighty <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, earthshaker,... ruler of golden <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384228LHel class=place long=23.0154 lat=38.3207>Helicon</a> and its broad dancing-places, grant a fair wind and a homecoming with no grief to the sailors, who are the ship's escorts and rulers; and grant that when I come to the foot of high-cliffed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386265LMim class=place long=26.4695 lat=38.5885>Mimas</a> I may encounter respectful and holy men; and may I be avenged on the man who deceived me and angered <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> god of guests and the hospitable table. <br />(v) The same man, meeting some people who were about to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, asked them to take him on board; they did not accept him, and he spoke these lines: Sailors who travel the seas, resembling a hateful fate, like timorous diving-birds, living an unenviable life, respect majesty of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> god of guests, who rules on high; for terrible is the wrath of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> that follows when one offends. When the same man was resting for the night under a pine-tree, a fruit fell on him (what some people call a top, and others a cone); and he said this: Another pine shall bear better fruit, on the heights of windy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> with its many valleys; there shall be the best iron for men upon the earth, when the <a href=/people/12182 target=_blank>Cebriones</a> hold the land. <br />(vi) The same man, dining with <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, with the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> standing round and barking and eating, said this: <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a>, guardian of mortals, I shall set this word in your mind: first give the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> their dinner at the gate of the courtyard; for that is better. For it is the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> that first hears a man's approach or a wild beast coming to your fence. <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> was astonished when he heard that. <br />(vii) Some potters saw him when they were lighting their kiln to fire a pot; they called out to him, having heard that he was a wise man, and asked him to sing to them, promising to give him the pot. <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> sang them these lines (which are called The Kiln): If you will give me a reward for my song, o potters, come, good earth, and hold out your hand over the kiln; may the cups dry out well and all the holy things, and be well fired; and let them gain a dream of value, selling in large numbers in the market-place and in the streets, and bring a good profit, to us also, so as to sing them. But if you turn to shamelessness and are liars, then I convoke the destroyers of kilns to shatter them, Smasher and Inextinguishable and Shatterer and Subduer, who brings many ills on this craft. Start on the furnace and houses, and may the whole kiln be shaken as the potters wail loudly. As the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s jaw grinds so let the kiln grind, turning all the pottery inside it into tiny pieces. Here, too, daughter of the Sun, <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a> with many spells, cast cruel spells, and harm them and their works. Here let <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a> bring many <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a>, those that escaped <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>' hands and those that perished; let them give these things a terrible beating, let the kiln collapse; and let these people watch the mischief with groans. And I shall rejoice at the sight of their unfortunate craft. And if anyone stoops to peer in, let his whole face be burned, so that all know they should do right. <br />Spending the winter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, he visited the houses of the most distinguished people and was paid something for singing these lines (which are called <a href=/people/7628 target=_blank>Eiresione</a>). Some of the children of the local people acted as his guides and were always with him. We have reached the house of a man of great power, a man who shouts loudly, a man who roars loudly, always prosperous. Open yourselves up, doors. For great <a href=/people/923 target=_blank>Wealth</a> comes in, and with <a href=/people/923 target=_blank>Wealth</a> flourishing Joy and kind <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Peace</a>. May all the storage jars be full, may there always be bread with dinner. Now fair-faced barley flavoured with sesame ... Your son's wife will get down from her chair to sing, and swift-footed mules will bring her to this house. May she weave clothe as she treads on beds. With a nod ??? every year; it will be the swallow. It stands at your portals with a light foot. But come, quickly destroy with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s ???. And if you give something; but if not, we will not stay: we have not come here to live with you. This song was sung for a long time by children in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>. <br />He went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a>, and on the way he began to be ill; when he disembarked he rested on the beach for a number of day. Some fisher boys put in and got out of their boat; they came to him and said, Come, strangers, and listen to us; see if you can understand what we say to you. One of the bystanders told them to speak, and they said: What we caught, we left behind; what we didn't catch, we have with us. (Others say that they spoke in verse: Whate'er we caught we left behind; what we caught not, that we have.) The bystanders were not able to understand what had been said, and the boys explained that while they were fishing they had not been able to catch anything, but when they were sitting on the land they looked for lice; and they killed the lice they caught, but the ones they could not catch they were bringing home with them. When <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> heard this, he spoke these lines: From the blood of fathers like yourselves you are sprung, not from those with rich lands or countless flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. It so happened that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> died of this sickness in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a> — not, as some have supposed because he did not understand what the children had said, but because of his illness. He was buried in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a> on the shore, and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367253PIos class=place long=25.2822 lat=36.7233>Ios</a> put up this inscription: Here the earth covers the sacred head, divine <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, who marshalled heroic men. <br />His poetry became widely known, and was universally admired.

His doctrines concerning theogony are preserved, among them the following. He said that originally the aether was shown forth, having been fashioned by the god; and from that point chaos came from the aether, and fearsome night held everything down, and hid everything under the aether. Meaning the night had the advantage; he said the aether was something incomprehensible and was the highest of all things and more primeval and the supreme demiurge of all things. And he said the earth was invisible. But he said that the light shattered the aether and illuminated the earth and all its foundation, meaning the light is that supreme of all things, unapproachable, encompassing all. Which thing he named Will, Light, Life. These 3 names signified one and the same capacity and one power of the demiurgic god of all things, who leads all things from not-being into being, both seen and unseen. Concerning the race of men he said it too was fashioned by the demiurge god of all things, and that it had received a rational soul, following [sc. in this view] the doctrine of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>. He said the race of men was miserable and beset with many sufferings both spiritual and physical, receptive to both good and evil acts, and laboriously disposed concerning life's essentials.

People have become accustomed to apply the name of virtue to the business-hating life, but in my opinion it is not so. For the virtue which is involved in the midst of the community with political deeds and words exercises the soul towards greater strength and prepares it better for testing, insofar as it is healthy and unified; but insofar as baseness and falsity lurks in human lives, this all is examined and made more ready for correction. How much beneficial and useful is there in political activity? How great is boldness and confidence? Those learned men who sit in corners and philosophize at length very solemnly concerning justice and self-control make fools of themselves when they are forced to emerge into action. So every word which is not accompanied by deeds appears futile and empty. <a href=/people/498 target=_blank>Ulpian</a> became such a man while still young and ended his life unmarried, leaving much praise of his good character.

She became his wife, ignorant that she was also his mother. She bore him two sons, <a href=/people/542 target=_blank>Eteocles</a> and <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polyneices</a>; but later on when she learned that he was her son, she told this to her boy. When he heard that he took some nails and after fixing them in his eyes he died, leaving the kingdom to his two sons, who ruled for one year. But once they conceived a hatred of each other, they made war against each other, and <a href=/people/881 target=_blank>Polyneices</a>, pursued by <a href=/people/542 target=_blank>Eteocles</a>, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> and married the daughter of king <a href=/people/201 target=_blank>Adrastus</a>.

First, he was well-born, and was brought up and educated by Kleandros of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376224UMan class=person long=22.3933 lat=37.6181>Mantineia</a>, who happened to be a paternal guest-friend to them. Then, coming to adulthood, he became a devotee of Ekdemos and <a href=/people/11010 target=_blank>Demophanes</a>, who were from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=place long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a> but had fled the tyrants and came to live with the philosopher <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arkesilaos</a>. They collaborated in the deposition of <a href=/people/1269 target=_blank>Neokles</a>, tyrant of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyonians</a>. And he was careful about his way of life and plain in his external appearance. He had received from the aforesaid men opinions such as that it is not possible for a man who neglects the affairs of his own life to be a good leader in communal matters; nor, indeed, for a man who lives more luxuriously than his own availability of resource to refrain from grasping at the fatherland. Taking over a force of cavalrymen who were in every manner run down, and in which the very souls of the men were being defeated, he made them not only better than themselves, but also stronger than the enemy in a short time, embarking them upon real training and successful zeal. For most of the men appointed to this office — well, some through their personal lack of ability in cavalry matters do not even dare to give appropriate leadership in any matters to those around them, while others, aspiring to reach the generalship by way of this office, canvass support among the young men and prepare benevolent partisans for the future, not criticizing the man who needs it (by which practice communal interests are secured), [but] conniving at the covering up of mistakes and, through small-scale generosity, causing large-scale harm to those trusting in them. But if ever any of the rulers might be both capable in terms of bodily service and eager to refrain from grasping at the community's property, they commit more wrongs upon the infantry through their misplaced zeal than those who are neglectful, and even more to the cavalry. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arkadians</a> hold the memory of <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a> especially dear, because of both his wisdom and the deeds he dared. His father was Kraugis, a man second to none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arkadians</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=place long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a> in the fame of his lineage. When he died, he [<a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a>] kept company with, among other teachers, <a href=/people/7950 target=_blank>Megalophanes</a> and Ekdelos, pupils of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arkesilaos</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224DPit class=person long=22.4038 lat=37.0808>Pitane</a>. In size and in bodily strength he was second to none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a>, but in facial appearance he was ugly. He thought himself above training for contests for which garlands were awarded, but in working the land he owned he did not neglect to remove the wild beasts. He also used to read books by the distinguished wise men of the Hellenes, and those to do with war, and any that he knew contained teaching about stratagems, wishing to make his entire life an imitation of the wisdom of <a href=/people/798 target=_blank>Epameinondas</a> and of that man's deeds, though he was not able to equal him in all things: for <a href=/people/798 target=_blank>Epameinondas</a>, among other things, had a soul that was particularly mild in the matter of anger, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arkadian</a> had a certain tendency towards rage. When <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Kleomenes</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=place long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a>, <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a> was not at all stricken by the unexpected nature of the calamity, but rescued about two parts of the adult males, plus women and children, and took them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372219PMes class=place long=21.9195 lat=37.1779>Messene</a>. When <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Kleomenes</a> announced that he was now repenting of his daring act and wished to lead the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=ethnic long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolitans</a> back to their own land, <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a> persuaded them to make good their return by means of weapons and not a truce. When the battle against <a href=/people/81 target=_blank>Kleomenes</a> took place, <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a>, though assigned to the cavalry, saw that the infantry was being left behind and voluntarily became a hoplite. As he faced danger in a valorous manner one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> pierced him through both thighs. But <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a>, even though handicapped in this way, bent his knees and made his way forwards by force, with the result that he actually snapped the spear by the movement of his legs. After the victory, when he was carried to the camp, the doctors there drew it out of both thighs: the butt-spike in one direction, the blade in the other. And <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonos</a>, when he saw <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a>'s daring acts, was eager to take him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>. <a href=/people/3659 target=_blank>Philopoimen</a> was not interested in him at all, but crossed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> as a mercenary leader, returned again to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374221PMeg class=place long=22.1273 lat=37.4124>Megalopolis</a>, and was chosen to lead the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaians</a>.

In origin he was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=demonym long=32.641 lat=25.684>Theban</a>, one of those from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Taking advantage of a nature apt for everything, he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and having been chosen as a grammar-teacher by the city, he taught for many years and was taught at the same time, in more philosophical topics, by the great <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a>. When a scandal arose for him against a certain <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> among those who were there, insulted by him and tested by him with more knavery than a teacher should be, he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. In other respects he appeared a good and worthy man, but as in a city holding all <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> the pagan [element] of religion did not have an answer, but was informed against openly with free speech, which led to suspicion of knowing also other aspects of the secret wisdom. <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> the magister [officiorum] accepted him willingly as an associate, and honored him for brilliantly reading a certain poem in public, and gave him a subsidy both himself personally and also from the public funds as a teacher. And when he went away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a>, those who envied him concocted an accusation both from his religion and that he used magic and gave prophecies to <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> against the emperor. They persuaded <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> and Verina who had then the greatest influence to expel [him] from the city. And he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamum</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RMys class=place long=28 lat=40>Mysia</a>; but <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> learning that they had exiled the man according to his pretext, sent and brought him back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a> and made him an adviser and a member of his household, and (for he was full of political sagacity) both entrusted to him to handle the official business for which he did not have time and when he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> took him along. And when the conspiracy of <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> occurred, he himself encouraged <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> when he was at a loss, and saying something such as the matters of foresight are arranged with us, he provided suspicion to those who were in earshot that he prophesied these things by some secret foreknowledge. And when the end happened, as indeed it happened, comparing his word with the chance, they took him alone as responsible for everything (as the crowd is accustomed to do) for what seemed to them to have turned out unexpectedly. Thus the prudent people speculated about him. If there was anything else, I am not able to confute it with certainty or to believe it; nevertheless great matter and least matter was shared with him first. And then taking him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a> he arrived to spend the winter, either avoiding the ill-will of the people or wishing to escape for a little while the divinity then holding the city at the sacrifices. <br />[Note] that <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a>, being a lover of literature, wanted to hear a detailed speech about the soul in the presence of literary men. When many happened by at his request and philosophized in various manners, since the discourse appeared to lack cohesion because of the discord [among the speakers], <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> said that <a href=/people/6750 target=_blank>Pamprepius</a> could resolve the problem faultlessly. This man was dark-skinned, unpleasant in appearance, a grammarian by profession, originating from <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>[opolis] in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, having spent a long time in Greece because of intermarriage. So having been brought by <a href=/people/4199 target=_blank>Marsus</a> to <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> and going through a speech on the soul cleverly thought out some time before, since he who does not know is more convincing than he who knows to those who do not know, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> said, <a href=/people/4570 target=_blank>Illous</a> being tricked by his highly-wrought wordiness, judged him more eloquent than all those educated at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. For this reason he gave him much comfort from the public funds, and bade him to teach as he chose those who came to the schools. So his good fortune making such a start became the cause of many misfortunes for the community. <a href=/people/6750 target=_blank>Pamprepius</a> was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>. Being poetically inclined and suited by nature for poetry, he arrived also at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, obtaining the necessities of life by his practice of poetry. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> made him a grammarian and appointed him a teacher for the youth. But he, being ambitious and wanting to appear second to none, was contentious with all except only <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> and the other philosophers. But he was not capable even of touching wisdom. So concerning other preparatory studies <a href=/people/6750 target=_blank>Pamprepius</a> worked so hard and practiced so much that in a short time he seemed to be the most eloquent and learned of those involved with education in that place, of <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> the son of Hierios, an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> man, and of <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermeias</a> the rhetor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, whose reputation for learning he had striven to surpass. So he was so far honored by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, as a not unworthy teacher; but after this came a beginning for him of other matters very great and very bad, so that we may learn that the changes of fortune test the various choices of souls at all times and not less than one sympotic inebriation.

In the time of the persecutions one of his eyes was put out. The emperor used to summon him and kiss his eye.

And he called the intercourse with one's lawful wife 'chastity'; it was sufficient for one who had attained the rank of the clergy no longer to enter into marriage, according to the ancient tradition of the church, but not to be separated from her with whom already earlier he had joined in a single marriage while a layman. And he said this, having no experience of marriage or — to speak plainly — of any woman; for from childhood he had been raised among ascetics and was renowned for chastity more than any other. And the whole assembly of the clergy was persuaded by <a href=/people/8097 target=_blank>Paphnutius</a>' words, and they silenced the inquiry concerning this matter, leaving it to the judgment of those who wished to abstain from intercourse with their wives.

It increased in later times as devoted and learned men died at one time or another and in their wills left to those practicing philosophy a resource for the philosophic life of leisure and calm. <br /><a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in Laws says that the soul is free and mistress of the passions. To conquer oneself is the first and best of all conquests, whereas to defeat oneself by one's own effort is the most shameful and worst [of defeats]. We know that the passions, like certain sinews and cords that are in us, draw us and drag us contrary to one another, certain actions being opposed to opposite actions. Precisely in this respect virtue and vice [do not] lie distinguished from one another, for the logic of our argument says each person ought, following always one of the powers that attract and never leaving, to resist the other impulses; and this is the leading of reason. The sage moreover has shown how he has assigned to the will of the soul the power to distinguish between the better and the worse. The selfsame <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> has said as he discoursed on divine matters: What is that which always has being, though it has no beginning, and what is that which is always beginning, but never has being? The one is comprehensible by the understanding of reason, for it is always the same, the other, accessible through conjecture by irrational perception, becoming and passing away, but never really existing. All of these are a portion of time, that which was and is and will be which we unwittingly apply to the invincible essence, but erroneously; you see we say that it was, is, and will be. The term 'is', in accordance with true reasoning, is only applicable to God, whereas 'was' and 'will be' are fittingly spoken that which comes about in time, whereas that which is eternally, immoveably the same ought not be called either newer or older. And that which is eternally and preceding is superior to all coming into being, whereas that which comes into being and is subject to many alterations, he reasonably said, never exists. And again the same <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> said, God is good in reality and must be said to be responsible for good things but not responsible for any evils. He himself, having showed us in the Laws the presidency of the whole, said that God has taken the tillers of all things; God, you see, holding the beginning, middle, and end of all things, advances straight on as he proceeds around according to nature, and justice always accompanies him as a chastiser of those who depart from the divine law. The one who is going to be happy adheres [to it] and follows humble and orderly, but the one arrogantly exalted, elevated either by wealth or public offices or by beauty of body, burns alike with impetuosity and senselessness accompanied by pride, as though not in need of someone to control him or lead him but rather as though he were able to lead others, is abandoned devoid of God, yet, though abandoned, taking others like himself, bounds along confusing everything and has seemed to many to be somebody, but after a time has provided no trifling penalty to justice and overthrown himself and his house and his city. On this account the philosopher has shown both the guardian of the whole and the his long-suffering regarding certain ones and the disgrace that attaches to the senseless and the utter ruin that later is brought upon them. He himself in the <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> reveals the causes of the punishment, speaking thus: It is befitting for someone subject to punishment at the hands of one who rightly punishes him either to become better and to profit really in some respect or to become an example to others, so that they, seeing him suffer what he suffers, out of fear will become better. Those who are helped by paying the penalty at the hands of God and men commit sins that are curable. Through sufferings and pains benefit accrues to them alike here and in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, for it is not otherwise possible for them to be rid of injustice. However those who commit extreme acts of injustice and become incurable, become examples here, and these no longer profit at all, since they are incurable, but others profit by seeing them undergoing the most painful and fearful sufferings on account of these sins and simply and being held up as accessible through conjecture by irrational perception examples continually. These concepts he seems to have plundered from the divine scriptures, spoken by <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> under divine inspiration to Pharoah: I have roused you up to this, so that I may show in you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth. For God inflicted all sorts of punishments on him since he was utterly evil, not so that he could make him better [for he knew that his mind was stubborn and his illness incurable], but so that the tales about him would be examples, just as cities maintain executioners, not that they commend their vocation but that they tolerate their services because of necessity, and so forth as is manifest [from what has been said]. The very same man says in the <a href=/people/1077 target=_blank>Phaedo</a> concerning the assignment and apportionment by lot of souls: The one who is uninitiated and unpurified, on arrival in <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>, lies in mire, whereas the one who has been initiated and purified upon moving there will dwell with the gods. And elsewhere: The one who has passed through life justly and innocently upon death will go to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000GEly class=place long=23.73603 lat=37.96393>Isles of the Blessed</a> to dwell in all happiness free of evil, but the one who has lived unjustly and godlessly will go to the dungeon of judgment and retribution, which they call <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>.

Insects do not breathe, nor do animals without blood nor any of the amphibious animals have a voice nor do the molluscs, such as the land-snails, nor the crustaceans, such as crabs [and] skytalai. But of the amphibious animals, the hippopotamus and crocodile do have a voice; for this one has a voice briefly.

For they do not have a voice through phonetic organs, but [that sound is due to] a certain movement of their gills. Effectively, when they swim in the surface of water, they enclose a lot of it in their gills; and then, when they contract their gills, they send out the water and disturb their sending out. But what is disturbed encloses a certain air which, when squeezed out, sounds with the stroke, and so [the fishes] seem to have a voice. The cicadas, on account of a membrane implanted in the surface underneath their breast, have a voice when they squeeze that membrane out and the air is agitated by their wings. In fact, they have no voice through phonetic organs. But flies strike the air with their wings, which are rough, and produce a sound. Indeed, when they stand still, they do not make a humming noise any longer. And the parrot-wrasses, when squirting water out through the mouth, produce a piping sound; doubtless when they are in the deeps they have no voice.

But all the others [sc. other biographers] attribute both some luck and always more guesswork in deliberation when embarking upon his projects, regarding such men to be more divine and wondrous than those who engage in each task according to reason, not recognizing that among the aforementioned, although one is praiseworthy, to be but enviable coincides with the other. And, although it is also common to those in lucky circumstances, praiseworthiness itself is to belong solely to men of good judgment and possessing sensibility, and whom are to be regarded most divine and beloved by the gods. To me, Publius seems, says <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a>, to have borne a close resemblance in character and predisposition to <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, the lawgiver of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>. For neither must one suppose <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> to have composed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> constitution by superstitious fears and all the promptings by the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a>, nor Publius to have preserved so great a dynasty for his fatherland by being motivated out of dreams and omens. But both of them seeing most of mankind not ready to accept the unfamiliar nor to partake in challenging endeavors without hope from the gods, <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, on the one hand, having always augmented his own projects with the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a>'s prophesy, made his own plans more acceptable and trustworthy, while quite similarly Publius, on the other hand, constructing his projects as if they came from divine inspiration, prepared with better courage the ranks of his men for the challenges of their duties. By calculation and foresight and all according to reason he carried out his own tasks as attempted. For it is agreed upon that this man was beneficent and magnanimous, yet shrewd and sober, with an intense concentration about a given proposition, as would be confirmed by no one more than those who have lived with him and have held up his character to the light and examined it. Gaius <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> was one of them, taking part with him in every deed and word from [sc. Publius'] youth until death, he elaborated this belief about him by speaking with evident candor and consonance to the man's endeavors. <br />To the first Publius, after a retaliatory ambush successfully occurred, a crown of green <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>'s tooth grass was given by the Romans. <br />Once some young men among the Romans, having struck up the acquaintance of a maiden surpassing other women in refinement and beauty, and, conscious of Publius being fond of women, they came bringing her along, and having introduced her, announced the girl to be a gift to him. Struck and amazed by her beauty, he declared that while being a private soldier nothing would be more delightful than to accept such a gift, yet upon becoming a general nothing so much is worse, by his refusal hinting that while sometimes such things in living as respite and relaxation provide most delightful enjoyments to young men, yet at the most critical times of engagement they become an impediment to the spirit and body for those who indulged. He said he indeed held gratitude toward the young men, but, having summoned the maiden's father and having handed her over, entreated [sc. the father] to marry her to whomever he were to select among the citizens. Through these, exhibiting both empowerment and moderation, he garnered a great respect from the ranks of his men. (Tr: RONALD ALLEN) </p>                        </div>

The amount agreed to in the forged writings came to no less than 100 centenaria. There was also a man who had an office in the forum in those days when Mam[m]ianus was living who had a high reputation for honesty and character. This man used to notarize the writings of the citizens, personally putting a seal on each of them with his own handwriting, the sort the Romans call a tabellio. Fiendishly imitating this man's writings he gave them to those who managed the affairs of the church of the Emesenes, after they had agreed to set aside for him a certain portion of the money obtained in this fashion. But since they were impeded by a law that set a thirty-year limit to all other sorts of cases, but for a few, including all those related to mortgages, dismissed those of 40 years length, they went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, and having offered money to the emperor <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, persuaded him without the least to-do to write a law, [to the effect] that the churches would be excluded from the cases pertaining to them not in the proper times, but for a period of 100 years.

The gift of the diabolical is for worshippers of the devil only, for of this type are flour-diviners and barley-diviners, the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> and the priestess of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod class=place long=20.7878 lat=39.5464>Dodona</a> who divine through trees or those who divine through entrails and the flights of birds and the augury of sounds and sneezes and words of omen and thunder and <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> and polecats and the squeaks of wood and the ringing of the ears and the twitching of the mouth and through the names of the dead and the stars and the waters and other countless things. The interpretation of dreams is [practiced] among us also, and is also [accomplished] by inspiration. For them foresight did not come from virtue, as with us, but from some bad art. God foretells and gives the interpretation, and the conclusion is reached with full precision. But they sometimes speak truth by chance but fail for the most part. The natural [kind of prophecy] comes from irrational animals: for swallows and cranes and ants can sense the coming winter, as well as hedgehogs and kingfishers; they get this from nature. The art of prophecy by skill is for doctors and augurs and helmsmen, for doctors foretell sicknesses and their cures, helmsmen predict the changes of winds, and augurs guess the future by some understanding. The common and vulgar knowledge of the future [is] such as that winter will come after three months, for everyone can predict from the regular cycles. It is nothing great for demons to know the future, since in some places the ants have that gift and men are clever guessers of the future. But they do not know everything always, since the devil prophesied about the knowledge of good and evil, and it happened. And <a href=/people/7355 target=_blank>Balaam</a> foretold that [they should] stop the prostitutes and that <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> would be betrayed because of them; and thus it happened. This is guesswork rather than foresight, for such prophecies have nothing remarkable about them. <br />A characteristic of prophecy [is] proffering the tongue ready for service to the grace of the Spirit.

He indeed [maintained] that he kept in contact with the gods and was learning from them how they are pleased by humans and how are they displeased. It was from that very source that he used to say about nature that while the others try to fathom the divine on the ground of conjectures and elaborate opinions quite dissimilar to each other, to him <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> came in person, admitting his identity; moreover, accompanying him — but not admitting [their identities] — were <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> and other deities, whose aspect and names were still unknown to mankind.

After having conspiratorially destroyed the regime called that of the <a href=/people/5501 target=_blank>Basilidae</a>, he emerged as a very harsh tyrant. To the people and the [sc.] wider masses he seemed to be — and was — a source of gratification, simultaneously buoying up their hopes with promises while distributing to them only meagre profits; at any rate, for those who enjoyed prestige and power he was completely unendurable, since he plundered and confiscated their properties. But he also did not hesitate to punish innocent people in the harshest ways and to have them killed without the slightest mercy; for his madness reached such a point; and his passion for money [was] limitless; and he was very susceptible to slanders leveled against the people close to him. That would have been sufficient for him to perish in the worst way on earth, but besides, he also showed disrespect for religion. At any rate, very many of the previously-mentioned people, whom he moved against, he killed in the temples. However he did not dare to take by force the daughter of one of these men, who had sought refuge in the sanctuary, but he had her put under constant surveillance and exhausted her to the point that [sc. only] by hanging herself did the girl escape from hunger. Accordingly what followed was a community-wide plague and food-shortage; and <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, very concerned for himself, sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> and sought a solution of the misfortunes.

This man came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidoros</a> the philosopher. <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a>' manner was paradoxical to everyone — in philosophizing, he was too weighty, and in joking, he was too ridiculous. In each, I think, he went beyond the mean; and judgment is necessary in this way of life more than any other. On his father's side, <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> originated from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, but on his mother's side he had been an Emesene. His father was named <a href=/people/5500 target=_blank>Basilides</a>, and his mother was Theokleia. He was naturally able in many respects, and his character was austere and ambitious. At first he looked towards the accursed field of law and was educated in rhetoric by <a href=/people/7665 target=_blank>Eunoios</a> the sophist, who was then at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a>. But later he directed his mind no longer to the legal field but to the sophistic life and diligently practiced speeches for this, being not less amazing in his effort than in his natural ability: for he memorized all the public speeches of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. But in addition to this he was an adequate [extemporaneous] speaker, not imitating the more recent sophists, but associating with the ancient patina of speech-writing. And indeed he wrote speeches, not falling much short of those. He recounted that my fellow-citizen <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, the companion of <a href=/people/7665 target=_blank>Eunoios</a>, had memorized the 8 books of <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>' history, yet did not say anything worth hearing. And he said that Nonnos had memorized all of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> six times, yet was not able to open his mouth for the composition of reasonable speeches. For it is not the same thing to repeat by heart for the crowd and to write for beauty. But <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> having already progressed more grandly in the art, thinking that <a href=/people/7665 target=_blank>Eunoios</a> was less than he needed, departed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> and made trial of the rhetorical schools.

Deficient in no sort of virtue; for [he was inferior] to none — not only of the people of his own time, but he was even worthy of being compared to those of old, and to those who had the most excellent reputation among them in every respect. Though he was eager for battle he was not at all eager for risk, not for his own sake but for the sake of those in his command. His concern for a large amount of money extended only so far as his intention to adorn his body with weapons. The food he preferred was hard and rough, and as much as sufficed for his labors, but not so much as to be a hindrance to him as he set out on those labors. Though he was an exceptional champion of the rank-and-file he was not indulgent to his soldiers. Instead he stripped them of every sort of greediness toward things from home and turned their acquisitiveness against the enemy. He severely punished those who disregarded these rules, but for those who tried to follow them he struggled alongside them to make it a reality. To put it simply, he provided himself as a model and prototype of virtue.

[<a href=/people/3960 target=_blank>Severianus</a> came] from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, of one of the foremost families, son of <a href=/people/8939 target=_blank>Auxentios</a> the son of Kallinikos, descended from Roman ancestors who settled in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=demonym long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrian</a> country. He obtained an education befitting his natural acuity, in poetry and rhetoric; but also spending time on the laws of the Romans, he seemed to surpass his contemporaries. He was stubborn in his character and rushed to accomplish whatever came to his mind; he outstripped his deliberation with action. And because of this his life was a failure in many ways. For at first he was eager to turn to philosophy and, presenting himself to <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a>, to entrust himself to him. At that time <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proklos</a> was in his prime and was flourishing at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. But his father became a hindrance to him; for he wanted him to give judgments and to make money from this profitable profession. His father soon died, but he himself setting out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> beheld a dream of this kind: he seemed to be sitting on the ridge of some mountain as if on a chariot and to be (as it were) driving the mountain. But fate led him according to necessity and also his own choice (which was bad), into another way of life, one which seemed to be lofty and magnificent, but [was actually] harsh and pointless. He himself chose this, and the experience of the outcome proved it — — for instead of philosophy and fortunate leisure he drove himself into politics and public administration. Being fond of controversy by nature and unwilling to be defeated in whatever he undertook, and ambitious, more than any other I know, yet through honorable deeds and words and bringing virtue out of his soul, he spent no time on money-making, nor was he spontaneously prone to injustice or greed, but he was always offensive and contentious towards his superiors, and did not think it right for any of the greater magistrates to go beyond what the accepted bounds of justice. In judging he was very harsh. And sometimes indeed, being led astray by anger and by the desire not to be regarded lightly, he brought about some deaths which brought pollution and misfortune; to these he attributed the cause of the misfortune in life which came upon him later. He even gave offense to Ardabur (the son of Aspar, a barbarian man who had great influence with the emperor) who was general of the eastern forces, he gave great difficulties to this man and to his father. Having endured more and worse sufferings and violence he gained no benefit from this interference, but being excessively pious and Greek, the wretched man did not yield in spite of many threats and fears. To me he explained the greater and more political speeches of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isokrates</a>, not in the technical and sophistic manner, but in the wise and philosophical. Then I saw a man of good sense and able in intelligence for political explanations, but also an excellent judge of what was said. He sharpened my younger brother <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> so much for literature that he was prepared to memorize both poetry and the approved passages of the orators. As the wages of his eagerness he offered the prize which befits a companion: dinner. The works of the other poets he accepted in moderation, but when he took <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> into his hands, there was no way he did not ridicule the Libyan poet; being very much irritated, often he even spat into the book. <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> the emperor promised him the greatest authority after the emperor if he became an adherent of the prevailing [religion]. But not even thus did he persuade him, nor was he likely to persuade. To us he read the letter which conveyed the promise and failed to persuade. And he censured Arkadios of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=person long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larissa</a> by a letter. For <a href=/people/3960 target=_blank>Severianus</a> was a masterful and wise letter-writer, as it is possible for anyone to learn who happens on the man's letters.

But the other [Sibyls] agree with her, except that there are 24 books of hers, covering every race and region. As for the fact that her verses are unfinished and unmetrical, the fault is not that of the prophetess but of the shorthand-writers, unable to keep up with the rush of her speech or else uneducated and illiterate; for her remembrance of what she had said faded along with the inspiration. And on account of this the verses appear incomplete and the train of thought clumsy — even if this happened by divine management, so that her oracles would not be understood by the unworthy masses. <br />[Note] that there were Sibyls in different places and times and they numbered ten. First then was the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaean</a> <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibyl</a>, also [known as] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, who was called <a href=/people/8263 target=_blank>Sambethe</a> by name. Second was the Libyan. Third was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphian</a>, the one born in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>.

Fifth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=person long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraian</a>, who prophesied about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. Sixth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, whose proper name was <a href=/people/8176 target=_blank>Phyto</a>; <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> wrote about her. Seventh was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=person long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumaean</a>, also [called] Amalthia and also Hierophile. Eighth was the Hellespontian, born in the village of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399265UMar class=place long=26.511 lat=39.897>Marmissos</a> near the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399266UGer class=place long=26.6055 lat=39.9075>Gergition</a> — which were once in the territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399263RTro class=place long=26.27 lat=39.915>Troad</a> — in the time of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> and <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>. Ninth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>. Tenth was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=person long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tiburtine</a>, Abounaia by name. They say that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=person long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumaean</a> brought nine books of her own oracles to Tarquinus <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>, then the king of the Romans; and when he did not approve, she burned two books. [Note] that <a href=/people/373 target=_blank>Sibylla</a> is a Roman word, interpreted as prophetess, or rather seer; hence female seers were called by this one name. Sibyls, therefore, as many have written, were born in different times and places and numbered ten. (Tr: JENNIFER BENEDICT) </p>                        </div>

He concerned himself especially with dialectic, so that even <a href=/people/2741 target=_blank>Eunomios</a> the heretic often avoided dialogue with him. He did not have a simple life-style, but with the height of self-control he lived expensively, both habitually luxuriating in white garments and two or three times a day bathing at the public baths. And when once someone asked him, why, being a bishop, he bathed twice a day, he answered, because he could not manage a third time. At another time visiting the bishop <a href=/people/8887 target=_blank>Arsacius</a> out of respect, he was asked by one of Arsaciu' followers why he wore a garment unsuitable for a bishop, and Where is it written, that a man in priestly orders should wear white? He said, First you tell me where it is written that a bishop should wear a black garment. And when the questioner was puzzled about his reply, <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> added, But you will not be able to prove that a man in priestly orders should wear black; but even <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> has advised me, saying, 'Let your cloaks be white.' And the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> in the Gospels appears wearing a white garment.

But he replied hotly and said, You Novatians ought not have a church, since you take away repentance and shut off the loving-kindness of God. But <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> said, Truly, no one repents like me. When [<a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>] asked in return, How do you repent? <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> said, That I visited you. When John the bishop said that a city cannot have two bishops, <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> said, It does not. When John became annoyed and said, You see, because you want to be the only bishop? And <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> said, I am not saying this, but that with you alone I am not a bishop, I who am [a bishop] for everyone else. But John said, I will stop you from preaching, for you are a heretic. But <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> wittily said, But I will pay you, if you relieve me from such great toil. But John being softened said, I will not stop you from preaching, if indeed speaking gives you distress. So witty was <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a>. He wrote many things, and in them he hunts for [clever] words. He impressed people more by speaking than by being read, for there was such grace in his countenance and his voice and his glance and in the whole movement of his body.

He was self-controlled in his way of life, so as to be above criticism; but in his lifestyle luxurious and diverse, so those who did not know him doubted whether he could practice self-control in the midst of such luxury. His character was witty and pleasant in conversation, and because of this he was liked by the bishops of the catholic church and by those with political authority and literary accomplishment. He was very well able to tease with grace and to accept teasing and to remain free of hatred and to reply cleverly and quickly to questions. So when once someone asked him, why, being a bishop, he bathed twice a day, he answered, because he couldn't manage a third time.

When [<a href=/people/972 target=_blank>Leontios</a>] asked in return, How do you repent? <a href=/people/2664 target=_blank>Sisinnios</a> answered, That I am visiting you.

So he stole animals even from <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a>, and changed them, but he did not fool <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a>, who recognized them from the monograms. Once <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a> had been propitiated in the matter, [<a href=/people/1000 target=_blank>Autolycus</a>] entertained him and provided his own daughter <a href=/people/5370 target=_blank>Anticlea</a> as his bedmate; a pregnancy resulted, and the daughter born to them was given in marriage to <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>; hence <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> [was of the line] of <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a>.

He was envied because most of the young men were erotically attracted to him. And first <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> wrote a comedy, the Clouds, against him, charging that he corrupted the youth and was an atheist, because he swore by 'the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>' and 'the plane-tree' in an exaggeration of religiosity. Finally <a href=/people/835 target=_blank>Anytus</a> and <a href=/people/746 target=_blank>Meletus</a> indicted him on these charges and won their case.

And it was not allowed, once the ship had set sail until it returned to port, for anyone to be judicially executed. Although <a href=/people/482 target=_blank>Crito</a> proposed exile for him, he rejected the idea, for he said that one ought not to violate the laws. When he had drunk the hemlock, he recalled a vow he had made and said, 'Sacrifice to <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>'. A man by the name of Cyrsas, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a> stock, came to associate with <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>.

But the other means — anything beyond this — [they were] to regard as no-means, such as the theoric monies and the jurors' pay. So his recommendation is to allocate all expense entailed in these areas to the [war]ships. (Tr: DAVID WHITEHEAD) </p>                        </div>

He was just past the age of an ephebe, and had just reached the prime of his strength. Although he was chaste, his stepmother fell in love and pressured him and made his father harsh [towards him], plotting nothing like <a href=/people/953 target=_blank>Phaedra</a>, but slandering him as effeminate and delighting in lover-boys rather than women. But he left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=place long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a> and spent his time around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> and had already obtained a ship and was working as a waterman on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. So when he saw <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> sailing upstream, as he himself was sailing downstream, he recognized that the crew consisted of wise men, inferring [this] by the cloaks and the books, in which they were deeply engaged, and he begged them to grant him a share of their voyage, since he was a lover of wisdom. But <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said, This young man is prudent, and let him be judged worthy of what he asks. And he recounted the story about the stepmother in a low tone to those of his companions who were near, as the youth was still sailing towards them. But as the boats came together, <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> went across and after saying something to his steersman about the cargo, he addressed the men. So <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, bidding him to take a seat in his sight, said, Egyptian boy, for you appear to be one of the local people, say what you have done bad or good: so that of the former release may come to you from me because of your age, but for the latter having earned praise you may join in philosophy with me and these men. But seeing <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> blushing and checking the impulse of his mouth to say something or not, at once he pressed his inquiry, as if using no foreknowledge in his regard. But <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> took courage and said, O gods, whom may I call myself? For I am not a bad man, but whether it is right to consider myself good, I do not know. For it is not yet praiseworthy not to do wrong. And <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> said, Babai, young man, you converse with me as if from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, for the divine <a href=/people/1186 target=_blank>Iarchas</a> holds the same opinion. But how do you judge this, and from what? For you look like a person guarding himself against sinning in some way. But when he began to tell how his stepmother came against him, but he avoided her in her infatuation, a cry arose at how marvelously <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> had foretold these events. But replying <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> said, O best of men, what has happened to you? For the things I have said are as far from wonder as from laughter. And <a href=/people/195 target=_blank>Damis</a> said, We wondered at something else, which you do not yet know. And we praise you, young man, because you do not think that you have accomplished anything outstanding. But do you sacrifice to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, young man? <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> asked him. And <a href=/people/1255 target=_blank>Timasion</a> said, By <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, [yes], indeed every day; for I consider the goddess great in both human and divine matters. So <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> with great delight said, Let us vote thus, that he should be crowned for chastity even before <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> the son of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>; for he acted insolently towards <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and perhaps for this reason was not subdued by sexual pleasures nor did any love revel over him, but he belonged to the more rustic and hard-hearted part. But this [youth] here saying that he/she had been overcome by the goddess suffered nothing towards the infatuated woman, but went away, fearing the goddess herself if he did not guard himself against loving wrongly. And the very fact of opposing any one of the gods, as <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> did <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, I do not judge to be prudence/chastity; for it is more prudent to speak well about all the gods, and especially at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, where altars are set up for unknown divinities. [...] But he called him <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a> because of the eyes with which he saw his stepmother. (Tr: CATHARINE ROTH) </p>                        </div>

For having been sent into exile from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> by <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, he did not have the power to retaliate against the dynast while the latter was alive, but when he had died [<a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaios</a>] defamed him, through his history, for all time. For in general, to the already-existing bad qualities that this king had, [<a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaios</a>] added many others of his own devising. He took away his successes, and the failures — not only the ones actually brought about by him but also the fortuitous ones — he transferred to the man in no way to blame for them. By common consent [<a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>] was both shrewd as a military strategist and decisive and bold when it came to the dangers of battle, but [<a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaios</a>] ignored no opportunity, throughout the entirety of the history, to call him spineless and cowardly. And yet who does not know that, of all men who have ever become dynasts, nobody acquired a greater kingdom with fewer resources? For having been reared from childhood as an artisan, because of restricted means and undistinguished parentage, he later, through his own excellence, not only became lord of [almost] the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> but also reduced by force of arms much of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. Anyone would marvel at the historian's irresponsibility: for throughout the entirety of the history he praises the courage of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=ethnic long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusans</a>, but says that the man who mastered them surpassed in cowardice the whole of mankind. Thanks to the proofs that these contradictions furnish, [<a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaios</a>] is plainly someone who, for the sake of personal hatred and contentiousness, has betrayed his historian's standard: truth-loving candour. Hence the final 5 books of this writer's account, the ones in which he has covered the doings of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, nobody could fairly accept.

This man inherited his office from his father. Being unwarlike and cowardly throughout his life and gaining peace by bribery rather than by force of arms, he procured many misfortunes for the Roman state. Since he was raised by eunuchs, he was obedient to their every command. As a result, men chosen for positions of authority required their support and there was much turmoil in political and military affairs. Since men who were able to manage serious affairs were absent, while those providing money held sway, the greediness of the eunuchs and the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piratical</a> gang of Sebastian's mercenaries threw the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408280WPro class=place long=28 lat=40.75>Propontis</a> into confusion. At this point the eunuchs prepared distractions to sooth <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, just as children are soothed with toys, although nothing in their successful intrigues is worthy of memory. <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> lived to the age of 50, trafficking with certain disreputable artisans and devoting himself to the hunt. As a result, the eunuchs and Chrysaphius held imperial power — although Pulcheria pursued it after her brother died. <br />A bronze statue of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> on horseback was placed in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290BMil class=place long=28.97807 lat=41.00804>Milion</a>. When <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> erected the statue, he liberally dispensed much free grain in the city. <br />It is uncertain which <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> did this. <br />After deposing <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> the younger appointed his Chamberlain <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> to the Senate and had him assume authority and occupy the two most important official positions simultaneously. Marveling at such great success, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> blurted out the following: 'o fortune, you do me no favors, when you smile so sweetly!' At any rate he was overthrown on the grounds that he sought the imperial power and had pagan leanings. After his property was confiscated, he became a bishop in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394300UKot class=place long=29.983 lat=39.415>Cotyaeum</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>.

[She was] the wife of <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> the philosopher. She flourished in the reign of <a href=/people/4862 target=_blank>Arcadius</a>. She wrote a commentary on <a href=/people/1288 target=_blank>Diophantos</a>, the Astronomical Canon, and a commentary on the Conics of <a href=/people/10783 target=_blank>Apollonios</a>. She was torn to pieces by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, and her body was violated and scattered over the whole city. She suffered this because of envy and her exceptional wisdom, especially in regard to astronomy. According to some, [this was the fault of] <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, but according to others, [it resulted] from the inveterate insolence and rebelliousness of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>. For they did this also to many of their own bishops: consider <a href=/people/4538 target=_blank>George</a> and Proterios. <br />Concerning <a href=/people/3858 target=_blank>Hypatia</a> the philosopher, proof that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> [were] rebellious. She was born and raised and educated in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. Having a nobler nature than her father's, she was not satisfied with his mathematical instruction, but she also embraced the rest of philosophy with diligence. Putting on the philosopher's cloak although a woman and advancing through the middle of the city, she explained publicly to those who wished to hear either <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> or <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> or any other of the philosophers. In addition to her teaching, attaining the height of practical virtue, becoming just and prudent, she remained a virgin. She was so very beautiful and attractive that one of those who attended her lectures fell in love with her. He was not able to contain his desire, but he informed her of his condition. Ignorant reports say that <a href=/people/3858 target=_blank>Hypatia</a> relieved him of his disease by music; but truth proclaims that music failed to have any effect. She brought some of her female rags and threw them before him, showing him the signs of her unclean origin, and said, You love this, o youth, and there is nothing beautiful about it. His soul was turned away by shame and surprise at the unpleasant sight, and he was brought to his right mind. Such was <a href=/people/3858 target=_blank>Hypatia</a>, both skillful and eloquent in words and prudent and civil in deeds. The rest of the city loved and honored her exceptionally, and those who were appointed at each time as rulers of the city at first attended her lectures, as also it used to happen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. For if the reality had perished, yet the name of philosophy still seemed magnificent and admirable to those who held the highest offices in the community. So then once it happened that <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> who was bishop of the opposing faction, passing by the house of <a href=/people/3858 target=_blank>Hypatia</a>, saw that there was a great pushing and shoving against the doors, of men and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> together, some approaching, some departing, and some standing by. When he asked what crowd this was and what the tumult at the house was, he heard from those who followed that the philosopher <a href=/people/3858 target=_blank>Hypatia</a> was now speaking and that it was her house. When he learned this, his soul was bitten with envy, so that he immediately plotted her death, a most unholy of all deaths. For as she came out as usual many close-packed ferocious men, truly despicable, fearing neither the eye of the gods nor the vengeance of men, killed the philosopher, inflicting this very great pollution and shame on their homeland. And the emperor would have been angry at this, if <a href=/people/7167 target=_blank>Aidesios</a> had not been bribed. He remitted the penalty for the murders, but drew this on himself and his family, and his offspring paid the price. <br />The memory of these [events] still preserved among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> considerably reduced the honor and zeal of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> for <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a>: and although such a threat was impending, nevertheless each strove to keep company with him frequently and to hear the words which came from his wise mouth. As many as excelled in rhetorical or poetic pursuits also welcomed regular association with the philosopher. For even if he was ill-trained in such matters, yet through his philosophical acumen he contributed to these men some greater diligence in their own skills. For he discussed everything with precision and he criticized more judiciously than others the speeches and poems presented. Therefore also in the performance of some literary show he praised sparingly what was presented. His praise was very modest, nevertheless timely and appropriate. Hence all the audience, so to speak, used his judgment as a guide for who spoke better or worse. I know three critics of my time who are able to judge what is said [both with] and without meter. The same man's judgment is recognized for both poems and prose compositions. But I judge the same man to be a creator of both only if equal practice is devoted to both and equal eagerness. I do not say that <a href=/people/1510 target=_blank>Isidore</a> was one of these, but was even far inferior to the three.

After <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>' death, <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> was reluctant to kill <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, who had been slandered by <a href=/people/163 target=_blank>Tissaphernes</a>, and released him when his mother <a href=/people/898 target=_blank>Parysatis</a> interceded for him and preserved his army for him. To make war on <a href=/people/163 target=_blank>Tissaphernes</a>, he assembled a force and determined to campaign against his brother. 400 left <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, and among the members of the expedition 3500 hoplites and dependents fled. <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> went up with them.

The Greeks were assembled by <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> and chose <a href=/people/1238 target=_blank>Ariaeus</a> as their king, but he declined. The King then chopped off <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>' head and hand and sent them to the Greeks, requesting their weapons as if they had been vanquished, but they did not hand them over. Deceitfully <a href=/people/163 target=_blank>Tissaphernes</a> violates his oaths and betrays to the King the Greeks <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> and <a href=/people/2426 target=_blank>Meno</a>, whom he kills.

[It means] ford of a river, a bridge. <br />The most gentle currents of rivers are yoked by Romans, since this too always served as an exercise for the soldiers just like any other element of military science that was practiced, [and they did this] on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Istros</a> [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a> ], Rhenos [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a>] and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>. The method — since not everybody knows about it — is as follows: wide are the ships with which the river is yoked; they are anchored a little bit upstream, above the place where the yoking will take place. After the sign is given they send forth the first ship so it is borne downstream close to their own bank. As soon as it has reached the place for the yoking, they throw into the stream a basket full of stones tied with cord like an anchor. After the ship is moored and positioned by the bank, immediately planks and ties, of which the ship carries an abundant supply, are laid out toward the point of disembarcation. Then they send forth another ship little bit further from that one and the next one further than the second until they extend the yoke to the opposite bank. A ship as outfitted for war also carries turrets and a gate and archers and catapults. Since plenty of arrows were being shot against the people that were doing the yoking, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> orders them to fire arrows and catapults. When the first attackers fell for the barbarians others followed. <br />Yoking a mule-team or <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-team, what is called a κλινίς, which is similar to a double seat, completes the entourage of the bride. After taking her from her father's home they lead her on the cart to the house of the one who is marrying her when the evening is well advanced. Three of them sit on the cart, the bride in the middle and on either side the groom and the best man. He is the [groom's] most esteemed and beloved friend or relative. Since the cart used to be called an ὄχημα ['vehicle'], the one riding alongside [παροχούμενος ] in the third place was called the πάροχος ['best man']. From this custom even if people to go fetch the girl on foot the third in attendance is called a πάροχος . (Tr: KIRIL GALEV) </p>                        </div>

[It was he] who, wanting to leave his son <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a> as successor, advanced him at quite an early age through the offices and bid him exercise his body in order to add to his youthful vigor. And the imperial officers, as they were in authority over the spending of public funds, seduced him into drinking luxuriantly; and, encouraging him in his vices, they taught him, contrary to custom, to madly desire his fellow youths in accord with the loves of males. And so, when he became accustomed to the good of a life situated amidst delusional pleasure, he displayed on his face the arrogance that burned from within him because he expected to inherit the imperial title, and he began to walk proudly, to lift his neck up high, and — to speak shortly — to be imperious to everyone as if to slaves. But the overseer of all, having seen his inborn and his educated baseness, deemed it best that, after having a stomach ailment and diarrhoea and relieving himself in bed in his unconciousness, he depart then prematurely from human things. <br />[It is said that] the emperor <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zeno</a>, when he discovered the defeat of his forces, fled into a fort situated on a hill, which the inhabitants call Constantinopole. Realizing this, he groaned to those with him, God's joke, he said, yes, that's what man is, if truly the divine loves thus to mock even me, for the prophets maintained their prophecy for me that in the month of July I must be in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. And I thought that I would come back into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>. But now, a fugitive bereft of everything, I have come onto a hill, discovering — wretch that I am — that it has the same name [as the city]. (Tr: ABRAM RING) </p>                        </div>
