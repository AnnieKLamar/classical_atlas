Moreover, <a href=/people/2345 target=_blank>Plato</a> sees that a good commander or general can do nothing unless his army is amenable and loyal; and he thinks that the quality of obedience, like the quality characteristic of a king, requires a noble nature and a philosophic training, which, above all things, blends harmoniously the qualities of gentleness and humanity with those of high courage and aggressiveness. Many dire events, and particularly those which befell the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> after the death of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, bear witness to this, and show plainly that an empire has nothing more fearful to show than a military force given over to untrained and unreasoning impulses. </p>                        </div>
