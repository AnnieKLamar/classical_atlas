Of the forty-nine kings who successively ruled the country before the Romans, it does not concern me to make special mention in writing Roman history. <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a>, surnamed the Hunter, was the one to whom <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, gave his sister in marriage.

When <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a> was taken prisoner <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> went to meet the Roman generals, clad in a toga which they call the tebennus, shod in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> fashion, with his head shaved and wearing on it a pilleus in the manner of slaves who have been made free in their masters' wills, and making himself appear base and insignificant in other ways. When he met them he said in the Latin tongue, I am the freedman of the Romans, which is to say 'emancipated.' They laughed at him and sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

As he was slow in obeying, the ambassadors laid stern commands upon him to obey the orders of the Senate and to go with 1000 <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to the boundary line to negotiate a treaty with <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, who, they said, was awaiting him there with an equal number. Despising the handful of men with <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> and hoping to ensnare him, <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> sent the ambassadors in advance to say that he was following with 1000 men, but actually put his whole army in motion and advanced as if to battle. When <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> and the ambassadors learned of this they took to promiscuous flight. <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> seized the beasts of burden belonging to the Romans that had been left behind, captured and destroyed the stronghold of <a href=/people/9887 target=_blank>Nicephorium</a>, burned the temples in it, and besieged <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, who had fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamus</a>.

A small number of soldiers had overcome a much larger one, not by having a better position, or through any blunder of the enemy, but by the valor of the generals and the fighting quality of the army. <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a> now encamped alongside of <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a>. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> ascended Mount Scoroba, which lies on the boundary between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>.

When the consuls cast lots, the government of Asia and the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> war fell to <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Cornelius Sulla</a>.

The diggers met each other underground, and fought there with swords and spears as well as they could in the darkness. While this was going on, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> pounded the wall with rams erected on the tops of mounds until part of it fell down. Then he hastened to burn the neighboring tower, and discharged a large number of fire-bearing missiles against it, and ordered his bravest soldiers to mount the ladders. Both sides fought bravely, but the tower was burned. Another small part of the wall was thrown down also, over against which <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> at once stationed a guard. Having now undermined a section of the wall, so that it was only sustained by wooden beams, he placed a great quantity of sulphur, hemp, and pitch under it, and set fire to the whole at once. The walls fell — now here, now there — carrying the defenders down with them.

When he saw the enemy encamped in a rocky region near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>, where there was no chance of escape for the vanquished, he took possession of a broad plain near by and drew up his forces in such a way that he could compel <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> to fight whether he wanted to or not, and where the slope of the plain favored the Romans either in advancing or retreating. <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> was hedged in by rocks which, in a battle, would not allow his whole army to act in concert, as he could not bring them together by reason of the unevenness of the ground; and if they were routed their flight would be impeded by the rocks. Relying for these reasons on his advantage of position <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> moved forward in such a way that the enemy's superiority of numbers should not be of any service to him. <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> did not dream of coming to an engagement at that time, for which reason he had been careless in choosing the place for his camp. Now that the Romans were advancing he perceived sorrowfully and too late the badness of his position, and he sent forward a detachment of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to prevent the movement. The detachment was put to flight and shattered among the rocks. He next charged with sixty chariots, hoping to sever and break in pieces the formation of the legions by the shock. The Romans opened their ranks and the chariots were carried through by their own momentum to the rear, and before they could turn back they were surrounded and destroyed by the javelins of the rear guard. </p>                        </div>

He first made a powerful charge with his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, cut the Roman formation in two, and, by reason of the smallness of their numbers, completely surrounded both parts.

Others with more wisdom fled toward their own camp. <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> placed himself in front of them and barred the entrance, and ordered them to turn and face the enemy, thus betraying the greatest inexperience of the exigencies of war. They obeyed him with alacrity, but as they no longer had either generals to lead, or officers to align them, or standards to show where they belonged, but were scattered in disorderly rout, and had no room either to fly or to fight, the pursuit having brought them into their very narrowest place, they were killed without resistance, some by the enemy, upon whom they could not retaliate, and others by their own friends in the jam and confusion. Again they fled toward the gates of the camp, around which they became congested. They up braided the gate-keepers. They appealed to them in the name of their country's gods and their common relationship, and reproached them that they were slaughtered not so much by the swords of the enemy as by the indifference of their friends.

For a third move, his general, <a href=/people/3993 target=_blank>Zenobius</a>, who was conducting an army to Greece, seized the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> and all the fortified places by night, stationed guards at the gates, and made proclamation that all strangers should remain quiet, and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> should repair to the assembly so that he might give them a message from the king.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=ethnic long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chians</a> wanted to send legates to the king, but <a href=/people/3993 target=_blank>Zenobius</a> would not allow it.

He did this hoping (as indeed it turned out) that the debtors, sojourners, and slaves would consider their new privileges secure only under the rule of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, and would therefore be well disposed toward him. In the meantime Mynnio and <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=person long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Cleisthenes</a> and <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=person long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>, all of them the king's intimates (<a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodotus</a> had once entertained him as a guest) joined in a conspiracy against <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>. Of this conspiracy <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodotus</a> himself became the informer, and in order to confirm his story he arranged that the king should conceal himself under a couch and hear what Mynnio said. The plot being thus revealed the conspirators were put to death with torture, and many others suffered from suspicion of similar designs. Thus eighty citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamus</a> were caught taking counsel together to like purpose, and others in other cities. The king sent spies everywhere who denounced their own enemies, and in this way about 1500 men lost their lives. Some of these accusers were captured by <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> a little later and put to death, others committed suicide, and still others took refuge with <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. </p>                        </div>

But if he is playing the hypocrite again, I advise you, <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, to look out for yourself. Consider how matters stand at present between you and him. Bear in mind how he has treated his other friends and how we treated <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> and <a href=/people/305 target=_blank>Masinissa</a>. While he was yet speaking, <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> rejected the offer with indignation, saying that he would never betray one who had put an army under his command. I hope, he said, to come to an agreement with you if you offer moderate terms. After a short interval <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> said, If <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> will deliver to us the entire fleet in your possession; if he will surrender our generals and ambassadors and all prisoners, deserters, and runaway slaves, and send back to their homes the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> and all others whom he has dragged off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>; if he will remove his garrison from all places except those that he held before the outbreak of hostilities; if he will pay the cost of the war incurred on his account, and remain content with his ancestral dominions, — I shall hope to persuade the Romans not to remember the injuries he has done them. Such were the terms which he offered. <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> at once withdrew his garrison from all the places he held and referred the other conditions to the king. In order to make use of his leisure in the meantime, <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> marched against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/457120REne class=ethnic long=12.01 lat=45.7>Eneti</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420313RDar class=ethnic long=21.32 lat=42.03>Dardani</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414233RSin class=ethnic long=23.3 lat=41.4>Sinti</a>, tribes on the border of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, who were continually invading that country, and devastated their territory.

And all this, he said, they did for money, taking it from me and from them by turns; for there is nothing of which most of you are so liable to accusation, O Romans, as the love of lucre.

But although you took swift vengeance on <a href=/people/349 target=_blank>Nicomedes</a>, why did you attack <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, who had not harmed you? When you drove him out of his kingdom you imposed upon the Romans, who were there, the necessity of putting him back. By preventing them from doing so you brought on the war. You had meditated war a long time, because you hoped to rule the whole world if you could conquer the Romans, and the reasons you tell of were mere pretexts to cover your real intent.

You brought the tetrarchs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=place long=33 lat=40.1>Galatia</a> together at a banquet and slew them.

You overran our province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and deprived the Greeks of their freedom.

The proof of this is that when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a> complained of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a> we deprived them of their authority. Such was our conduct toward you. You, on the other hand, when <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> <a href=/people/3935 target=_blank>Philometor</a> had left his kingdom to us in his will, gave aid to <a href=/people/916 target=_blank>Aristonicus</a> against us for four years. When he was captured most of you, under the impulse of necessity and fear, returned to your duty. Notwithstanding all this, after a period of twenty-four years, during which you had attained to great prosperity and embellishment, public and private, you again became puffed up by ease and luxury and took the opportunity, while we were preoccupied in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, some of you to call in <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> and others to join him when he came.

You did not even spare those who fled to the temples dedicated to your own gods. You have received some punishment for this crime from <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself, who broke faith with you and gave you your fill of rapine and slaughter, redistributed your lands, cancelled debts, freed your slaves, appointed tyrants over some of you, and committed robberies everywhere by land and sea; so that you learned immediately by experiment and comparison what kind of defender you chose instead of your former ones. The instigators of these crimes paid some penalty to us also. It is necessary, too, that some penalty should be inflicted upon you in common, as you have been guilty in common, and something corresponding to your deserts. But may the Romans never even conceive of impious slaughter, indiscriminate confiscation, servile insurrections, or other acts of barbarism. I shall spare even now the Greek race and name so celebrated throughout Asia, and for the sake of that fair repute that is ever dear to the Romans I shall only impose upon you the taxes of five years, to be paid at once, together with the cost of the war expended by me, and whatever else may be spent in settling the affairs of the province. I will apportion these charges to each of you according to cities, and will fix the time of payment. Upon the disobedient I shall visit punishment as upon enemies. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a> asked him to give them his son, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, as their ruler, and when he did so they at once returned to their allegiance.

Against the tribes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=place long=36.66 lat=45.36>Bosporus</a> he built a fleet and fitted out a large army.

With their assistance <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> began his third and last war against the Romans, in the course of which he lost his entire kingdom, and <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> lost his life in Spain.

When he learned from deserters that the king's army contained about 300,000 men and that all his supplies were furnished by foragers or came by sea, he said to those around him that he would presently reduce the enemy without fighting, and he told them to remember his promise. Seeing a mountain well suited for a camp, where he could readily obtain supplies, and could cut off those of the enemy, he moved forward to occupy it in order to gain a victory by that means without danger. There was only one narrow pass leading to it, and <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> held it by a strong guard. He had been advised to do so by <a href=/people/1357 target=_blank>Taxiles</a> and his other officers.

What is the use of a battle and bloodshed when you can conquer the enemy without fighting? <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> assented to this advice heedlessly and without suspicion. He allowed the Romans to go through the pass unmolested and to fortify the great hill on his front. When they had possessed themselves of it they were able to draw supplies from their rear without difficulty. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, on the other hand, was cut off by a lake, by mountains, and by rivers, from all provisions on the landward side, except an occasional supply secured with difficulty; he had no easy way out and he could not overcome <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> on account of the difficulty of the ground, which he had disregarded when he himself had the advantage. Moreover, winter was now approaching and would soon interrupt his supplies by sea. As <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> looked over the situation he reminded his friends of his promise, and showed them that his prediction was practically accomplished. </p>                        </div>

The barbarians wanted to put him to death, but the king said that he would not do violence to bravery overtaken by misfortune. He drew out his forces for battle several days in succession, but <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> would not come down and fight; so he looked about for some way to come at him by ascending the mountain.

Those who overtook <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself cut open the pack saddle of a mule that was loaded with gold, which fell out, and while they were busy with it they allowed him to escape to Comona. From thence he fled to <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a> with 2000 horsemen. <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a> did not admit him to his presence, but ordered that royal entertainment be provided for him on his estates. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, in utter despair of his kingdom, sent the eunuch <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> to his palace to put his sisters, wives, and concubines to death as he could. These, with wonderful devotion, destroyed themselves with daggers, poison, and ropes. When the garrison commanders of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> saw these things they went over to <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> in crowds, all but a few. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> marched among the others and regulated them.

Then he sent his own infantry around to the hill and took possession of it unobserved. When he saw the enemy pursuing as though they had won the fight, and scattered in all directions, with their entire baggage-train lying at the foot of the hill, he exclaimed, Soldiers, we are victorious, and dashed first upon their baggage-carriers. These immediately fled in confusion and ran against their own infantry, and the infantry against the cavalry. Presently the rout was complete. Those who had been drawn a long distance in pursuit of the Roman <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, the latter turned upon and destroyed.

There was a great slaughter. Nobody stopped to plunder, for <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> had forbidden it with threats of punishment, so that they passed by bracelets and necklaces on the road, and continued killing for a distance of 120 stades until nightfall.

At this juncture a certain Roman of senatorial rank, named <a href=/people/8921 target=_blank>Attidius</a>, a fugitive from justice, who had been with <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> a long time and had enjoyed his friendship, was detected in a conspiracy against him. The king condemned him to death, but not to torture, because he had once been a Roman senator. His fellow-conspirators were subjected to dreadful tortures. The freedmen who were cognizant of the designs of <a href=/people/8921 target=_blank>Attidius</a> he dismissed unharmed, because they were under obligations to their patron.

In the beginning they prowled around with a few small boats worrying the inhabitants like robbers. As the war lengthened they became more numerous and navigated larger ships. Relishing their large gains, they did not desist when <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> was defeated, made peace, and retired. Having lost both livelihood and country by reason of the war and fallen into extreme destitution, they harvested the sea instead of the land, at first with pinnaces and hemiolii, then with two-bank and three-bank ships, sailing in squadrons under <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a> chiefs, who were like generals of an army. They fell upon unfortified towns. (B.C. 85) They undermined or battered down the walls of others, or captured them by regular siege and plundered them. They carried off the wealthier citizens to their haven of refuge and held them for ransom. They scorned the name of robbers and called their takings the prize of warfare. They had artisans chained to their tasks and were continually bringing in materials of timber, brass, and iron. Being elated by their gains and determined not to change their mode of life yet, they likened themselves to kings, rulers, and great armies, and thought that if they should all come together in the same place they would be invincible. They built ships and made all kinds of arms. Their chief seat was at a place called the Crags in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, which they had chosen as their common anchorage and encampment. They had castles and towers and desert islands and retreats everywhere. They chose for their principal rendezvous the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> where it was rough and harborless and rose in high mountain peaks, for which reason they were all called by the common name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a>.

His fellow-conspirators were captured and put to the torture, but <a href=/people/3426 target=_blank>Menophanes</a> persuaded the king that it would not be seemly, just as he was starting on his expedition, to put to death the son who had been until then the dearest to him. People were liable to such turns, he said, in time of war, and when they came to an end things quieted down again. In this way <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> was persuaded to pardon his son, but the latter, still fearing his father's anger, and knowing that the army shrank from the expedition, went by night to the leading Roman deserters who were encamped very near the king, and by representing to them in its true light, and as they well knew it, the danger of their advancing against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and by making them many promises if they would refuse to go, induced them to desert from his father. After <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a> had persuaded them he sent emissaries the same night to other camps near by and won them over. Early in the morning the first deserters raised a shout, and those next to them repeated it, and so on. Even the naval force joined in the cry, not all of them having been advised beforehand perhaps, but eager for a change, despising failure, and always ready to attach themselves to a new hope. Others, who were ignorant of the conspiracy, thought that all had been corrupted, and that if they remained alone they would be scorned by the majority, and so from fear and necessity rather than inclination joined in the shouting. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, being awakened by the noise, sent messengers out to inquire what the shouters wanted. The latter made no concealment, but said, We want your son to be king; we want a young man instead of an old one who is ruled by eunuchs, the slayer of so many of his sons, his generals, and his friends. </p>                        </div>

A part of his own guard then ran to join the deserters, but the latter refused to admit them unless they would do some irreparable deed as a proof of their fidelity, pointing at the same time to <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>. So they hastened to kill his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, for he himself had fled, and at the same time saluted <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a> as king, as though the rebels were already victorious, and one of them brought a broad papyrus leaf from a temple and crowned him with it in place of a diadem. The king saw these things from a high portico, and he sent messenger after messenger to <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a> asking permission to fly in safety. When none of his messengers returned, fearing lest he should be delivered up to the Romans, he praised the body-guards and friends who had been faithful to him and sent them to the new king, but the army killed some of them under a misapprehension as they were approaching. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> then took out some poison that he always carried next to his sword, and mixed it. There two of his daughters, who were still girls growing up together, named Mithridatis and Nyssa, who had been betrothed to the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, asked him to let them have some of the poison first, and insisted strenuously and prevented him from drinking it until they had taken some and swallowed it. The drug took effect on them at once; but upon <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, although he walked around rapidly to hasten its action, it had no effect, because he had accustomed himself to other drugs by continually trying them as a means of protection against poisoners. These are still called the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> drugs. Seeing a certain <a href=/people/7383 target=_blank>Bituitus</a> there, an officer of the Gauls, he said to him, I have profited much from your right arm against my enemies. I shall profit from it most of all if you will kill me, and save from the danger of being led in a Roman triumph one who has been an autocrat so many years, and the ruler of so great a kingdom, but who is now unable to die by poison because, like a fool, he has fortified himself against the poison of others. Although I have kept watch and ward against all the poisons that one takes with his food, I have not provided against that domestic poison, always the most dangerous to kings, the treachery of army, children, and friends. <a href=/people/7383 target=_blank>Bituitus</a>, thus appealed to, rendered the king the service that he desired. </p>                        </div>

He made alliances with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=ethnic long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnites</a> and the Gauls, and he sent legates to <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> in Spain. He was often wounded by enemies and by conspirators, but he never desisted from anything on that account, even when he was an old man. None of the conspiracies ever escaped his detection, not even the last one, but he voluntarily overlooked it and perished in consequence of it — so ungrateful is the wickedness that has been once pardoned. He was bloodthirsty and cruel to all — the slayer of his mother, his brother, three sons, and three daughters.

He used to drive a chariot with sixteen <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> at once.

But the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=place long=36.66 lat=45.36>Bosporus</a> now had rulers of their own and a praetor was sent by the Senate yearly to govern <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>. Although <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was offended with the other rulers who held their possessions as gifts from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, since they had aided <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> against him, nevertheless he confirmed their titles, except the priesthood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404366UCom class=place long=36.6387 lat=40.3575>Comana</a> which he took from <a href=/people/12355 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> and gave to <a href=/people/1223 target=_blank>Lycomedes</a>. Not long after, all these countries, and those which Gaius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> or Mark <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had given to others, were made Roman provinces by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus Caesar</a>, after he had taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, as the Romans needed only the slightest pretext in each case. Thus, since their dominion had been advanced in consequence of the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> war, from Spain and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars of Hercules</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> sea, and the sands which border <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, it was fitting that this victory should be called the great one, and that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, who commanded the army, should be styled the Great. As they held Africa also as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> (for <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a>, the king of that country, a bastard of the house of the <a href=/people/7852 target=_blank>Lagidae</a>, left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> itself to the Romans in his will), <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> alone was lacking to their grasp of the whole Mediterranean. </p>                        </div>
