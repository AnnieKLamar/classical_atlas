When he was at the point of death he adopted a daughter, stipulating in his will that, if anything should happen to her, the estate should pass to <a href=/people/1348 target=_blank>Glaucon</a>, who was his half-brother, his mother's son. After making these arrangements he died; and the daughter received the inheritance and then herself died. <a href=/people/579 target=_blank>Eubulides</a> having also died, his daughter brought an action against <a href=/people/1348 target=_blank>Glaucon</a> and was awarded the estate. After this, <a href=/people/1253 target=_blank>Stratocles</a> and <a href=/people/1384 target=_blank>Stratius</a> having died, <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, acting alone, brought a suit against her and was awarded the estate. It is against him that the son of his brother <a href=/people/1253 target=_blank>Stratocles</a> brings an action through a guardian, alleged that the inheritance belongs in equal shares to <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> and to his brother's son. The discussion turns on a point of fact. [Laws] <br />I have read you the laws because my opponent bases on the first of them the claim of the child to half the estate — a claim which is false. <a href=/people/317 target=_blank>Hagnias</a>, it is true, was not our brother; but in the matter of a brother's property the law has given the right of inheritance first to brothers and nephews provided they are on the father's side; for they are related to the deceased in the nearest degree.</p>                        </div>

If these fail, it gives the right of succession as next-of-kin to the third degree, namely, first cousins on the father's side including their children. If this degree is also lacking, the law goes back and gives the succession to the relatives of the deceased on his mother's side on the same principles as originally regulated the rights of inheritance by the relatives on the father's side.</p>                        </div>

This child does not possess a single one of these titles as next-of-kin to <a href=/people/317 target=_blank>Hagnias</a>, but is outside all relationship. In order that you may know exactly upon what points you are going to give your verdict, I challenge my opponent to state, without superfluous words, in which of the above-mentioned degrees of relationship this child stands to the former tenant of the estate. If he can be shown to be in any way related, I willingly concede that half the estate is his.</p>                        </div>

You will thus learn whether, or no, the child has any right to the fortune of <a href=/people/317 target=_blank>Hagnias</a>.
