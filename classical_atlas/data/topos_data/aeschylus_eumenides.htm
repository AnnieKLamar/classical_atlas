I am running on hands and knees, with no quickness in my limbs; for an old woman, overcome with fright, is nothing, or rather she is like a child. <br />I was on my way to the inner shrine, decked with wreaths; I saw on the center-stone a man defiled in the eyes of the gods, occupying the seat of suppliants. His hands were dripping blood; he held a sword just drawn and an olive-branch, from the top of the tree, decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool, a shining fleece; for as to this I can speak clearly. </p>                        </div>

After you name your country and family and fortunes, then defend yourself against this charge; if indeed, relying on the justice of your case, you sit clinging to my image near my hearth, as a sacred suppliant, like <a href=/people/729 target=_blank>Ixion</a>. To all this give me a plain answer. <br />ORESTES: Lady <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, first of all I will take away a great anxiety from your last words. I am not a suppliant in need of purification, nor did I sit at your image with pollution on my hands. I will give you strong proof of this. It is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a new-born victim by a man who can purify from murder. Long before at other houses I have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams. <br />And so I declare that this concern is out of the way. As to my family, you will soon learn. I am an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a>; my father — you rightly inquire about him — was <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, the commander of the naval forces; along with him, you made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>, to be no city. He did not die nobly, after he came home; but my black-hearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath. And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a> is responsible for this deed, because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content. </p>                        </div>

It is profitable to learn wisdom under strain.

For who among mortals, if he fears nothing, is righteous?

My word has been spoken.

But <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> of the assembly has prevailed. Our rivalry in doing good is victorious forever. <br />CHORUS: I pray that discord, greedy for evil, may never clamor in this city, and may the dust not drink the black blood of its people and through passion cause ruinous murder for vengeance to the destruction of the state. But may they return joy for joy in a spirit of common love, and may they hate with one mind; for this is the cure of many an evil in the world. <br />ATHENA: Do they not then intend to find the path of good speech? From these terrible faces I see great profit for these citizens; for, if you always greatly honor with kindness the kindly ones, you will surely be pre-eminent, keeping your land and city in the straight path of justice. <br />CHORUS: Farewell, farewell, in the wealth allotted to you by fate. Farewell, people of the city, seated near to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the beloved of the beloved maiden, learning at last the way of wisdom.

You who hold the city, children of <a href=/people/4340 target=_blank>Cranaus</a>, lead on their way these new dwellers here. May there be good will in the citizens in return for good done to them! <br />CHORUS: Farewell, farewell, again, I repeat, all you in the city, both gods and mortals, living in <a href=/people/429 target=_blank>Pallas</a>' city; if you duly revere my residence among you, you will not blame the chances of life. <br />ATHENA: I approve the words of your invocation, and will escort you by the light of gleaming torches to the places below and beneath the earth, with the attendant women who guard my image in duty bound. For the eye of the whole land of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> will come forth, a glorious troop of children, matrons and a band of old women.
