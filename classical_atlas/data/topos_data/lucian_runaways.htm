When formerly you looked down upon the world, and saw that it was filled with iniquity and transgression, and was become the troubled abode of sin and folly, you had compassion on the frailty of ignorant mankind, and sent me down to them: you bade me see to it, that wickedness and violence and brutality should cease from among them; I was to lift their eyes upwards to the truth, and cause them to live together in unity.

First, then, I went to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, the mightiest nation upon earth.
