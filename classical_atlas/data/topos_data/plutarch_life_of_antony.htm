He had not much property himself, and therefore was prevented by his wife from indulging his kindly feelings. When, accordingly, one of his intimates came to him with a request for money, money he had not, but he ordered a young slave to put water into a silver bowl and bring it to him, and when it was brought, he moistened his chin, as though about to shave. The slave was then sent away on another errand improvised for the occasion, whereupon <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> gave the bowl to his friend and bade him dispose of it. Later, when a careful search for it was made for it among the slaves, seeing that his wife was angry and proposed to put them to the torture one by one, <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> confessed what he had done, and by his entreaties gained her pardon. </p>                        </div>

By this mother her son <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was reared, after the death of whose father she married <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, whom <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> put to death for joining the conspiracy of <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>. This would seem to have been the origin and ground of the violent hatred which <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> felt towards <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. At any rate, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> says that not even the dead body of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> was given up to them until his mother had begged it from the wife of <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. This, however, is admittedly false; for no one of those who were punished at that time by <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> was deprived of burial. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> gave brilliant promise in his youth, they say, until his intimate friendship with <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> fell upon him like a pest. For <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> himself was unrestrained in his pleasures, and in order to make <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> more manageable, engaged him in drinking bouts, and with women, and in immoderate and extravagant expenditures. This involved <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> in a heavy debt and one that was excessive for his years — a debt of two hundred and fifty talents. For this whole sum <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> went surety, but his father heard of it and banished <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> from his house. Then <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> allied himself for a short time with <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, the most audacious and low-lived demagogue of his time, in the violent courses which were convulsing the state; but he soon became sated with that miscreant's madness, and fearing the party which was forming against him, left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for Greece, where he spent some time in military exercises and the study of oratory. He adopted what was called the Asiatic style of oratory, which was at the height of its popularity in those days and bore a strong resemblance to his own life, which was swashbuckling and boastful, full of empty exultation and distorted ambition. </p>                        </div>

And first, having been sent against <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, who was bringing the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to a revolt, he was himself the first man to mount the highest of the fortifications, and drove <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> from all of them; then he joined battle with him, routed his many times more numerous forces with his own small band, and slew all but a few of them. <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> himself was captured, together with his son. After this, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> tried to persuade <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> by a bribe of ten thousand talents to join him in an invasion of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and recover the kingdom for him. But the greater part of the officers were opposed to the plan, and <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> himself felt a certain dread of the war, although he was completely captivated by the ten thousand talents. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, however, who was ambitious of great exploits and eager to gratify the request of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, joined the king in persuading and inciting <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> to the expedition. But more than the war the march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a> was feared, since their route lay through deep sand, where there was no water, as far as the <a href=/people/5626 target=_blank>Ecregma</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312332WSer class=place long=33.432 lat=31.105>Serbonian</a> marshes. These the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> call the blasts of <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, although they appear to be a residual arm of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, helped by infiltration, where the isthmus between them and the Mediterranean is at its narrowest. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was therefore sent with the cavalry, and he not only occupied the narrow pass, but actually took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, a large city, and got its garrison into his power, thus rendering its march safer for the main army and giving its general assured hope of victory. And even the enemy reaped advantage from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s love of distinction. For <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, as soon as he entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, was led by wrath and hatred to institute a massacre of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>; but <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> intervened and prevented him. Moreover, in the ensuing battles and contests, which were many and great, he displayed many deeds of daring and sagacious leadership, the most conspicuous of which was his rendering the van of the army victorious by outflanking the enemy and enveloping them from the rear. For all this he received rewards of valour and fitting honours. Nor did the multitude fail to observe his humane treatment of the dead <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, for after waging war upon him by necessity while he was living, although he had been a comrade and friend, when he had fallen, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> found his body and gave it royal adornment and burial. Thus he left among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> a very high reputation, and was thought by the Romans on the expedition to be a most illustrious man. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, there was an ancient tradition that the <a href=/people/3137 target=_blank>Antonii</a> were <a href=/people/324 target=_blank>Heracleidae</a>, being descendants of <a href=/people/8837 target=_blank>Anton</a>, a son of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. And this tradition <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> thought that he confirmed, both by the shape of his body, as has been said, and by his attire. For whenever he was going to be seen by many people, he always wore his tunic girt up to his thigh, a large sword hung at his side, and a heavy cloak enveloped him. However, even what others thought offensive, namely, his jesting and boastfulness, his drinking-horn in evidence, his sitting by a comrade who was eating, or his standing to eat at a soldier's table, — it is astonishing how much goodwill and affection for him all this produced in his soldiers. And somehow even his conduct in the field of love was not without its charm, nay, it actually won for him the favour of many; for he assisted them in their love affairs, and submitted pleasantly to their jests upon his own amours. Furthermore, his liberality, and his bestowal of favours upon friends and soldiers with no scant or sparing hand, laid a splendid foundation for his growing strength, and when he had become great, lifted his power to yet greater heights, although it was hindered by countless faults besides. One illustration of his lavish giving I will relate. To one of his friends he ordered that two hundred and fifty thousand drachmas should be given (a sum which the Romans call decies). His steward was amazed, and in order to show <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> the magnitude of the sum, deposited the money in full view. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, passing by, asked what that was; and when his steward told him it was the gift which he had ordered, he divined the man's malice and said: I thought the decies was more; this is a trifle; therefore add as much more to it. </p>                        </div>

But when matters at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> came to a crisis, the aristocratic party attaching itself to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, who was in the city, and the popular party summoning <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from Gaul, where he was in arms, then <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, the friend of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, who had changed sides and was now favouring the cause of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, brought <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> over to it. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> had great influence with the multitude from his eloquence, and made lavish use of money supplied by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and so got <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> elected tribune of the people, and afterwards one of the priests, called augurs, who observe the flight of birds. As soon as <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> entered upon his office he was of great assistance to those who were managing affairs in the interests of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. In the first place, when <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> the consul proposed to put under <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s control the soldiers already collected, and to give him power to levy others, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> opposed him by introducing a decree that the forces already assembled should sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and give aid to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, who was carrying on war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, and that the troops which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was then levying should not belong to him. In the second place, when the senate would not receive <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letters nor allow them to be read, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, whose office gave him power, read them himself, and thereby changed the opinion of many, who judged from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letters that he was making only reasonable and just demands. And finally, when two questions were before the senate, one, whether <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should dismiss his forces, and the other, whether <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should do so, and only a few were for having <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> lay down his arms, and all but a few were for having <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> do so, then <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> rose and asked whether it was the opinion of the senate that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> alike should lay down their arms and dismiss their forces. This proposal all accepted with alacrity, and with shouts of praise for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> they demanded that the question be put to a vote. But the consuls would not consent to this, and again the friends of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> put forward fresh demands which were thought to be reasonable. These <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> opposed, and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, in his capacity of consul, drove <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> from the senate. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> went forth heaping many imprecations upon them, and putting on the dress of a slave, and hiring a car in company with Quintus <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, he set out to join <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. As soon as they came into <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s presence they cried loudly that everything was now at loose ends in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, since even tribunes of the people had no freedom of speech, but everyone who raised his voice in behalf of justice was persecuted and ran risk of his life. </p>                        </div>

Therefore <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, in his Philippics, wrote that as <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> was the cause of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war, so <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was the cause of the civil war. But this was manifestly false. For Caius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was not a pliable man, nor easily led by anger to act on impulse. Therefore, had he not long ago determined upon his course, he would not thus, on the spur of the moment, have made war upon his country, just because he saw that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, meanly clad, with <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, on a hired car, had come in flight to him; nay, this merely afforded a cloak and a specious reason for war to a man who had long wanted a pretext for it. And that which led him to war against all mankind, as it had led <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> before him, and <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> of old, was an insatiable love of power and a mad desire to be first and greatest; this he could not achieve if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> were not put down. And so he came up against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and got it into his power, and drove <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; and determining first to turn his efforts against the forces of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> which were in Spain, and afterwards, when he had got ready a fleet, to cross the sea against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself, he entrusted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, who was praetor, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the troops to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, who was tribune of the people. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> at once gained the favour of the soldiers by sharing their exercises, living with them for the most part, and making them presents as generously as he could; but to everybody else he was odious. For his easy disposition led him to neglect the wronged, he listened angrily to those who consulted him, and he was in ill repute for his relations with other men's wives. In a word, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s power, which proved to be anything rather than a tyranny so far as his own course was concerned, was brought into odium by his friends; and of these <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, who had the greatest power and was thought to be the greatest transgressor, incurred the most blame. </p>                        </div>

Being discovered by the enemy and pursued, he escaped the danger from them, since a violent south wind brought a heavy swell and put their galleys in the trough of the sea; but he was carried with his own ships towards a precipitous and craggy shore, and had no hope of escape. Suddenly, however, there blew from the bay a strong south-west wind, and the swell began to run from the land out to sea, so that he was able to reverse his course, and, as he sailed gallantly along, he saw the shore covered with wrecks. For there the wind had cast up the galleys which were in pursuit of him, and many of them had been destroyed. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> took many prisoners and much booty, captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418196ULis class=place long=19.649 lat=41.783>Lissus</a>, and inspired <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> with great confidence by arriving in the nick of time with so large a force. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a> and <a href=/people/3093 target=_blank>Trebellius</a> advised <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to the contrary, and, as chance would have it, a dire suspicion fell upon him that he was wronged as a husband by <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> took the matter much to heart, drove his wife from his house (she was his cousin, being a daughter of the Caius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> who was <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>'s colleague in the consulship), made common cause with <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a> and <a href=/people/3093 target=_blank>Trebellius</a>, and waged war upon <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>.

This course naturally made him odious to the multitude, and to men of worth and uprightness he was not acceptable because of his life in general, as <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> says, nay, he was hated by them. They loathed his ill-timed drunkenness, his heavy expenditures, his debauches with women, his spending the days in sleep or in wandering about with crazed and aching head, the nights in revelry or at shows, or in attendance at the nuptial feasts of mimes and jesters. We are told, at any rate, that he once feasted at the nuptials of <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> the mime, drank all night, and then, early in the morning, when the people summoned him to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, came before them still surfeited with food and vomited into his toga, which one of his friends held at his service. <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a> the mime also was one of those who had the greatest influence with him, and <a href=/people/5592 target=_blank>Cytheris</a>, a woman from the same school of acting, a great favourite, whom he took about with him in a litter on his visits to the cities, and her litter was followed by as many attendants as that of his mother.

The house of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, when put up for sale, was bought by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>; but when he was asked to pay the price for it, he was indignant.

For <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> put away his reprehensible way of living, and turned his thoughts to marriage, taking to wife <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, the widow of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> the demagogue. She was a woman who took no thought for spinning or housekeeping, nor would she deign to bear sway over a man of private station, but she wished to rule a ruler and command a commander. Therefore <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> was indebted to <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a> for teaching <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to endure a woman's sway, since she took him over quite tamed, and schooled at the outset to obey women. However, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> tried, by sportive ways and youthful sallies, to make even <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a> more light-hearted. For instance, when many were going out to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> after his victory in Spain, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> himself went forth.

Then <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, in great distress, before taking the letter, asked whether <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was still alive; and he, after handing her the letter without a word, as she began to open and read it, threw his arms about her and kissed her.

For at the festival of the <a href=/people/7896 target=_blank>Lycaea</a>, which the Romans call <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercalia</a>, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, arrayed in a triumphal robe and seated in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a> upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, was viewing the runners to and fro. Now, the runners to and fro are many noble youths and many of the magistrates, anointed with oil, and with leathern thongs they strike in sport those whom they meet. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was one of these runners, but he gave the ancient usages the go-by, and twining a wreath of laurel round a diadem, he ran with it to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, where he was lifted on high by his fellow runners and put it on the head of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, thus intimating that he ought to be king. When <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> with affected modesty declined the diadem, the people were delighted and clapped their hands. Again <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> tried to put the diadem on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s head, and again <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> pushed it away. This contest went on for some time, a few of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s friends applauding his efforts to force the diadem upon <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but all the people applauding with loud cries when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> refused it. And this was strange, too, that while the people were willing to conduct themselves like the subjects of a king, they shunned the name of king as though it meant the abolition of their freedom. At last <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> rose from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a> in displeasure, and pulling back the toga from his throat cried out that anyone who pleased might smite him there. The wreath, which had been hung upon one of his statues, certain tribunes of the people tore down. These men the people greeted with favouring cries and clapping of hands; but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> deprived them of their office. This incident strengthened the party of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>; and when they were taking count of the friends whom they could trust for their enterprise, they raised a question about <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. The rest were for making him one of them, but <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> opposed it. For, he said, while people were going out to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on his return from Spain, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had travelled with him and shared his tent, and he had sounded him quietly and cautiously; <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had understood him, he said, but had not responded to his advances; <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had not, however, reported the conversation to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but had faithfully kept silence about it. Upon this, the conspirators again took counsel to kill <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> after they had slain <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; but <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> prevented this, urging that the deed adventured in behalf of law and justice must be pure and free from injustice. But the conspirators were afraid of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s strength, and of the consideration which his office gave him, and therefore appointed some of their number to look out for him, in order that, when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> entered the senate-chamber and their deed was about to be done, they might engage <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> outside in conversation about some urgent matter and detain him there. </p>                        </div>

And when the young man refused to listen to this, and demanded the moneys, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> kept saying and doing many things to insult him.

But it was his nature to rise to his highest level when in an evil plight, and he was most like a good and true man when he was unfortunate.

But when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> came and encamped near by, he met with no tokens of friendliness, and therefore determined upon a bold stroke. His hair was unkempt, and his beard had been allowed to grow long ever since his defeat, and putting on a dark garment he came up to the camp of <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> and began to speak.

But <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> would not permit them to lay hands on <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, and next day began to cross the river with his army. He himself was first to plunge in, and made his way towards the opposite bank, seeing already that many of the soldiers of <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> were stretching out their hands to him and tearing down their ramparts. After entering the camp and making himself master of everything, he treated <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> with the greatest kindness.

So the three men came together on a small island in the midst of a river, and there held conference for three days. All other matters were easily agreed upon, and they divided up the whole empire among themselves as though it were an ancestral inheritance; but the dispute about the men who were to be put to death gave them the greatest trouble.

Kings would often come to his doors, and wives of kings, vying with one another in their gifts and their beauty, would yield up their honour for his pleasure; and while at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was wearing himself out in civil strifes and wars, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> himself was enjoying abundant peace and leisure, and was swept back by his passions into his wonted mode of life. Lute-players like Anaxenor, flute-players like <a href=/people/122 target=_blank>Xanthus</a>, one <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a>, a dancer, and such other rabble of Asiatic performers, who surpassed in impudence and effrontery the pests from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, poured like a flood into his quarters and held sway there. It was past all endurance that everything was devoted to these extravagances. For all Asia, like the famous city of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, was filled alike with incense-offerings, Alike with paeans, too, and voice of heavy groans. At any rate, when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> made his entry into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, women arrayed like Bacchanals, and men and boys like <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a> and Pans, led the way before him, and the city was full of ivy and thyrsus-wands and harps and pipes and flutes, the people hailing him as <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus Carnivorous</a> and Savage. For he took their property from well-born men and bestowed it on flatterers and scoundrels. From many, too, who were actually alive, men got their property by asking him for it on the plea that the owners were dead. The house of a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397227RMag class=place long=22.9 lat=39.4>Magnesia</a> he gave to a cook, who, as we are told, had won reputation by a single supper. But finally, when he was imposing a second contribution on the cities, <a href=/people/3402 target=_blank>Hybreas</a>, speaking in behalf of Asia, plucked up courage to say this: If thou canst take a contribution twice in one year, thou hast power also to make summer for us twice, and harvest-time twice. These words were rhetorical, it is true, and agreeable to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s taste; but the speaker added in plain and bold words that Asia had given him two hundred thousand talents; If, said he, thou hast not received this money, demand it from those who took it; but if thou didst receive it, and hast it not, we are undone. This speech made a powerful impression upon <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>; for he was ignorant of most that was going on, not so much because he was of an easy disposition, as because he was simple enough to trust those about him. For there was simplicity in his nature, and slowness of perception, though when he did perceive his errors he showed keen repentance, and made full acknowledgement to the very men who had been unfairly dealt with, and there was largeness both in his restitution to the wronged and in his punishment of the wrong-doers. Yet he was thought to exceed due bounds more in conferring favours than in inflicting punishments. And his wantonness in mirth and jest carried its own remedy with it. For a man might pay back his jests and insolence, and he delighted in being laughed at no less than in laughing at others. And this vitiated most of his undertakings. For he could not believe that those who used bold speech in jest could flatter him in earnest, and so was easily captivated by their praises, not knowing that some men would mingle bold speech, like a piquant sauce, with flattery, and thus would take away from flattery its cloying character. Such men would use their bold babbling over the cups to make their submissive yielding in matters of business seem to be the way, not of those who associate with a man merely to please him, but of those who are vanquished by superior wisdom. </p>                        </div>

There, indulging in the sports and diversions of a young man of leisure, he squandered and spent upon pleasures that which <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a> calls the most costly outlay, namely, time. For they had an association called The Inimitable Livers, and every day they feasted one another, making their expenditures of incredible profusion. At any rate, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, the physician of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385224PAmp class=place long=22.374 lat=38.53>Amphissa</a>, used to tell my grandfather, <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a>, that he was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> at the time, studying his profession, and that having got well acquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was easily persuaded by him (young man that he was) to take a view of the extravagant preparations for a royal supper. Accordingly, he was introduced into the kitchen, and when he saw all the other provisions in great abundance, and eight wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a> a-roasting, he expressed his amazement at what must be the number of guests. But the cook burst out laughing and said: The guests are not many, only about twelve; but everything that is set before them must be at perfection, and this an instant of time reduces. For it might happen that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> would ask for supper immediately, and after a little while, perhaps, would postpone it and call for a cup of wine, or engage in conversation with some one. Wherefore, he said, not one, but many suppers are arranged; for the precise time is hard to hit. This tale, then, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> used to tell; and he said also that as time went on he became one of the medical attendants of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s oldest son, whom he had of <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>, and that he usually supped with him at his house in company with the rest of his comrades, when the young man did not sup with his father. Accordingly, on one occasion, as a physician was making too bold and giving much annoyance to them as they supped, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> stopped his mouth with some such sophism as the: To the patient who is somewhat feverish cold water must be given; but everyone who has a fever is somewhat feverish; therefore to everyone who has a fever cold water should be given. The fellow was confounded and put to silence, whereat <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s son was delighted and said with a laugh: All this I bestow upon thee, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, pointing to a table covered with a great many large beakers. <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> acknowledged his good intentions, but was far from supposing that a boy so young had the power to give away so much. After a little while, however, one of the slaves brought the beakers to him in a sack, and bade him put his seal upon it. And when <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> protested and was afraid to take them, You miserable man, said the fellow, why hesitate? Don't you know that the giver is the son of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and that he has the right to bestow so many golden vessels? However, take my advice and exchange them all with us for money; since perchance the boy's father might miss some of the vessels, which are of ancient workmanship and highly valued for their art. Such details, then, my grandfather used to tell me, <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a> would recount at every opportunity. </p>                        </div>

In the meantime <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>, the king's son, advanced again with a large army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>; but <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a> engaged and routed him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367370UKyr class=place long=36.959 lat=36.7442>Cyrrhestica</a>, and slew great numbers of his men. <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a> fell among the first.

He insisted that this one exploit at least should bear his own name, and that not all the successes should be due to <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>.

And finally, like the stubborn and unmanageable beast of the soul, of which <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> speaks, he spurned away all saving and noble counsels and sent <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a> <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> to bring <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>.

However, since he was an adept at putting a good face upon shameful deeds, he used to say that the greatness of the Roman empire was made manifest, not by what the Romans received, but by what they bestowed; and that noble families were extended by the successive begettings of many kings.

And now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> presented themselves to the besiegers in brilliant array, and threatened them insultingly. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, therefore, not wishing that the inactivity of his army should confirm and increase among them consternation and dejection, took ten legions and three praetorian cohorts of men-at arms, together with all his cavalry, and led them out to forage, thinking that in this way the enemy would best be drawn into a pitched battle. After advancing a single day's march, he saw that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> were enveloping him and seeking to attack him on the march. He therefore displayed the signal for battle in his camp, and after taking down his tents, as though his purpose was not to fight but to withdraw, he marched along past the line of the Barbarians, which was crescent-shaped. But he had given orders that when the first ranks of the enemy should appear to be within reach of his legionaries, the cavalry should charge upon them. To the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> in their parallel array, the discipline of the Romans seemed to beggar description, and they watched them marching past at equal distances from one another, without confusion, and in silence, brandishing their javelins. But when the signal was given, and the Roman horsemen wheeled about and rode down upon them with loud shouts, they did indeed receive their onset and repel them, although their foes were at once too close for them to use their arrows; when, however, the legionaries joined in the charge, with shouts and clashing of weapons, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> took fright and gave way, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> fled without coming to close quarters. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> pressed hard upon them in pursuit, and had great hopes that he had finished the whole war, or the greater part of it, in that one battle. His infantry kept up the pursuit for fifty furlongs, and his cavalry for thrice that distance; and yet when he took count of those of the enemy who had fallen or had been captured, he found only thirty prisoners and eighty dead bodies. Despondency and despair therefore fell upon all; they thought it a terrible thing that when victorious they had killed so few, and when vanquished they were to be robbed of so many men as they had lost at the waggons. On the following day they packed up and started on the road to <a href=/people/8168 target=_blank>Phraata</a> and their camp. As they marched they met, first a few of the enemy, then more of them, and finally the whole body, which, as though unconquered and fresh, challenged and attacked them from every side; but at last, with difficulty and much labour, they got safely to their camp. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> made a sally against their mound and put its defenders to flight. At this <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was enraged, and visited those who had played the coward with what is called decimation. That is, he divided the whole number of them into tens, and put to death that one from each ten upon whom the lot fell. For the rest he ordered rations of barley instead of wheat. </p>                        </div>

He therefore contrived the following stratagem. Those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> who were most acquainted with the Romans attacked them less vigorously in their forays for provisions and other encounters, allowing them to take some things, praising their valour, and declaring that they were capital fighting men and justly admired by their own king. After this, they would ride up nearer, and quietly putting their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> alongside the Romans, would revile <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> because, when <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a> wished to come to terms and spare so many such excellent men, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> would not give him an opportunity, but sat there awaiting those grievous and powerful enemies, famine and winter, which would make it difficult for them to escape even though the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> should escort them on their way. Many persons reported this to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, but though his hope inclined him to yield, he did not send heralds to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> until he had inquired of the Barbarians who were showing such kindness whether what they said represented the mind of their king. They assured him that it did, and urged him to have no fear or distrust, whereupon he sent some of his companions with a renewed demand for the return of the standards and the captives, that he might not be thought altogether satisfied with an escape in safety. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> told him not to urge this matter, and assured him of peace and safety as soon as he started to go away; whereupon, within a few days <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> packed up his baggage and broke camp. But though he was persuasive in addressing a popular audience and was better endowed by nature than any man of his time for leading an army by force of eloquence, he could not prevail upon himself, for shame and dejection of spirits, to make the usual speech of encouragement to the army, but ordered <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1039 target=_blank>Ahenobarbus</a> to do it. Some of the soldiers were incensed at this, and felt that he had held them in contempt; but the majority of them were moved to the heart as they comprehended the reason. Therefore they thought they ought to show all the more respect and obedience to their commander. </p>                        </div>

On hearing this, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> took counsel with himself. He did not wish to have the appearance of distrusting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, now that a truce had been made, but since he approved of the shorter road and of having their march take them past inhabited villages, he asked the Mardian for a pledge of his good faith.

But on the third day, when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had put the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> entirely out of his thoughts, and was marching along in looser order because of his confidence, the Mardian noticed that a dike of the river had been recently torn away, and that the stream was flowing out in great volume towards the road over which their march must be made. He comprehended that this was the work of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, throwing the river in their way to obstruct and delay the Roman march, and urged <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to look out and be on his guard, as the enemy were near. And just as <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was setting his legionaries in array and arranging to have his javelineers and slingers make a sally through them against the enemy, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> came into view and began to ride around the army in order to envelop and throw it into confusion on all sides.

Consequently the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, during four successive days, suffered greater loss than they inflicted, became less eager, and made the winter an excuse for thoughts of going away. On the fifth day, however, <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, an efficient and able soldier in high command, came to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and asked him for more light-armed troops from the rear, and for some of the horsemen from the van, confident that he would achieve a great success. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> gave him the troops, and when the enemy attacked, <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> beat them back, not withdrawing and leading them on towards the legionaries, as before, but resisting and engaging them more hazardously. The leaders of the rear guard, seeing that he was being cut off from them, sent and called him back; but he would not listen to them. Then, they say, <a href=/people/1275 target=_blank>Titius</a> the quaestor laid hold of his standards and tried to turn them back, abusing <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> for throwing away the lives of so many brave men.

Then the leaders of the legionaries, among whom was <a href=/people/2846 target=_blank>Canidius</a>, a man of the greatest influence with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, are thought to have made no slight mistake. For when they ought to have wheeled their entire line against the enemy, they sent only a few men at a time to help <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, and again, when one detachment had been overcome, sent out others, and so, before they were aware of it, they came near plunging the whole army into defeat and flight. But <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> himself speedily came with his legionaries from the van to confront the fugitives, and the third legion speedily pushed its way through them against the enemy and checked his further pursuit. </p>                        </div>

The wounded men, however, with cheerful faces, seized his hand and exhorted him to go away and take care of himself, and not to be distressed. They called him Imperator, and said that they were safe if only he were unharmed. For, to put it briefly, no other imperator of that day appears to have assembled an army more conspicuous for prowess, endurance, or youthful vigour. Nay, the respect which his soldiers felt for him as their leader, their obedience and goodwill, and the degree to which all of them alike — men of good repute or men of no repute, commanders or private soldiers — preferred honour and favour from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to life and safety, left even the ancient Romans nothing to surpass. And the reasons for this were many, as I have said before: his high birth, his eloquence, his simplicity of manners, his love of giving and the largeness of his giving, his complaisance in affairs of pleasure or social intercourse. And so at this time, by sharing in the toils and distresses of the unfortunate and bestowing upon them whatever they wanted, he made the sick and wounded more eager in his service than the well and strong. </p>                        </div>

At daybreak, too, they gathered for attack in far greater numbers, and there are said to have been no fewer than forty thousand horsemen, since their king had sent even those who were always arrayed about his person, assured that it was to manifest and assured success; for the king himself was never present at a battle. Then <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, wishing to harangue his soldiers, called for a dark robe, that he might be more pitiful in their eyes.

For they thought they were riding up for plunder and booty, not battle, and when they encountered many missiles and saw that the Romans were fresh and vigorous and eager for the fray, they were once more tired of the struggle. However, as the Romans were descending some steep hills, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> attacked them and shot at them as they slowly moved along. Then the shield-bearers wheeled about, enclosing the lighter armed troops within their ranks, while they themselves dropped on one knee and held their shields out before them.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, however, thinking that the Romans dropping on one knee was a sign of fatigue and exhaustion, laid aside their bows, grasped their spears by the middle and came to close quarters.

This happened also on the following days as the Romans, little by little, proceeded on their way. Famine also attacked the army, which could provide itself with little grain even by fighting, and was not well furnished with implements for grinding. These had been abandoned, for the most part, since some of the beasts of burden died, and the others had to carry the sick and wounded. It is said that one <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> choenix of wheat brought fifty drachmas; and loaves of barley bread were sold for their weight in silver. Resorting, therefore, to vegetables and roots, they could find few to which they were accustomed, and were compelled to make trial of some never tasted before. Thus it was that they partook of an herb which produced madness, and then death. He who ate of it had no memory, and no thought of anything else than the one task of moving or turning every stone, as if he were accomplishing something of great importance. The plain was full of men stooping to the ground and digging around the stones or removing them; and finally they would vomit bile and die, since the only remedy, wine, was not to be had.

But as he was about to do this, there came a man to the camp from the enemy, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> by name, a cousin of the <a href=/people/4615 target=_blank>Monaeses</a> who had been with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and had received the three cities as a gift. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> asked that someone should come to him who could speak the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> or Syrian language.

For he knew that even were there no enemy the lack of roads through the plains would involve them in blind and grievous wanderings, and he showed them that the rough road through the mountains had no other annoyance than lack of water for a single day. Accordingly, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> took this route and led his army along by night, after ordering his men to carry water with them. The greater part of them, however, had no vessels, and therefore some actually filled their helmets with water and carried them, while others took it in skins. But word was at once brought to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was advancing, and contrary to their custom they set out in pursuit while it was yet night. Just as the sun was rising they came up with the rear-guard of the Romans, which was foredone with sleeplessness and toil; for they had accomplished two hundred and forty furlongs in the night. Moreover, they did not expect that the enemy would come upon them so quickly, and were therefore disheartened. Besides, their contest intensified their thirst; for they had to ward off the enemy and make their way forward at the same time. Those who marched in the van came to a river, the water of which was clear and cold, but had a salty taste and was poisonous. This water, as soon as one drank it, caused pains, accompanied by cramping of the bowels and an inflammation of one's thirst. Of this too the Mardian had warned them, but none the less the soldiers forced aside those who tried to turn them back, and drank. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> went round and begged the men to hold out a little while; for not far ahead, he said, there was another river which was potable, and then the rest of the way was too rough for cavalry, so that the enemy must certainly turn back. At the same time, too, he called his men back from fighting and gave the signal for pitching the tents, that the soldiers might at least enjoy the shade a little. </p>                        </div>

The enemy did not molest them, but they themselves made that night of all other nights the most grievous and fearful for themselves. For those who had gold or silver were slain and robbed of it, and the goods were plundered from the beasts of burden; and finally the baggage-carriers of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> were attacked, and beakers and costly tables were cut to pieces or distributed about. And now, since there was great confusion and straggling throughout the whole army (for they thought that the enemy had fallen upon them and routed and dispersed them), <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> called one of the freedmen in his body-guard, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382240DRha class=place long=24.027 lat=38.222>Rhamnus</a> by name, and made him take oath that, at the word of command, he would thrust his sword through him and cut off his head, that he might neither be taken alive by the enemy nor recognized when he was dead. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s friends burst into tears, but the Mardian tried to encourage him, declaring that the river was near: for a breeze blowing from it was moist, and a cooler air in their faces made their breathing pleasanter. He said also that the time during which they had been marching made his estimate of the distance conclusive; for little of the night was now left. At the same time, too, others brought word that the tumult was a result of their own iniquitous and rapacious treatment of one another. Therefore, wishing to bring the throng into order after their wandering and distraction, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> ordered the signal to be given for encampment. </p>                        </div>

These were her words, and she confirmed them by her deeds. For she dwelt in her husband's house, just as if he were at home, and she cared for his children, not only those whom she herself, but also those whom <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a> had borne him, in a noble and magnificent manner; she also received such friends of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> as were sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in quest of office or on business, and helped them to obtain from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> what they wanted.

But he himself took <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> with him and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. It was there that his naval force was coming together from all quarters, eight hundred ships of war with merchant vessels, of which <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> furnished two hundred, besides twenty thousand talents, and supplies for the whole army during the war. But <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, listening to the advice of <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and sundry others, ordered <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and there await the result of the war. <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, however, fearing that <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a> would again succeed in putting a stop to the war, persuaded <a href=/people/2846 target=_blank>Canidius</a> by large bribes to plead her cause with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and to say that it was neither just to drive away from the war a woman whose contributions to it were so large, nor was it for the interest of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to dispirit the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, who formed a large part of his naval force; and besides, it was not easy to see how <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> was inferior in intelligence to anyone of the princes who took part in the expedition, she who for a long time had governed so large a kingdom by herself, and by long association with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had learned to manage large affairs. These arguments (since it was destined that everything should come into <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s hands) prevailed; and with united forces they sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> and there made merry.

For he was lacking in many things, and people were vexed by the exactions of taxes. The citizens were generally compelled to pay one fourth of their income, and the freedmen one eighth of their property, and both classes cried out against <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and disturbances arising from these causes prevailed throughout all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Wherefore, among the greatest mistakes of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> men reckon his postponement of the war. For it gave <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> time to make preparations and put an end to the disturbances among the people. For while money was being exacted from them, they were angry, but when it had been exacted and they had paid it, they were calm.

This will was on deposit with the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal Virgins</a>, and when <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> asked for it, they would not give it to him; but if he wanted to take it, they told him to come and do so. So he went and took it; and to begin with, he read its contents through by himself; and marked certain reprehensible passages; then he assembled the senate and read it aloud to them, although most of them were displeased to hear him do so. For they thought it a strange and grievous matter that a man should be called to account while alive for what he wished to have done after his death. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> laid most stress on the clause in the will relating to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s burial.

He also behaved with magnanimity towards <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, contrary to the judgment of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>. For when <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, who was already in a fever, got into a small boat and went over to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, though deeply chagrined, nevertheless, sent off to him all his baggage, together with his friends and servants.

However, <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> prevailed with her opinion that the war should be decided by the ships, although she was already contemplating flight, and was disposing her own forces, not where they would be helpful in winning the victory, but where they could most easily get away if the cause was lost. Moreover, there were two long walls extending down to the naval station from the camp, and between these <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was wont to pass without suspecting any danger.

As for the leaders themselves, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> visited all his ships in a row-boat, exhorting the soldiers, owing to the weight of their ships, to fight without changing their position, as if they were on land; he also ordered the masters of the ships to receive the attacks of the enemy as if their ships were lying quietly at anchor, and to maintain their position at the mouth of the gulf, which was narrow and difficult. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, we are told, who had left his tent while it was still dark and was going round to visit his ships, was met by a man driving an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> asked the man his name, and he, recognizing <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, replied: My name is Prosper, and my <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s name is Victor. Therefore, when <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> afterwards decided the place with the beaks of ships, he set up bronze figures of an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> and a man. After surveying the rest of his line of battle, he was carried in a small boat to his right wing, and there was astonished to see the enemy lying motionless in the narrows; indeed, their ships had the appearance of riding at anchor. For a long time he was convinced that this was really the case, and kept his own ships at a distance of about eight furlongs from the enemy. But it was now the sixth hour, and since a wind was rising from the sea, the soldiers of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> became impatient at the delay, and, relying on the height and size of their own ships as making them unassailable, they put their left wing in motion. When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> saw this he was delighted, and ordered his right wing to row backwards, wishing to draw the enemy still farther out from the gulf and the narrows, and then to surround them with his own agile vessels and come to close quarters with ships which, owing to their great size and the smallness of their crews, were slow and ineffective. </p>                        </div>

For their beaks would easily have been broken off by impact against vessels constructed of huge square timbers fastened together with iron. The struggle was therefore like a land battle; or, to speak more truly, like the storming of a walled town. For three or four of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s vessels were engaged at the same time about one of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s, and the crews fought with wicker shields and spears and punting-poles and fiery missiles; the soldiers of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> also shot with catapults from wooden towers. And now, as <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was extending the left wing with a view to encircling the enemy, <a href=/people/2252 target=_blank>Publicola</a> was forced to advance against him, and so was separated from the centre. The centre falling into confusion and engaging with <a href=/people/3344 target=_blank>Arruntius</a>, although the sea-fight was still undecided and equally favourable to both sides, suddenly the sixty ships of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> were seen hoisting their sails for flight and making off through the midst of the combatants; for they had been posted in the rear of the large vessels, and threw them into confusion as they plunged through. The enemy looked on with amazement, seeing that they took advantage of the wind and made for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>. Here, indeed, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> made it clear to all the world that he was swayed neither by the sentiments of a commander nor of a brave man, nor even by his own, but, as someone in pleasantry said that the soul of the lover dwells in another's body, he was dragged along by the woman as if he had become incorporate with her and must go where she did. For no sooner did he see her ship sailing off than he forgot everything else, betrayed and ran away from those who were fighting and dying in his cause, got into a five-oared galley, where <a href=/people/3329 target=_blank>Alexas</a> the Syrian and Scellius were his only companions, and hastened after the woman who had already ruined him and would make his ruin still more complete. </p>                        </div>

Instead, he went forward alone to the prow and sat down by himself in silence, holding his head in both hands. At this point, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=demonym long=15.4 lat=44>Liburnian</a> ships were seen pursuing them from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s fleet; but <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> ordered the ship's prow turned to face them, and so kept them off, except the ship of <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=person long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a>, who attacked vigorously, and brandished a spear on the deck as though he would cast it at <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. And when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, standing at the prow, asked, Who is this that pursues <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>? the answer was, I am <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> the son of <a href=/people/1538 target=_blank>Lachares</a>, whom the fortune of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> enables to avenge the death of his father. Now, <a href=/people/1538 target=_blank>Lachares</a> had been beheaded by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> because he was involved in a charge of robbery. However, <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> did not hit <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s ship, but smote the other admiral's ship (for there were two of them) with his bronze beak and whirled her round, and one of the other ships also, which contained costly equipment for household use. When <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> was gone, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> threw himself down again in the same posture and did not stir. He spent three days by himself at the prow, either because he was angry with <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, or ashamed to see her, and then put in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a>. Here the women in <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s company at first brought them into a parley, and then persuaded them to eat and sleep together. Presently not a few of their heavy transport ships and some of their friends began to gather about them after the defeat, bringing word that the fleet was destroyed, but that, in their opinion, the land forces still held together. So <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> sent messengers to <a href=/people/2846 target=_blank>Canidius</a>, ordering him to retire with his army as fast as he could through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> into Asia; he himself, however, since he purposed to cross from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364225STai class=place long=22.4867 lat=36.4018>Taenarum</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, selected one of the transport ships which carried much coined money and very valuable royal utensils in silver and gold, and made a present of it to his friends, bidding them divide up the treasure and look out for their own safety. They refused his gift and were in tears, but he comforted them and besought them with great kindness and affection, and finally sent them away, after writing to <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, his steward in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, that he should keep the men in safe hiding until they could make their peace with <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>.

There were not more than five thousand dead, but three hundred ships were captured, as <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself has written. Only a few were aware that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had fled, and to those who heard of it the story was at first an incredible one, that he had gone off and left nineteen legions of undefeated men-at arms and twelve thousand horsemen, as if he had not many times experienced both kinds of fortune and were not exercised by the reverses of countless wars and fightings. His soldiers, too, had a great longing for him, and expected that he would presently make his appearance from some quarter or other; and they displayed so much fidelity and bravery that even after his flight had become evident they held together for seven days, paying no heed to the messages which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> sent them. But at last, after <a href=/people/2846 target=_blank>Canidius</a> their general had run away by night and forsaken the camp, being now destitute of all things and betrayed by their commanders, they went over to the conqueror.

But when she saw that the speedy poisons enhanced the sharpness of death by the pain they caused, while the milder poisons were not quick, she made trial of venomous animals, watching with her own eyes as they were set upon another. She did this daily, tried them almost all; and she found that the bite of the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>asp</a> alone induced a sleepy torpor and sinking, where there was no spasm or groan, but a gentle perspiration on the face, while the perceptive faculties were easily relaxed and dimmed, and resisted all attempts to rouse and restore them, as is the case with those who are soundly asleep. </p>                        </div>

And at supper, we are told, he bade the slaves pour out for him and feast him more generously; for it was uncertain, he said, whether they would be doing this on the morrow, or whether they would be serving other masters, while he himself would be lying dead, a mummy and a nothing. Then, seeing that his friends were weeping at these words, he declared that he would not lead them out to battle, since from it he sought an honourable death for himself rather than safety and victory. During this night, it is said, about the middle of it, while the city was quiet and depressed through fear and expectation of what was coming, suddenly certain harmonious sounds from all sorts of instruments were heard, and the shouting of a throng, accompanied by cries of Bacchic revelry and satyric leapings, as if a troop of revellers, making a great tumult, were going forth from the city; and their course seemed to lie about through the middle of the city toward the outer gate which faced the enemy, at which point the tumult became loudest and then dashed out.

But the crews of his ships, as soon as they were near, saluted <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s crews with their oars, and on their returning the salute changed sides, and so all the ships, now united into one fleet, sailed up towards the city prows on. No sooner had <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> seen this than he was deserted by his cavalry, which went over to the enemy, and after being defeated with his infantry he retired into the city, crying out that he had been betrayed by <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> to those with whom he waged war for her sake. But she, fearing his anger and his madness, fled for refuge into her tomb and let fall the drop-doors, which were made strong with bolts and bars; then she sent messengers to tell <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> that she was dead. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> believed that message, and saying to himself, Why doest thou longer delay, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>? <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> has taken away thy sole remaining excuse for clinging to life, he went into his chamber. Here, as he unfastened his breastplate and laid it aside, he said: O <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, I am not grieved to be bereft of thee, for I shall straightway join thee; but I am grieved that such an imperator as I am has been found to be inferior to a woman in courage.

Him <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had long before engaged, in case of need, to kill him, and now demanded the fulfilment of his promise. So <a href=/people/6467 target=_blank>Eros</a> drew his sword and held it up as though he would smite his master, but then turned his face away and slew himself.

But the wound did not bring a speedy death. Therefore, as the blood ceased flowing after he had lain down, he came to himself and besought the bystanders to give him the finishing stroke. But they fled from the chamber, and he lay writhing and crying out, until <a href=/people/2615 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> the secretary came from <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> with orders to bring him to her in the tomb. </p>                        </div>

To these <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was fastened, and she drew him up herself, with the aid of the two women whom alone she had admitted with her into the tomb. Never, as those who were present tell us, was there a more piteous sight. Smeared with blood and struggling with death he was drawn up, stretching out his hands to her even as he dangled in the air. For the task was not an easy one for the women, and scarcely could <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, with clinging hands and strained face, pull up the rope, while those below called out encouragement to her and shared her agony. And when she had thus got him in and laid him down, she rent her garments over him, beat and tore her breasts with her hands, wiped off some of his blood upon her face, and called him master, husband, and imperator; indeed, she almost forgot her own ills in her pity for his. But <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> stopped her lamentations and asked for a drink of wine, either because he was thirsty, or in the hope of a speedier release.

When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> heard these tidings, he retired within his tent and wept for a man who had been his relation by marriage, his colleague in office and command, and his partner in many undertakings and struggles.

But in consequence of so much grief as well as pain (for her breasts were wounded and inflamed by the blows she gave them) a fever assailed her, and she welcomed it as an excuse for abstaining from food and so releasing herself from life without hindrance.

She was lying on a mean pallet-bed, clad only in her tunic, but sprang up as he entered and thew herself at his feet; her hair and face were in terrible disarray, her voice trembled, and her eyes were sunken. There were also visible many marks of the cruel blows upon her bosom; in a word, her body seemed to be no better off than her spirit. Nevertheless, the charm for which she was famous and the boldness of her beauty were not altogether extinguished, but, although she was in such a sorry plight, they shone forth from within and made themselves manifest in the play of her features. After <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had bidden her to lie down and had seated himself near her, she began a sort of justification of her course, ascribing it to necessity and fear of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>; but as <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> opposed and refuted her on every point, she quickly changed her tone and sought to move his pity by prayers, as one who above all things clung to life. And finally she gave him a list which she had of all her treasures; and when <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, one of her stewards, showed conclusively that she was stealing away and hiding some of them, she sprang up, seized him by the hair, and showered blows upon his face. And when <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, with a smile, stopped her, she said: But is it not a monstrous thing, O <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that when thou hast deigned to come to me and speak to me though I am in this wretched plight, my slaves denounce me for reserving some women's adornments, — not for myself, indeed, unhappy woman that I am, — but that I may make trifling gifts to <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a> and thy <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>, and through their intercession find thee merciful and more gentle? <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was pleased with this speech, being altogether of the opinion that she desired to live. He told her, therefore, that he left these matters for her to manage, and that in all other ways he would give her more splendid treatment than she could possibly expect. Then he went off, supposing that he had deceived her, but the rather deceived by her. </p>                        </div>

This man was not without a certain tenderness for <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>; and so now, in response to her request, he secretly sent word to her that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself was preparing to march with his land forces through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and had resolved to send off her and her children within three days.

Do not expect other honours or libations; these are the last from <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> the captive.

After her bath, she reclined at table and was making a sumptuous meal. And there came a man from the country carrying a basket; and when the guards asked him what he was bringing there, he opened the basket, took away the leaves, and showed them that the dish inside was full of figs. The guards were amazed at the great size and beauty of the figs, whereupon the man smiled and asked them to take some; so they felt no mistrust and bade him take them in. After her meal, however, <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> took a tablet which was already written upon and sealed, and sent it to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and then, sending away all the rest of the company except her two faithful women, she closed the doors. But <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> opened the tablet, and when he found there lamentations and supplications of one who begged that he would bury her with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, he quickly knew what had happened. At first he was minded to go himself and give aid; then he ordered messengers to go with all speed and investigate. But the mischief had been swift. For though his messengers came on the run and found the guards as yet aware of nothing, when they opened the doors they found <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> lying dead upon a golden couch, arrayed in royal state. And of her two women, the one called Iras was dying at her feet, while <a href=/people/6348 target=_blank>Charmion</a>, already tottering and heavy-handed, was trying to arrange the diadem which encircled the queen's brow.

But others say that the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>asp</a> was kept carefully shut up in a water jar, and that while <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> was stirring it up and irritating it with a golden distaff it sprang and fastened itself upon her arm. But the truth of the matter no one knows; for it was also said that she carried about poison in a hollow comb and kept the comb hidden in her hair; and yet neither spot nor other sign of poison broke out upon her body. Moreover, not even was the reptile seen within the chamber, though people said they saw some traces of it near the sea, where the chamber looked out upon it with its windows. And some also say that <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s arm was seen to have two slight and indistinct punctures; and this <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> also seems to have believed.

When <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> died she was forty years of age save one, and had shared her power with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> more than fourteen. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was fifty-six years of age, according to some, according to others, fifty-three. Now, the statues of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> were torn down, but those of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> were left standing, because <a href=/people/5454 target=_blank>Archibius</a>, one of her friends, gave <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> two thousand talents, in order that they might not suffer the same fate as <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s. </p>                        </div>
