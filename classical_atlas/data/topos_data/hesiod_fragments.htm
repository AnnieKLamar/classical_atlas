He had a son of remarkable beauty, <a href=/people/846 target=_blank>Hymenaeus</a>. And when <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> saw the boy, he was seized with love for him, and would not leave the house of <a href=/people/4344 target=_blank>Magnes</a>. Then <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> made designs on <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>'s herd of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> which were grazing in the same place as the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>. First he cast upon the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> which were guarding them a stupor and strangles, so that the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> forgot the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> and lost the power of barking. Then he drove away twelve heifers and a hundred <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> never yoked, and the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> who mounted the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, fastening to the tail of each one brushwood to wipe out the footmarks of the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>. He drove them through the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgi</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a> in the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=place long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a>, and through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=place long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locris</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megaris</a>, and thence into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=place long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larissa</a>, until he brought them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>. From there he went on by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375220LLyk class=demonym long=21.975 lat=37.4569>Lycaean</a> mountains, and past <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377223LMai class=place long=22.262 lat=37.653>Maenalus</a> and what are called the watch-posts of <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a>. Now this <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> used to live on the top of the rock and when he heard the voice of the heifers as they were being driven past, he came out from his own place, and knew that the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> were stolen. So he asked for a reward to tell no one about them. <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> promised to give it him on these terms, and <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> swore to say nothing to anyone about the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. But when <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> had hidden them in the cliff by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370217LKor class=place long=21.658 lat=36.951>Coryphasium</a>, and had driven them into a cave facing towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, he changed himself and came again to <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> and tried whether he would be true to him as he had vowed. So, offering him a robe as a reward, he asked of him whether he had noticed stolen <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> being driven past. And <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a> took the robe and told him about the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. But <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> was angry because he was double-tongued, and struck him with his staff and changed him into a rock. And either frost or heat never leaves him. </p>                        </div>
