                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg035:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene At Pherae, outside the Palace of ADMETUS, King of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>. The centre of the scene represents a portico with columns and a large double-door. To the left are the women's quarters, to the right the guest rooms. The centre doors of the Palace slowly open inwards, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> comes out. In his left hand he carries a large unstrung golden bow. He moves slowly and majestically, turns, and raises his right hand in salutation to the Palace. <br />APOLLO: Dwelling of <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>, wherein I, a God, deigned to accept the food of serfs! The cause was <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. He struck <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, my son, full in the breast with a bolt of thunder, and laid him dead. Then in wild rage I slew the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a> who forge the fire of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. To atone for this my Father forced me to labour as a hireling for a mortal man; and I came to this country, and tended <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> for my host. To this hour I have protected him and his. I, who am just, chanced on the son of <a href=/people/1414 target=_blank>Pheres</a>, a just man, whom I have saved from <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> by tricking the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a>. The Goddesses pledged me their faith <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> should escape immediate death if, in exchange, another corpse were given to the Under-Gods. One by one he tested all his friends, and even his father and the old mother who bad brought him forth-and found none that would die for him and never more behold the light of day, save only his wife. Now, her spirit waiting to break loose, she droops upon his arm within the house; this is the day when she must die and render up her life. But I must leave this Palace's dear roof, for fear pollution soil me in the house. See! <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>, Lord of All the Dead, now comes to lead her to the house of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>! Most punctually he comes! How well he marked the day she had to die! From the right comes DEATH, with a drawn sword in his hand. He moves stealthily towards the Palace; then sees APOLLO and halts abruptly. The two Deities confront each other. <br />DEATH: Ha! <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>! You! Before this Palace! Lawlessly would you grasp, abolish the rights of the Lower Gods! Did you not beguile the <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fates</a> and snatch <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> from the grave? Does not that suffice? Now, once again, you have armed your hand with the bow, to guard the daughter of <a href=/people/390 target=_blank>Pelias</a> who must die in her husband's stead! <br />APOLLO: Fear not! I hold for right, and proffer you just words. <br />DEATH: If you hold for right, why then your bow? <br />APOLLO: My custom is ever to carry it. <br />DEATH: Yes! And you use it unjustly to aid this house! <br />APOLLO: I grieve for a friend's woe. <br />DEATH: So you would rob me of a second body? <br />APOLLO: Not by force I won the other. </p>                        </div>

I know not if I can persuade you... <br />DEATH: Not to kill her I must kill? I am appointed to that task. <br />APOLLO: No, no! But to delay death for those about to die. <br />DEATH: I hear your words and guess your wish! <br />APOLLO: May not <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a> live to old age? <br />DEATH: No! I also prize my rights! <br />APOLLO: Yet at most you win one life. <br />DEATH: They who die young yield me a greater prize. <br />APOLLO: If she dies old, the burial will be richer. <br />DEATH: <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, that argument favours the rich. <br />APOLLO: What! Are you witty unawares? <br />DEATH: The rich would gladly pay to die old. <br />APOLLO: So you will not grant me this favour? <br />DEATH: Not I! You know my nature. <br />APOLLO: Yes! Hateful to men and a horror to the gods! <br />DEATH: You cannot always have more than your due. <br />APOLLO: Yet you shall change, most cruel though you are!

But now from the house comes one of her women servants, all in tears. What now shall I learn?

For such a husband what loss is such a wife! <br />SERVANT: The King will not know his loss until he suffers it. <br />LEADER: Then there is no hope that her life may be saved? <br />SERVANT: The fated day constrains her. <br />LEADER: Are all things befitting prepared for her? <br />SERVANT: The robes in which her lord will bury her are ready. <br />LEADER: Then let her know that she dies gloriously, the best of women beneath the sun by far! <br />SERVANT: How should she not be the best! Who shall deny it? What should the best among women be? How better might a woman hold faith to her lord than gladly to die for him? This the whole city knows, but you will marvel when you hear what she has done within the house. When she knew that the last of her days was come she bathed her white body in river water, she took garments and gems from her rooms of cedar wood, and clad herself nobly; then, standing before the hearth-shrine, she uttered this prayer: 'O Goddess, since now I must descend beneath the earth, for the last time I make supplication to you: and entreat you to protect my motherless children. Wed my son to a fair bride, and my daughter to a noble husband. Let not my children die untimely, as I their mother am destroyed, but grant that they live out happy lives with good fortune in their own land!' To every altar in <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>'s house she went, hung them with garlands. offered prayer, cut myrtle boughs — unweeping, unlamenting; nor did the coming doom change the bright colour of her face. Then to her marriage-room she went, flung herself down upon her bed, and wept, and said: 'O my marriage-bed, wherein I loosed my virgin girdle to him for whom I die! Farewell! I have no hatred for you. Only me you lose. Because I held my faith to you and to my lord-I must die. Another woman shall possess you, not more chaste indeed than I, more fortunate perhaps.' She fell upon her knees and kissed it, and all the bed was damp with the, tide of tears which flooded to her eyes. And when she was fulfilled of many tears, drooping she rose from her bed and made as if to go, and many times she turned to go and many times turned back, and flung herself once more upon the bed. Her children clung to their mother's dress, and wept; and she clasped them in her arms and kissed them turn by turn, as a dying woman.

Yet he who begot you, she who brought you forth, abandoned you when it had been beautiful in them to die, beautiful to die with dignity to save their son! They had no child but you, no hope if you were dead that other children might be born to them. Thus I should have lived my life out, and you too, and you would not lament as now, made solitary from your wife, that you must rear our children motherless! But these things are a God's doing and are thus. Well! Do not forget this gift, for I shall ask — not a recompense, since nothing is more precious than life, but — only what is just, as you yourself will say, since if you have not lost your senses you must love these children no less than I. Let them be masters in my house; marry not again, and set a stepmother over them, a woman harsher than I, who in her jealousy will lift her hand against my children and yours. Ah! not this, let not this be, I entreat you! The new stepmother hates the first wife's children, the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a> itself is not more cruel. The son indeed finds a strong rampart in his father — but you, my daughter, how shall you live your virgin life out in happiness? How will you fare with your father's new wife? Ah! Let her not cast evil report upon you and thus wreck your marriage in the height of your youth! You will have no mother, O my child, to give you in marriage, to comfort you in childbed when none is tenderer than a mother! And I must die. Not tomorrow. nor tomorrow's morrow comes this misfortune on me, but even now I shall be named with those that are no more. Farewell! Live happy!

But these things must be endured, however intolerable they may be. Take these garments, and let her descend under the earth. Her body must be honoured, for she died to save your life, my son; she has not made me childless, nor left me to be destroyed without you in my hapless old age; and she has given glorious fame to all women by daring so noble a deed! He lifts his hand in salutation to the body of ALCESTIS. O woman, who saved my son, who raised me up when I had fallen, hail! Be happy in the halls of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>! I declare it — such marriages are profitable to mankind; otherwise, it is foolish to marry. <br />ADMETUS furiously It was not my wish that you should come to this burial, and I deny that your presence is that of a friend! She shall never wear these garments of yours; she needs not your gifts for her burial. You should have grieved when I was, about to die; but you stood aside, and now do you come to wail over a corpse when you, an old man, allowed a young woman to die? Were you in very truth father of this body of mine? Did she, who claims to be and is called my mother, bring me forth? Or was I bred of a slave's seed and secretly brought to your wife's breast? You have proved what you are when it comes to the test, and therefore I am not your begotten son; or you surpass all men in cowardice, for, being at the very verge and end of life, you had neither courage nor will to die for your son. But this you left to a woman, a stranger, whom alone I hold as my father and my mother! Yet it had been a beautiful deed in you to die for your son, and short indeed was the time left you to live. She and I would have lived out our lives, and I should not now be here alone lamenting my misery. You enjoyed all that a happy man can enjoy — you passed the flower of your age as a king, and in me your son you had an heir to your dominion; you would not have died childless, leaving an orphaned house to be plundered by strangers. You will not say that you abandoned me to death because I dishonoured your old age, for above all I was respectful to you — and this is the gratitude I have from you and my mother! Beget more sons, and quickly, to cherish your old age and wrap you in a shroud when dead and lay your body out in state! This hand of mine shall not inter you. I am dead to you. I look upon the light of day because another saved me-I say I am her son, and will cherish her old age! Vainly do old men pray for death, regretting their age and the long span of life. If death draws near, none wants to die, and age is no more a burden to him. </p>                        </div>

I tell myself that we are a long time underground and that life is short, but sweet. But you — you strove shamelessly not to die, and you are alive, you shirked your fate by killing her!

First, though he saw our Lord was in mourning, he entered, and dared to pass through the gates. Then, knowing our misfortune, he did not soberly accept what was offered him, but if anything was not served to him he ordered us to bring it. In both hands he took a cup of ivy-wood, and drank the unmixed wine of the dark grape-mother, until he was encompassed and heated with the flame of wine. He crowned his head with myrtle sprays, howling discordant songs. There was he caring nothing for <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a>'s misery, and we servants weeping for our Queen; and yet we hid our tear-laden eyes from the guest, for so <a href=/people/1035 target=_blank>Admetus</a> had commanded. And now in the Palace I must entertain this stranger, some villainous thief and brigand, while she, the Queen I mourn, has gone from the house unfollowed, unsaluted, she who was as a mother to me and all us servants, for she sheltered us from a myriad troubles by softening her husband's wrath. Am I not right, then, to hate this stranger, who came to us in the midst of sorrow? <br />HERACLES comes from the Palace. He is drunkenly merry, with a myrtle wreath on his head, and a large cup and wine-skin in his hands. He staggers a little. <br />HERACLES: Hey, you! Why so solemn and anxious? A servant should not be sullen with guests, but greet them with a cheerful heart. You see before you a man who is your lord's friend, and you greet him with a gloomy, frowning face, because of your zeal about a strange woman's death. Come here, and let me make you a little wiser! With drunken gravity Know the nature of human life? Don't think you do. You couldn't. Listen to me. All mortals must die. Isn't one who knows if he'll be alive tomorrow morning. Who knows where <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> will lead? Nobody can teach it. Nobody learn it by rules. So, rejoice in what you hear, and learn from me! Count each day as it comes as Life — and leave the rest to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>. Above all, honour the <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> Goddess, sweetest of all the Gods to mortal men, a kindly goddess! Put all the rest aside. <a href=/people/2182 target=_blank>Trust</a> in what I say, if you think I speak truth — as I believe. Get rid of this gloom, rise superior to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>. Crown yourself with flowers and drink with me, won't you? I know the regular clink of the wine-cup will row you from darkness and gloom to another haven. Mortals should think mortal thoughts. To all solemn and frowning men, life I say is not life, but a disaster. <br />SERVANT: We know all that, but what we endure here today is far indeed from gladness and laughter. <br />HERACLES: But the dead woman was a stranger. Lament not overmuch, then, for the Lords of this Palace are still alive. <br />SERVANT: How, alive?

Hateful approach, hateful sight of my widowed house! Oh me! Oh me! Alas! Whither shall I go? Where rest? What can I say? What refrain from saying? Why can I not die? Indeed my mother bore me for a hapless fate. I envy the dead, I long to be with them, theirs are the dwellings where I would be. Without pleasure I look upon the light of day and set my feet upon the earth — so precious a hostage has <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> taken from me to deliver unto <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>! <br />CHORUS chanting responsively with ADMETUS: Go forward, Enter your house. <br />ADMETUS: Alas! </p>                        </div>

Ere now many men <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a> has severed from wives. <br />ADMETUS speaking O friends, whatsoever may be thought by others, to me it seems that my wife's fate is happier than mine. Now, no pain ever shall touch her again; she has reached the noble end of all her sufferings. But I, I who should have died, I have escaped my fate, only to drag out a wretched life. Only now do I perceive it. How shall I summon strength to enter this house? Whom shall I greet? Who will greet me in joy at my coming? Whither shall I turn my steps? I shall be driven forth by solitude when I see my bed widowed of my wife, empty the chairs on which she sat, a dusty floor beneath my roof, my children falling at my knees and calling for their mother, and the servants lamenting for the noble lady lost from the house! Such will be my life within the house.

Nothing avails against <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a> Neither the Thracian tablets Marked with Orphic symbols, Nor the herbs given by <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> To the children of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> To heal men of their sickness. antistrophe 1 None can come near to her altars, None worship her statues; She regards not our sacrifice. O sacred goddess, Bear no more hardly upon me Than in days overpast! With a gesture <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> judges, But the sentence is yours. Hard iron yields to your strength; Your fierce will knows not gentleness. strophe 2 And the Goddess has bound you Ineluctably in the gyves of her hands. Yield. Can your tears give life to the dead? For the sons of the Gods Swoon in the shadow of <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>. Dear was she in our midst, Dear still among the dead, For the noblest of women was she Who lay in your bed. antistrophe 2 Ah!

The wanderer shall turn from his path, Saying: 'She died for her lord; A blessed spirit she is now. Hail, O sacred lady, be our friend!' Thus shall men speak of her. <br />ADMETUS is still crouched on the Palace steps, when HERACLES enters from the side, leading a veiled woman. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS But see!

Since I was near you in your misfortune, should have wished to show myself your friend. But you did not tell me the dead body was your wife's, and you took me into your house as if you were in mourning only for a stranger. And I put a garland of flowers upon my head, and poured wine-offerings to the Gods, when your house was filled with lamentation. I blame you, yes, I blame you for this — but I will not upbraid you in your misfortune. Why I turned back and am here, I shall tell you. Take and keep this woman for me until I have slain the King of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413248RBis class=ethnic long=25 lat=41.2>Bistones</a> and return here with the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. If ill happens to me — may I return safely!-I give her to you to serve in your house. With much striving I won her to my hands. On my way I found public games, worthy of athletes, and I have brought back this woman whom I won as the prize of victory. The winners of the easy tests had <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; heads of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> were given to those who won in boxing and wrestling. Then came a woman as a prize. Since I was present, it would have been shameful for me to miss this glorious gain. Therefore, as I said, you must take care of this woman, whom I bring to you, not as one stolen but as the prize of my efforts. Perhaps in time you will approve of what I do. <br />ADMETUS: Not from disdain, nor to treat you as a foe, did I conceal my wife's fate from you. But if you had turned aside to another man's hearth, one more grief had been added to my sorrow. It was enough that I should weep my woe. This woman-O King, I beg it may be thus — enjoin some other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>, one who is not in sorrow, to guard her. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394228PPhe class=place long=22.7539 lat=39.379>Pherae</a> there are many to welcome you. Do not remind me of my grief. Seeing her in my house, I could not restrain my tears. Add not a further anguish to my pain, for what I suffer is too great. And then — where could I harbour a young woman in my house? For she is young-I see by her clothes and jewels. Could she live with the men under my roof? How, then, could she remain chaste, if she moved to and fro among the young men? <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, it is not easy to restrain the young....I am thinking of your interests....Must I take her to my dead wife's room? How could I endure her to enter that bed? I fear a double reproach — from my people, who would accuse me of betraying my saviour to slip into another woman's bed, and from my dead wife, who deserves my respect, for which I must take care. O woman, whosoever you may be, you have the form of <a href=/people/1166 target=_blank>Alcestis</a>, and your body is like hers. Ah! By all the Gods, take her from my sight! Do not insult a broken man. When I look upon her — she seems my wife — my heart is torn asunder — tears flow from my eyes. Miserable creature that I am, now taste the bitterness of my sorrow. <br />LEADER: I do not praise this meeting; but, whatever happens, we must accept the gifts of the Gods. <br />HERACLES: Oh, that I might bring your wife back into the light of day from the dwelling of the Under-Gods, as a gift of grace to you! </p>                        </div>
