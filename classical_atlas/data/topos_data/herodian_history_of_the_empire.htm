They feared too that if they remained silent they might be numbered among the countless hordes of the obscure. Such writers are little concerned with truth in their narratives, however, but pay particular attention to phrasing and euphony, since they are confident that even if their writings have no basis in fact, they will still win a hearing, and the accuracy of their research will not be challenged. </p>                        </div>

We would not find the earthquakes, the pollutions of the air, or the incredible careers of tyrants and emperors. 5 Some of these rulers retained their power for a long time; others more briefly. There were even some who, having attained the imperial power and enjoyed the imperial honors for no more than a single day, were immediately killed. Since, in a period of sixty years, the Roman imperial power was held by more emperors than would seem possible in so short a time, many strange and wonderful events took place. 6 The emperors who were advanced in years governed themselves and their subjects commendably, because of their greater practical experience, but the younger emperors lived recklessly and introduced many innovations. As might have been expected, the disparities in age and authority inevitably resulted in variations in imperial behavior. How each of these events occurred, I shall now relate in detail, in order of time and emperors. </p>                        </div>

One of them (his name was <a href=/people/10479 target=_blank>Verissimus</a>) died very young; the surviving son, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, his father reared with great care, summoning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from all over the empire men renowned for learning in their own countries. 2 He paid these scholars large fees to live in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and supervise his son's education. When his daughters came of age, he married them to the most distinguished of the senators, selecting his sons-in-law not from the aristocrats, with their excessive pride in their ancestry, nor from the wealthy, with their protective shield of riches; he preferred men who were modest in manner and moderate in their way of life, for he considered these virtues to be the only fit and enduring possessions of the soul. </p>                        </div>

Alone of the emperors, he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.

When the emperor suspected that there was little hope of his recovery, and realized that his son would become emperor while still very young, he was afraid that the undisciplined youth, deprived of parental advice, might neglect his excellent studies and good habits and turn to drinking and debauchery (for the minds of the young, prone to pleasures, are turned very easily from the virtues of education) when he had absolute and unrestrained power. 2 This learned man was disturbed also by the memory of those who had become sole rulers in their youth. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> despot <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, in his excessive licentiousness, had sought out new pleasures and paid the highest prices for them. The arrogance and violence of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s successors against their subject peoples had brought disgrace upon his empire. 3 <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, too, contrary to the laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and Greeks, went so far as to marry his own sister. <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> had imitated <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> in every way, even wearing a crown of ivy instead of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> hat or the diadem, and carrying the thyrsus instead of a scepter. 4 Marcus was even more distressed when he recalled events of recent date. <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> had capped his crimes by murdering his mother and had made himself ridiculous in the eyes of the people. The exploits of <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, as well, were marked by excessive savagery. 5 When he recalled such spectacles of despotism as these, he was apprehensive and anticipated evil events. Then, too, the Germans on the border gave him much cause for anxiety. He had not yet forced all these tribes to submit; some he had won to an alliance by persuasion; others he had conquered by force of arms. There were some who, although they had broken their pact with him, had returned to the alliance temporarily because of the fear occasioned by the presence of so great an emperor. He suspected that, contemptuous of his son's youth, they would launch an assault upon him; for the barbarian is ever eager to revolt on any pretext. </p>                        </div>

It is natural for men to pity the sufferings of their fellow men, and the misfortunes that occur before their very eyes arouse even greater compassion. I think, however, that an even stronger bond of affection exists between you and me; in return for the favors I have done you, I have a reasonable right to expect your reciprocal good will. 3 And now is the proper time for me to discover that not in vain have I showered honor and esteem upon you for so long, and for you to return the favor by showing that you are not unmindful of the benefits you have received from me. Here is my son, whom you yourselves have educated, approaching the prime of youth and, as it were, in need of pilots for the stormy seas ahead. I fear that he, tossed to and fro by his lack of knowledge of what he needs to know, may be dashed to pieces on the rocks of evil practices. 4 You, therefore, together take my place as his father, looking after him and giving him wise counsel. No amount of money is large enough to compensate for a tyrant's excesses, nor is the protection of his bodyguards enough to shield the ruler who does not possess the good will of his subjects. 5 The ruler who emplants in the hearts of his subjects not fear resulting from cruelty, but love occasioned by kindness, is most likely to complete his reign safely. For it is not those who submit from necessity but those who are persuaded to obedience who continue to serve and to suffer without suspicion and without pretense of flattery. And they never rebel unless they are driven to it by violence and arrogance. 6 When a man holds absolute power, it is difficult for him to control his desires. But if you give my son proper advice in such matters and constantly remind him of what he has heard here, you will make him the best of emperors for yourselves and for all, and you will be paying the greatest tribute to my memory.

He took greater delight, I am convinced, in calling me 'fellow soldier' than in calling me 'son,' for he considered the latter a title bestowed by Nature, the former, a partnership based on excellence. While I was still an infant he often brought me to you and placed me in your arms, a pledge of the trust he had in you. 4 And for that reason I have every hope that I shall enjoy your universal good will, since I am indebted to you old soldiers for rearing me, and I may properly call you young soldiers my fellow students in deeds of arms, for my father loved us all and taught us every good thing. 5 To follow him, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> has given the empire not to an adopted successor but to me.

Up to now, all that you have courageously accomplished is attributable to his wisdom and his generalship.

Instead, she tested the sentiments of a wealthy young nobleman, Quadratus, with whom she was rumored to be sleeping in secret. Complaining constantly about this matter of imperial precedence, she soon persuaded the young man to set in motion a plot which brought destruction upon himself and the entire senate. 5 Quadratus, in selecting confederates among the prominent senators, prevailed upon Quintianus, a bold and reckless young senator, to conceal a dagger beneath his robe and, watching for a suitable time and place, to stab <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>; as for the rest, he assured Quintianus that he would set matters straight by bribes. 6 But the assassin, standing in the entrance to the amphitheater (it was dark there and he hoped to escape detection), drew his dagger and shouted at <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> that he had been sent by the senate to kill him.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> celebrate a sacred festival in honor of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a>, and all the stage shows and athletic exhibitions are sent to take part in this festival in the capital. The emperor is both spectator and judge, together with the rest of the priests, who are summoned in rotation for this duty. 3 Upon his arrival for the performance of the famous actors, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> took his seat in the imperial chair; an orderly crowd filled the theater, quietly occupying the assigned seats. Before any action took place on the stage, however, a man dressed as a philosopher (half-naked, carrying a staff in his hand and a leather bag on his shoulder) ran out and took his stand in the center of the stage. Silencing the audience with a sweep of his hand, he said: 4 <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, this is no time to celebrate festivals and devote yourself to shows and entertainments. The sword of <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> is at your throat. Unless you guard yourself from a danger not threatening but already upon you, you shall not escape death. <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> himself is raising money and an army to oppose you, and his sons are winning over the army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. Unless you act first, you shall die. 5 Whether he said this by divine inspiration, or whether, obscure and unknown before, he was making an effort to gain fame, or hoped to receive a generous reward from the emperor — whatever the reason, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was thunderstruck. Everyone was suspicious of the man's words, and no one believed him. <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> ordered the philosopher to be seized and burned for making insane and lying accusations. 6 Such was the penalty that the beggar paid for his ill-timed outspokenness. The emperor's intimate friends, however, who had long been secretly hostile to <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> (for the prefect was harsh and unbearable in his insolence and arrogance), believed that the time had come and began to bring charges against him. As a result, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> escaped the plot, and <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> and his sons perished miserably. 7 For not much later, some soldiers visited <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a>' son in secret and carried off coins bearing the prefect's portrait. And, without the knowledge of <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a>, the praetorian prefect, they took the coins directly to <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> and revealed to him the secret details of the plot. They were richly rewarded for their service. 8 While <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> was still ignorant of these developments and anticipated nothing of the sort, the emperor sent for him at night and had him beheaded. And he dispatched men to <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a>' son by the fastest route, so that they might reach him before he knew what had happened. These men were to take a route shorter than the one by which news was regularly carried; in this way they would be able to come to the youth before he was aware of events at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> wrote the youth a friendly letter, telling him that he was recalling him to greater expectations, and ordering him to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 9 <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a>' son knew nothing of the reception awaiting him and was unaware of his father's fate. When the messengers informed him that his father had given these same orders orally but, satisfied with the emperor's letter, had not written a separate note, the youth was convinced, although he was concerned about leaving the plot unfinished. Nevertheless, relying on his father's power as if that power still existed, he left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>. 10 On the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> the youth was killed by the emperor's men. Such was the fate of <a href=/people/11057 target=_blank>Perennis</a> and his son. Thereafter <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> regularly appointed two praetorian prefects, believing that it was safer not to place too much authority in the hands of one man; he hoped that this division of authority would discourage any desire to seize the imperial power. </p>                        </div>

It involved a former soldier named Maternus, who had committed many frightful crimes. He deserted from the army, persuading others to flee with him, and soon collected a huge mob of desperadoes. At first they attacked and plundered villages and farms, but when Maternus had amassed a sizable sum of money, he gathered an even larger band of cutthroats by offering the prospect of generous booty and a fair share of the loot. As a result, his men no longer appeared to be brigands but rather enemy troops. 2 They now attacked the largest cities and released all the prisoners, no matter what the reasons for their imprisonment. By promising these men their freedom, he persuaded them to join his band in gratitude for favors received. The bandits roamed over all Gaul and Spain, attacking the largest cities; a few of these they burned, but the rest they abandoned after sacking them. 3 When he was informed of these developments, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, in a towering rage, sent threatening dispatches to the governors of the provinces involved, charging them with negligence and ordering them to raise an army to oppose the bandits. When the brigands learned that an army was being raised against them, they left the regions which they had been ravaging and slipped unnoticed, a few at a time, into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, by a quick but difficult route. And now Maternus was plotting for the empire, for larger stakes indeed. Since everything he had attempted had succeeded beyond his fondest hopes, he concluded that if he were to undertake something really important it was bound to succeed; having committed himself to a hazard from which it was impossible to withdraw, he would, at least, not die obscure and unknown. 4 But when he reflected that he did not have an army sufficiently powerful to resist <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> on equal terms and in open opposition (for it was thought that the majority of the Roman people were still well disposed toward <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, and he also had the support of the Praetorian Guard), Maternus hoped to balance this inequality of forces by guile and cunning. This is the way he undertook to accomplish it. 5 Every year, on a set day at the beginning of spring, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> celebrate a festival in honor of the <a href=/people/11088 target=_blank>Mother of the Gods</a>. All the valuable trappings of each deity, the imperial treasures, and marvelous objects of all kinds, both natural and man-made, are carried in procession before this goddess. Free license for every kind of revelry is granted, and each man assumes the disguise of his choice. No office is so important or so sacrosanct that permission is refused anyone to put on its distinctive uniform and join in the revelry, concealing his true identity; consequently, it is not easy to distinguish the true from the false. 6 This seemed to Maternus an ideal time to launch his plot undetected. By donning the uniform of a praetorian soldier and outfitting his companions in the same way, he hoped to mingle with the true praetorians and, after watching part of the parade, to attack <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> and kill him while no one was on guard. 7 But the plan was betrayed when some of those who had accompanied him into the city revealed the plot. (<a href=/people/4267 target=_blank>Jealousy</a> led them to disclose it, since they preferred to be ruled by the emperor rather than by a bandit chief.) Before he arrived at the scene of the festivities, Maternus was seized and beheaded, and his companions suffered the punishment they deserved. After sacrificing to the goddess and making thank offerings, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> completed the festivities and did honor to the goddess, rejoicing at his escape. The people continued to celebrate their emperor's deliverance after the festival came to an end. </p>                        </div>

They say that this statue of the goddess fell from the sky; the exact material of the statue is not known, nor the identity of the artists who made it; in fact, it is not certain that the statue was the work of human hands. Long ago it fell from the sky in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> (the name of the region where it fell is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393316SPes class=place long=31.5832 lat=39.3314>Pessinus</a>, which received its name from the fall of the heavenly statue); the statue was discovered there. 2 As we learn from other sources, a battle is said to have taken place there between <a href=/people/995 target=_blank>Ilus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> and <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=person long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a>. Some say it was a boundary dispute; others, that it was concerned with <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a>'s kidnapping. The battle continued for a long time on even terms, and a large number of men fell on both sides; this disaster gave the region its name. It was there, so the story goes, that <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymede</a> was spirited away and disappeared from mortals' view when his brother and lover tore him limb from limb. After the youth's body vanished, his sufferings made him immortal when <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> spirited him away to heaven. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> of old staged their revels in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393316SPes class=place long=31.5832 lat=39.3314>Pessinus</a>, on the banks of the river <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, from which the eunuch priests of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> derive their name. 3 When Roman affairs prospered, they say that an oracle prophesied that the empire would endure and soar to greater heights if the goddess were brought from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393316SPes class=place long=31.5832 lat=39.3314>Pessinus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> therefore sent an embassy to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> and asked for the statue; they easily got it by reminding the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> of their kinship and by recalling to them that <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> was the ancestor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>.

The priestess, who was about to be put to death, begged the people to submit her case to the goddess from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393316SPes class=place long=31.5832 lat=39.3314>Pessinus</a>. She unfastened the sash at her waist and attached it to the prow of the ship, praying that if she were still virgin and pure the ship would follow her. 5 The ship, secured to her sash, followed her readily. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were struck with awe both by the manifestation of the goddess and by the piety of the maiden.

Because of his wealth and wantonness, <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> coveted the empire. 4 He bought up most of the grain supply and put it in storage; he hoped in this way to get control of the people and the army by making a generous distribution of grain at the first sign of a food shortage, anticipating that he would win the support of the people when they were suffering from a scarcity of food. He also built a huge gymnasium and public bath and turned them over to the people.

Suddenly, unlooked for by the assembled mob, the imperial cavalry appeared fully armed and, at the order of the prefect, butchered those in their path. 7 The people were unable to withstand the assault, for they were unarmed men on foot fighting against armed men on horseback.

Finally the emperor's eldest sister (her name was Phadilla) rushed into the palace (as his sister, she had free and easy access to the emperor), and, loosing her hair, threw herself down and cried out in anguish: 2 Here you are, emperor, taking your leisure, ignorant of what is happening, when you are actually in the gravest danger. And we, your own flesh and blood, are at this very moment threatened with murder. Already the Roman people and most of the army are lost to you. What we would not think of enduring at the hands of barbarians, our own people are doing to us. And those people whom you have treated with special consideration, you now find to be your enemies. 3 <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> has armed the people and the soldiers against you. Those who hate him because they hold differing opinions, the mob, and the entire imperial cavalry, who support him, are up in arms, killing each other and choking the city with blood. The fury of both factions will fall upon us unless you immediately hand over to them for execution this scoundrelly servant of yours, who already has been the cause of so much destruction for the people and who threatens to be the cause of so much destruction for us. 4 After she had made these statements, tearing her clothes in grief, others who were present (for they became bolder at the words of the emperor's sister) urged <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> to take action. He was terrified by this pressing danger, which did not merely threaten but was already upon him. In his panic he sent for <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a>, who knew nothing of what had been reported to the emperor, but had his suspicions. When the prefect appeared, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> ordered him seized and beheaded, and, impaling his head on a long spear, sent it out to the mob, to whom it was a welcome and long-desired sight. 5 In this way he terminated the danger, and both sides stopped fighting: the soldiers, because they saw that the man for whom they had been fighting had been killed and also because they feared the wrath of the emperor (for they realized that he had been deceived and that <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> had done everything without imperial approval); the people, because their desire for vengeance was satisfied by the arrest of the man responsible for the appalling crimes. 6 They put <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a>'s children to death (for he had two sons), and killed all his known friends. They dragged their bodies through the streets, subjecting them to every indignity, and finally brought the mutilated corpses to the sewer and threw them in. Such was the fate of <a href=/people/857 target=_blank>Cleander</a> and his associates; it was as if Nature had undertaken to demonstrate that a small and unexpected twist of fate can raise a man from the lowest depths to the greatest heights and then plunge the man so exalted down to the depths again. </p>                        </div>

Now the emperor, casting aside all restraint, took part in the public shows, promising to kill with his own hands wild animals of all kinds and to fight in gladiatorial combat against the bravest of the youths. When this news became known, people hastened to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from all over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and from the neighboring provinces to see what they had neither seen nor even heard of before. Special mention was made of the skill of his hands and the fact that he never missed when hurling javelins or shooting arrows. 2 His instructors were the most skillful of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> bowmen and the most accurate of the Maurousian javelin men, but he surpassed them all in marksmanship. When the days for the show arrived, the amphitheater was completely filled. A terrace encircling the arena had been constructed for <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, enabling him to avoid risking his life by fighting the animals at close quarters; rather, by hurling his javelins down from a safe place, he offered a display of skill rather than of courage. 3 Deer, roebuck, and horned animals of all kinds, except <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, he struck down, running with them in pursuit, anticipating their dashes, and killing them with deadly blows. Lions, leopards, and other animals of the nobler sort he killed from above, running around on his terrace. And on no occasion did anyone see a second javelin used, nor any wound except the death wound. 4 For at the very moment the animal started up, it received the blow on its forehead or in its heart, and it bore no other wound, nor did the javelin pierce any other part of its body: the beast was wounded and killed in the same instant. Animals were collected for him from all over the world. Then we saw in the flesh animals that we had previously marveled at in paintings. 5 From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, from lands to the north and to the south, any animals hitherto unknown he displayed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> and then dispatched them. On one occasion he shot arrows with crescent-shaped heads at Maurousian ostriches, birds that move with great speed, both because of their swiftness afoot and the sail-like nature of their wings. He cut off their heads at the very top of the neck; so, after their heads had been severed by the edge of the arrow, they continued to run around as if they had not been injured. 6 Once when a leopard, with a lightning dash, seized a condemned criminal, he thwarted the leopard with his javelin as it was about to close its jaws; he killed the beast and rescued the man, the point of the javelin anticipating the points of the leopard's teeth. Again, when a hundred <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> appeared in one group as if from beneath the earth, he killed the entire hundred with exactly one hundred javelins, and all the bodies lay stretched out in a straight line for some distance; they could thus be counted with no difficulty, and no one saw a single extra javelin. </p>                        </div>

But there was in the palace a very young little boy, one of those who went about bare of clothes but adorned with gold and costly gems. The Roman voluptuaries always took delight in these lads. <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was very fond of this child and often slept with him; his name, Philocommodus, clearly indicates the emperor's affection for him. 4 Philocommodus was playing idly about the palace. After <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had gone out to his usual baths and drinking bouts, the lad wandered into the emperor's bedroom, as he usually did; picking up the tablet for a plaything, he left the bedroom. By a stroke of fate, he met <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a>. After hugging and kissing him (for she too was fond of the child), she took the tablet from him, afraid that in his heedless play he might accidentally erase something important. When she recognized the emperor's handwriting, she was eager to read the tablet. 5 Discovering that it was a death list and that she was scheduled to die first, followed by <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> and Eclectus and many others marked for murder, she cried out in grief and then said to herself: So, <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, this is my reward for my love and devotion, after I have put up with your arrogance and your madness for so many years. But, you drunken sot, you shall not outwit a woman deadly sober! 6 She then summoned Eclectus; he was in the habit of visiting her anyway, since he was the bedroom steward, and it was rumored that she was sleeping with him. She handed him the tablet, saying: See what a party we are to enjoy tonight! Eclectus read it and was dumfounded (but he was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, bold by nature and quick-tempered, a man of action). Sealing the tablet, he sent it off to <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> by one of his trusted slaves. 7 After reading the tablet, <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> hurried to <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> as if to discuss the emperor's orders with her, especially about his proposed stay with the gladiators. And while they pretended to be arguing about this matter, they concluded that they must act first or suffer the consequences, agreeing that it was no time for indecision or delay. 8 They decided to poison <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, and <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> assured them that she could administer a potion with the greatest ease. For it was her custom to mix the wine and give the emperor his first cup, so that he might have a pleasant drink from the hand of his beloved. When <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> returned from his bath, she poured the poison into the cup, mixed it with a pungent wine, and gave it to him to drink. Since it was his practice to take a cup of friendship after his many baths and jousts with animals, he drained it without noticing anything unusual. 9 Immediately he became drowsy and stupefied and fell asleep, believing that it was the natural result of his exertions. Eclectus and <a href=/people/2633 target=_blank>Marcia</a> ordered all the rest to return to their homes, and made everything quiet for him. <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had acted like this on other occasions when overcome by wine. Since he bathed often and drank often, he had no set time for sleeping; in addition, he indulged in all kinds of pleasures, to which he was a willing slave at any hour. 10 For a short time he lay quiet, but, when the poison spread through his stomach and bowels, he became nauseated and began to vomit violently, either because his excessive eating and drinking were expelling the poison, or because he had taken beforehand an antidote for poison, as emperors regularly did before eating or drinking. 11 After much vomiting had occurred, the conspirators, afraid that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> would get rid of the poison, recover, and kill them, promised lavish rewards to a powerful young nobleman, <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a>, if he would strangle the emperor. <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a> rushed in where the emperor lay overcome by the poisoned wine, seized him by the throat, and finished him off. 12 Such was the fate <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> suffered, after ruling for thirteen years from the date of his father's death. He was the most nobly born of all the emperors who preceded him and was the handsomest man of his time, both in beauty of features and in physical development. If it were fitting to discuss his manly qualities, he was inferior to no man in skill and in marksmanship, if only he had not disgraced these excellent traits by shameful practices. </p>                        </div>

Yet even in this extremity, they say, he remained so serene that he did not get up, but received them lying in bed. Even though he believed that <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> had come with Eclectus to kill him, he spoke to them calmly, with no sign of pallor. 7 For a long time now, he said, I have been waiting for my life to end in this fashion, and I was surprised that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was so slow to act against me, the sole survivor of the advisers his father appointed for him. Why do you delay? You will be carrying out your orders, and I will be relieved from degrading hope and constant fear. 8 To this <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> replied: Please stop saying things unworthy of you and your past conduct. Our visit does not concern your death but our safety and the safety of the Roman empire. The tyrant is dead, victim of a fate he richly deserved. What he planned to do to us, we have done to him. 9 We have come to place the empire in your hands, aware that you are not only the most distinguished senator, because of your moderate life, and have won reverence for your greatness and the dignity of your years, but you also enjoy the love and esteem of the people. All these reasons lead us to believe that what we are doing will please the people and save our own lives. 10 <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> said in reply: Why do you mock an old man ? Why do you judge me such a coward that you wish first to taunt and then to kill me?

The emperor was little concerned about his own safety (he had many times scorned much greater dangers), but he was worried about this abrupt change from the autocracy of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> and about the noble ancestry of certain of the senators. He suspected that these senators, after having been ruled by the most nobly born of all the emperors, would not be willing to let the reins of government fall into the hands of a man who came to the high office from humble and undistinguished antecedents. 2 Even if his life deserved admiration for its restraint, and even if his military exploits were famous, in nobility of birth he was much inferior to the aristocracy.

But when the initial favor is virtually unsurpassable, if the recipient does not return one equally large, the fact that this is a difficult matter is never taken into consideration; it is thought to be merely evidence of his ingratitude and lack of appreciation. 7 I see, therefore, that no ordinary task awaits me in proving myself worthy of such an honor as you have bestowed upon me. But the honor of the throne lies not in the throne itself, but in the acts which he who holds it must perform if he is not to disgrace his high office. The more men hate an unpleasant past, the more hopefully they look forward to a pleasant future. Injuries are remembered forever (the memory of pain is difficult to erase), but benefits and the memory of benefits disappear when the enjoyment of them is gone. </p>                        </div>

But the man who is deprived of his property never forgets the man responsible for his loss. And if any change takes place for the common good, no one thinks that he has derived from it any personal benefit, since, when the common good prospers, it is of little concern to the whole group as individuals. With respect to his own affairs, no one believes that anything is of value to him unless he happens to obtain something he personally desires. 9 But those who have grown accustomed to reveling in the extravagant excesses of a tyranny not only object to any change toward a more moderate and more economical way of life occasioned by a shortage of money, not terming it sensible economy or planned and judicious management, but they reject it as a mean and wretched way to live, oblivious to the fact that had it not been for the loot taken by pillage and plunder, they could never have enjoyed their luxurious way of life. On the other hand, to give to every man all things according to his worth and for logical reasons, without committing any injustices, and not to supply him with an abundance of money gained from illegal sources teaches prudent conservation of things supplied in quantity. 10 And so you, who are skilled in these matters, must cooperate with me and consider the management of the empire as a joint enterprise, and you must entertain high hopes of living under an aristocracy, not under a tyranny, and you must confirm this for all our subjects. </p>                        </div>

Longing for a return to the violence and looting of the preceding tyranny and to their extravagant and dissolute pursuits, they plotted to remove <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> on the ground that he was a burden and a nuisance to them, and to choose an emperor who would restore to them their unbridled and uncontrolled power. 2 And so, with no warning, the praetorians rushed headlong from their camp one day at noon, when they were off duty. Wild with unreasoning anger, they burst into the palace with spears raised and swords drawn. 3 The imperial attendants on duty in the palace were astounded at this unbelievable and unexpected assault. Since they were only a handful of unarmed men against a horde of armed soldiers, the attendants deserted their assigned posts and fled into the palace grounds or the nearby passageways. But a few who were devoted to <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> informed him of the attack and advised him to flee and put his hope of safety in the people. 4 The emperor, however, did not follow the advice of those who suggested this advantageous course of action in the present emergency; he considered this solution undignified and servile, unworthy of an emperor and unworthy of his previous way of life and his achievements. He therefore declined to flee or to hide; preferring to face the issue squarely, he came out to talk to the praetorians, hoping to win them over and put an end to their insane anger. 5 And so he left the room and approached the praetorians, in an effort to discover the reason for their anger, and tried to persuade them not to act like madmen.

Men of position went out to their estates which were farthest from the city, to avoid the danger of being present at the selection of the new emperor. 4 When the praetorians saw that the people were quiet and that no one dared to avenge the murder of the emperor, they remained isolated inside the camp. Then, bringing forward to the walls the men with the loudest voices, they made proclamation that the empire was for sale, promising to hand it over to the man who offered the highest price, and promising to conduct the purchaser safely to the imperial palace under the protection of their arms. 5 When they made this proclamation, the more august and respected senators, those who were nobly born and still wealthy, the scattered survivors of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>' tyranny, did not go to the wall; they had no desire to use their wealth basely and shamefully to buy the empire. 6 But the praetorians' proposition was reported to a man named <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> while he was giving a dinner in the late afternoon amid much drinking and carousing. This <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> had already served a term as consul and was thought to be a very wealthy man; he was one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> censured for an intemperate way of life. 7 Then his wife and daughter and a mob of parasites persuaded him to leave his dining couch and hurry to the wall of the camp to find out what was going on. All the way to the camp they urged him to seize the prostrate empire; he had plenty of money and could outbid anyone who opposed him. 8 And so, when they came to the wall, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> shouted up a promise to give the praetorians everything they wanted, assuring them that he had plenty of money, that his strongboxes were crammed with gold and silver. At the same moment the urban prefect Sulpicianus, a man of consular rank (he was the father of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>' wife), came to bargain for the empire. 9 But the praetorians refused to accept this man, afraid of his kinship with <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, and fearing too that this might be a trick to avenge the emperor's murder. Lowering a ladder, they brought <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> up to the top of the wall, for they were unwilling to open the gates until they knew how much he would pay for the empire. 10 When he came up, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> promised to revive the memory of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, to restore his honors, and to re-erect his statues which the senate had pulled down; he further promised to restore to the praetorians all the powers they had possessed under that emperor and to give each soldier more gold than he asked for or expected to receive. 11 Convinced by his promises and delighted with their expectations, the guard proclaimed <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> emperor, and, in view of his family and his ancestry, thought it appropriate that he assume the name of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>. Then, raising their standards, to which pictures of <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> had been attached, they prepared to escort the emperor to the imperial palace. 12 After he had performed the usual imperial sacrifices in the camp, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> was led out under the protection of a contingent of the guard larger than normal. Because he had purchased the empire shamefully, disgracefully, and fraudulently, using force and opposing the wishes of the people, the new emperor rightly feared that the people would be hostile toward him. 13 Therefore, under full arms and armor, the praetorians formed a phalanx so that, if necessary, they could fight. They placed their chosen emperor in the center of the formation, holding their spears and shields over their heads to protect the procession from any shower of stones hurled down from the houses. In this fashion they succeeded in conducting <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> to the palace, as none of the people dared oppose them. No one, however, shouted the congratulations usually heard when emperors were accompanied by a formal escort; on the contrary, the people stood at a distance, shouting curses and reviling <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> bitterly for using his wealth to purchase the empire. </p>                        </div>

Accustomed to a rugged life, he was physically able to endure heavy labor; mentally, he was quick to understand and quick to act once he understood. 3 When he learned from reports that the Roman empire was dangling in the sky like a meteor for <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> and <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> to seize, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, charging the former with negligence and the latter with cowardice, decided to intervene in these affairs. He had had dreams which led him to expect something like this, and his dreams were supported by oracular responses and all the signs that appear as prophecies of things to come. All these, whether they are true or false, are invariably believed when they foretell something which later actually occurs. 4 <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> himself recorded many portents in his autobiography, and had them inscribed on his public statues also. But the last and most significant of his dreams, the one which made it clear to him that he would get all he hoped for, must not be omitted. 5 At the time <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> was reported to have assumed control of the empire, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, after making the sacrifices and swearing the oath of allegiance to the new emperor, went back to his house at dusk and fell asleep. He dreamed that he saw a large, noble stallion adorned with the imperial trappings carrying <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> down the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XIer class=place long=23.682 lat=37.992>Sacred Way</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 6 But when the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> arrived at the entrance of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, where, in the old days of the Republic, the popular assemblies had been held, in his dream the stallion unseated <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> and threw him to the ground. While <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> stood there motionless, the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> slipped under him, taking him up on his back, and bore him safely along. Then, halting in the middle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, the stallion raised <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> aloft, so that he was seen and cheered by all. And in our time a huge bronze statue depicting this dream still stood on that spot. 7 His resolve thus strengthened, with high hopes that he was being called to the throne by divine summons, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> made trial of the attitude of the soldiers. As the first step, he met in his quarters with a few commanders and tribunes and prominent soldiers and discussed with them the Roman empire, how it lay completely helpless because there was no man of the nobility and no man with enough ability to take control of it. 8 He spoke with contempt of the praetorians at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> as disloyal and false to their oath in spilling the blood of their emperor and fellow Roman, and told them that he had to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to avenge the murder of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, for he was aware that all the soldiers in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> remembered the governorship of the man. 9 When Marcus was emperor, <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> had won with them many victories over the Germans; after he had been appointed general and governor of the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, he had displayed great courage in fighting the enemy. But at the same time he revealed his benevolence and good will toward those he ruled by his moderation and his sensible exercise of authority. For these reasons they revered his memory and were enraged at those who had treated him so savagely. 10 Seizing this as his excuse, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> without difficulty persuaded them to do what he wished; he pretended that he was not personally seeking the empire and did not desire power for himself, but rather that he wished to avenge the murder of so great an emperor as <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>. 11 Although the men of those regions have huge and powerful bodies and are skillful and murderous in battle, they are dull of wit and slow to realize that they are being deceived. Hence they believed <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> when he said that he was enraged and wished to avenge the murder of <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>; and, putting themselves in his hands, they made him emperor and turned the control of the empire over to him. 12 Since he now knew the attitude of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=ethnic long=19 lat=45>Pannonians</a>, he reported these events to the neighboring provinces and to the rulers of all the northern nations under Roman control; he convinced them by lavish promises and the expectation of great rewards, and easily won their support. 13 He was surely the most accomplished of all men in pretending to pledge his good will, but he never kept his sworn word if it proved necessary for him to break it; he lied whenever it was advantageous to him, and his tongue said many things which his heart did not mean. </p>                        </div>

And now, because you ask it, although I never before entertained such a hope (you know my loyalty to the emperors), it is my duty to undertake and successively resolve these matters which have your approval. 3 I must not allow the Roman empire to lie helpless, that empire which, to the end of Marcus' reign, was administered with reverence and appeared to be august and awesome. Under <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a>, however, the empire underwent a change, and yet, even if it did suffer somewhat at his hands because of his youth, all was forgiven him because of his noble birth and the memory of his father. And the truth is that there was more reason to pity than to despise him for his errors, in that we attributed most of what happened not to him personally but to the parasites who swarmed around him and to his advisers and accomplices in his irregular acts. 4 But when the empire came into the hands of that revered elder statesman <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, the memory of whose courage and service to the state is still firmly fixed in our hearts, the praetorians not only did not protect their emperor, but went so far as to murder that illustrious man. And now some fellow has disgracefully purchased the empire and its vast expanse of land and sea; as you have heard, he is hated by the people and no longer trusted by the disillusioned praetorians. 5 Even if they loved him and intended to support him, you outnumber them and are superior in courage. You have trained under actual combat conditions in your continuous skirmishes with the barbarians, and you are accustomed to endure all kinds of labor. Ignoring heat and cold, you cross frozen rivers on the ice; you do not drink water from wells, but water you have dug yourself. You have also trained by fighting with animals, and, all in all, you have won so distinguished a reputation for bravery that no one could stand against you. 6 <a href=/people/3943 target=_blank>Toil</a> is the true test of the soldier, not easy living, and those luxury-loving sots would not face your battle cry, much less your battle line. But if any one of you is concerned about affairs in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, he may judge how feeble the effort is there and how slight the hope of success by the fact that these men have not dared to venture beyond their own borders and were not bold enough to plan for a journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. There they remain, content, believing that this temporary taste of living in luxury represents the total profit to them of this firmly established empire. 7 The truth is that the Syrians are suited only to games and childish banter. This is especially true of those who live in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, who are reported to be highly enthusiastic supporters of <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>. But the rest of the provinces and cities have up to now found no one worthy of the imperial throne, and, because no man has appeared who will rule with courage and use sound administrative practices, it is evident that they are only pretending to support that fellow. 8 But if they should learn that the army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> has already made its choice, and if they should hear our name, which is not unknown or without honor among them, because of our term as governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, know well, I say, that they will not find fault with me for delay or cowardice, nor will they elect to stand and face your bravery and your battle prowess, for they are greatly inferior to you in size of body, in endurance of hardship, and in close-quarter combat. </p>                        </div>

Still, he collected his own money and that of his friends, appropriated what was left in the public and temple treasuries, and undertook to distribute this sum among the praetorians in an effort to purchase their good will. 8 But in spite of the fact that they received large amounts of money, the praetorians were in no way grateful to the emperor; they felt that he was not giving them a bonus but only paying them what he owed them. <br />Although his friends advised him to lead out the army and seize the passes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>, <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> did nothing.

When the people learned of these developments, they were in complete confusion; fearing the army of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, they pretended to support his cause, charging <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> with cowardice and <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> with hesitation and sloth.

Ordering the senate to convene, he sent a letter to <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> in which he proposed peace and, proclaiming him emperor, made him his colleague in governing the empire. The senate voted its approval of these proposals; but when it was obvious that <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> was terror-stricken and in despair, all the senators immediately abandoned him for <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>. 4 After two or three days had passed, the senators, aware that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, contemptuous of <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, entered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> at the order of the consuls, the officials who took charge at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when the affairs of the empire were in confusion. 5 After convening, the senate consulted about what should be done in the present emergency.

Prior orders had been issued to <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' soldiers to surround the praetorians, now their enemy, at the moment when they were standing with their eyes fixed in expectant attention upon the emperor; they were not, however, to wound or strike any member of the guard. <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> ordered his troops to hold the praetorians in a tight ring of steel, believing that they would not resist, since they were only a few unarmed men, fearful of wounds, confronted by an armed host. 5 When he had them netted like fish in his circle of weapons, like prisoners of war, the enraged emperor shouted in a loud voice: <br />You see by what has happened that we are superior to you in intelligence, in size of army, and in number of supporters. Surely you were easily trapped, captured without a struggle. It is in my power to do with you what I wish when I wish. Helpless and prostrate, you lie before us now, victims of our might. 6 But if one looks for a punishment equal to the crimes you have committed, it is impossible to find a suitable one.

The empire of the Roman people, eternally respected, which our forefathers obtained by their valiant courage or inherited because of their noble birth, this empire you shamefully and disgracefully sold for silver as if it were your personal property. 7 But you were unable to defend the man whom you yourselves had chosen as emperor. No, you betrayed him like the cowards you are. For these monstrous acts and crimes you deserve a thousand deaths, if one wished to do to you what you have earned.

He put off these projects until later, however, wishing to seize the Roman empire first and make it secure for himself and his sons. 2 Even though <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> had been eliminated, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> considered <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> still a menace. He now heard that this man, delighted with the title of Caesar, was acting more and more like an emperor; he was informed also that a great many men, particularly the most distinguished senators, were writing public and private letters to the Caesar, trying to persuade him to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> while <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was absent and occupied elsewhere. The fact is that the aristocracy much preferred <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> as emperor because he belonged to a noble family and was reputed to have a mild nature. 3 When he learned of these developments, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> declined to initiate open hostility against <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> and start a war with him since he lacked a reasonable excuse for such action. He thought it best to try to eliminate his Caesar by tricking him without warning. 4 He therefore sent his most trusted imperial messengers to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> with secret orders to hand <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> the dispatches openly if they were admitted to his presence. They were then to ask him to meet them privately to receive secret instructions; when <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> agreed to this and his bodyguards were not present, the messengers were to attack him without warning and cut him down. 5 <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> provided them with deadly poisons so that, if the opportunity presented itself, they might persuade one of his cooks or cupbearers to administer a dose in secret. 6 <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' advisers, however, were suspicious of the emperor's messengers, and warned him to be on his guard against this cunning schemer. <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' actions against <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>'s governors had seriously damaged his reputation; after forcing them through their children to betray <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, as has been related above, and after making good use of their assistance, he put them to death with their children after he had got from them everything he wanted. His actions on this occasion clearly revealed <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' despicable character. 7 The efforts of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> now led <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> to increase the size of his bodyguard. None of the emperor's men was admitted into the Caesar's presence until he had first been stripped and searched for concealed weapons. 8 Now when the messengers from <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> arrived, they handed over the dispatches to <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> openly and asked him to retire with them to receive secret orders. But <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, suspicious, had the men seized, and, putting them to torture privately, discovered the entire plot; after killing the messengers, he prepared to resist his revealed enemy. </p>                        </div>

Calling together the entire army, he spoke to them as follows: <br />Let no one charge us with capricious inconsistency in our actions against <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, and let no one think that I am disloyal to this alleged friend or lacking in feeling toward him. 2 We gave this man everything, even a share of the established empire, a thing which a man would hardly do for his own brother. Indeed, I bestowed upon him that which you entrusted to me alone. Surely <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> has shown little gratitude for the many benefits I have lavished upon him. 3 Now he is collecting an army to take up arms against us, scornful of your valor and indifferent to his pledge of good faith to me, wishing in his insatiable greed to seize at the risk of disaster that which he has already received in part without war and without bloodshed, showing no respect for the gods by whom he has often sworn, and counting as worthless the labors you performed on our joint behalf with such courage and devotion to duty. 4 In what you accomplished, he also had a share, and he would have had an even greater share of the honor you gained for us both if he had only kept his word. For, just as it is unfair to initiate wrong actions, so also it is cowardly to make no defense against unjust treatment. Now when we took the field against <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a>, we had reasons for our hostility, not entirely logical, perhaps, but inevitable. We did not hate him because he had seized the empire after it was already ours, but rather each one of us, motivated by an equal desire for glory, sought the empire for himself alone, when it was still in dispute and lay prostrate before all. 5 But <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> has violated his pledges and broken his oaths, and although he received from me that which a man normally gives only to his son, he has chosen to be hostile rather than friendly and belligerent instead of peaceful. And just as we were generous to him previously and showered fame and honor upon him, so let us now punish him with our arms for his treachery and cowardice. 6 His army, small and island-bred, will not stand against your might. For you, who by your valor and readiness to act on your own behalf have been victorious in many battles and have gained control of the entire East, how can you fail to emerge victorious with the greatest of ease when you have so large a number of allies and when virtually the entire army is here. Whereas they, by contrast, are few in number and lack a brave and competent general to lead them. 7 Who does not know <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' effeminate nature? Who does not know that his way of life has prepared him more for the chorus than for the battlefield? Let us therefore go forth against him with confidence, relying on our customary zeal and valor, with the gods as our allies, gods against whom he has acted impiously in breaking his oaths, and let us be mindful of the victories we have won, victories which that man ridicules. </p>                        </div>

After making generous gifts to the soldiers, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> publicly announced his expedition against <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>. 9 He also sent troops to continue the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, which was still under blockade because the soldiers of <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> had fled there.

Often when he was journeying through very high and very cold mountains, the emperor strode along bareheaded through rain and snow, setting an example of courage and constancy for his soldiers, who endured hardships not only from fear and from training but also in imitation of their emperor. <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> sent a general ahead with a unit of soldiers to seize the passes of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and guard the approaches to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. </p>                        </div>

Crossing over to the mainland of Gaul opposite <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, he established his headquarters there. He then sent messages to the governors of the provinces ordering them to provide food and money for his army. Some obeyed and sent supplies, to their own destruction, since they suffered for it later; those who did not obey him saved themselves, more by luck than good judgment. The outcome of the affair and the fortunes of war determined the wisdom of each decision. 2 When the army of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> came to Gaul, a few minor skirmishes occurred here and there, but the final battle was fought near the large and prosperous city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lugdunum</a>. <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> shut himself up in that city, remaining behind when he sent the army out to do battle. A major engagement developed, and for a long time each side's chances of victory were equal, for in courage and ruthlessness the soldiers from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> were in no way inferior to the soldiers from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyria</a>. When these two magnificent armies were locked in combat, it was no easy matter to put either one to flight. 3 As some contemporary historians recorded — saying it not to curry favor but in the interests of accuracy — the division of the army stationed opposite the sector where <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and his command were fighting proved far superior; the emperor slipped from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and fled, managing to escape by throwing off the imperial cloak. But while the soldiers from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> were pursuing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, chanting paeans of praise as if they were already victorious, they say that <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a>, one of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' generals, appeared with the troops under his command fresh and not yet committed in the battle. 4 The historians accuse <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> of watching the progress of the battle and deliberately waiting, holding his troops out of the fighting and appearing only after he was informed that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> had been beaten. The aftermath of the affair substantiates the charge that <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> coveted the empire himself. Later, when <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> had set everything straight and was living an orderly life, he gave generous rewards to the rest of his commanders, but <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> alone he put to death, as seems reasonable under the circumstances, considering the general's past performances. 5 All this happened at a much later date, however. On this occasion, when <a href=/people/11054 target=_blank>Laetus</a> appeared with fresh troops, as has been related above, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' soldiers, taking heart, wrapped the emperor in the imperial cloak again and mounted him on his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. 6 But <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' soldiers, thinking that the victory was theirs, now found themselves in disorder when this powerful and as yet uncommitted army suddenly attacked; after a brief resistance they broke and ran. When the rout became general, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' soldiers pursued and slaughtered the fugitives until they drove them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lugdunum</a>. Each contemporary historian has recorded to suit his own purpose the actual number of those killed and captured on each side. 7 The emperor's troops captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lugdunum</a> and burned it. When they caught <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> they cut off his head and sent it to <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> [A.D. 197]. The emperor thus won two magnificent victories, one in the East and one in the West. No battles and no victories can be compared to those of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, and no army to the size of his army; there are no comparable uprisings among nations, or total number of campaigns, or length and speed of marches. </p>                        </div>

His subjects submitted from fear rather than affection. 9 He did try, however, to do what would please the people; he staged costly spectacles of every kind, killing on numerous occasions hundreds of animals of every species collected from all parts of the empire and from foreign lands as well, in connection with which he distributed lavish gifts. He held triumphal games for which he summoned dramatic actors and skilled athletes from every quarter. 10 In his reign we saw every kind of show exhibited in all the theaters simultaneously, as well as night-long revels celebrated in imitation of the Mysteries. The people of that day called them the Secular Games when they learned that they would be held only once every hundred years. Heralds were sent throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> bidding all to come and see what they had never seen before and would never see again. It was thus made clear that the amount of time which elapsed between one celebration of the Secular Games and the next far exceeded the total span of any man's life.4 </p>                        </div>

The prefect was the only official whose appearance suggested his importance. 3 He was an object of dread when he appeared in public; not only did no one approach him, but even those who came upon him by chance turned aside to avoid him.

The choice is yours either to become what you now see me to be and to secure this office of authority by succeeding me, or to die here and now, paying the penalty for disobedience. 6 Do not by any means be overawed by the enormity of the deed I propose, and do not be disturbed by the title of emperor. You are the only one who can go into the room where the emperor and his son are sleeping, since you are in charge of the regular rounds of the night unit of the guard. Whatever you intend to do, you will do secretly and without interference; do not wait for me to issue the orders before you obey them. 7 Go immediately to the imperial palace and, pretending to be carrying secret orders from me, go in and kill them. Show your courage by dispatching with ease an old man and a mere boy. And for sharing the risk and the danger, you will also share the highest honors when the deed is successfully done. </p>                        </div>

The guards reported the matter to <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and were ordered to bring the tribune before him. 2 The tribune approached the emperor and said: I have come to you, Master, as the man who sent me well knows, to be your assassin and murderer, but I hope and pray that I will be instead your benefactor and savior. <a href=/people/10104 target=_blank>Plautianus</a>, scheming to seize the empire, ordered me to murder you and your son, and he issued this order not in words alone but in writing. This memorandum is my witness. I undertook the assignment because I was afraid that if I refused it he would entrust the task to someone else, and I have come here to disclose these matters to you so that his intrigues may not remain undetected. 3 But even though <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> made these charges with much weeping, <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was not immediately convinced. On the contrary, since he had great affection for the prefect, he suspected that the affair was a trick of some sort to deceive him; he believed that his son, in his hatred of the prefect and his daughter, had contrived a slanderous and fatal plot against the man. 4 The emperor therefore sent for his son and reprimanded him for having devised such a scheme against a man kindly disposed toward the emperor and his intimate friend as well. At first <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> swore on his honor that he knew nothing about what the tribune was saying; but when the man insisted and produced the memorandum, the young emperor encouraged him, urging him to prove the truth of his charges. Realizing his danger and fearing the emperor's affection for <a href=/people/10104 target=_blank>Plautianus</a>, the tribune now knew that if the plot remained confused and unproved, he could expect a death that would not be accidental. 5 Master, he said, do you wish stronger proof or clearer evidence of some sort? Then allow me to go to the front of the palace and reveal to one of the men loyal to me that the murder is done. Trusting me, <a href=/people/10104 target=_blank>Plautianus</a> will come here in the belief that he is occupying the deserted palace. When he arrives, it will be your task to discover the truth. Order complete silence about the palace so that the plan may not be upset by being previously discovered. </p>                        </div>

To begin with, public mourning, a combination of festive feeling and religious ceremony, is observed throughout the entire city. 2 After a costly funeral, the body of the emperor is interred in the customary fashion. But then a wax image is fashioned in the exact likeness of the corpse and placed on a large, high couch of ivory draped with coverings embroidered with gold.

None of these women wear gold ornaments or necklaces; each affects the plain white garments associated with mourning. 4 The various ceremonies mentioned above continue for seven days. Every day the physicians come and visit the couch; after pretending to examine the sick man, they announce daily that his condition is growing steadily worse. When it appears that he is dead, the noblest of the Equestrians and picked young senators lift the couch and carry it along the Sacred Way to the Old Forum, where the Roman magistrates give up their authority. 5 Tiers of seats are erected on each side of the couch: on one side sits a chorus of children from the noblest and most distinguished families; on the other, a chorus of women who seem to deserve respect. In honor of the dead man each choral group sings hymns and paeans arranged in solemn and mournful measures. 6 The couch is then carried out of the city to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a>, where, in the widest part of the plain, a square building has been constructed entirely of huge wooden beams in the shape of a house. 7 The whole interior of this building is filled with firewood; and on the outside it is decorated with gold-embroidered hangings, ivory figures, colored paintings. Upon this structure rests a smaller second story, similar in shape and decoration, with open windows and doors. And there is a third and a fourth story, each smaller than the one beneath it; finally, the smallest story of all tops this structure. 8 The building may be compared in shape to the lighthouses along the coast which by the light of their fires bring to safety ships in distress at night. The common name for such a lighthouse is Pharos. They bring the couch to this structure and carry it up to the second story; then they add every kind of perfume and incense the earth provides, together with all the fruits, herbs, and juices that are gathered for their fragrance. 9 Every province, every city, every man of fame and distinction is happy to furnish these last gifts in the emperor's honor. After a huge pile of aromatic material is collected, and the structure is completely filled, a cavalry exhibition is staged around the building; the entire Equestrian cavalry circles around it, following a fixed rotating pattern in the Pyrrhic choruses and maneuvers. 10 Chariots, too, are driven around the building in similar formations by drivers in purple robes; these chariots carry statues whose faces are those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> who fought or ruled in distinguished fashion. When these rites have been completed, the emperor's successor puts a torch to the structure, after which the people set it on fire on all sides. The flames easily and quickly consume the enormous pile of fire-wood and fragrant stuffs. 11 From the topmost and smallest story, as if from a battlement, an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> flies forth, soaring with the flames into the sky; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> believe that this <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> carries the soul of the emperor from the earth up to heaven.

Each of the youths privately solicited their support in secret letters, trying to win them by lavish promises. The majority favored <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, who showed some evidence of a reasonable disposition, since he conducted himself mildly and moderately toward those who visited him, and devoted his time to the more serious pursuits. 3 He studied with men respected for their learning and exercised frequently at the wrestling schools and the various gymnasia.

Since he did everything in anger and used threats instead of persuasion, his friends were bound to him by fear, not by affection. <br />As the brothers were now completely at odds in even the most trivial matters, their mother undertook to effect a reconciliation. 5 And at that time they concluded that it was best to divide the empire, to avoid remaining in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and continuing their intrigues. Summoning the advisers appointed by their father, with their mother present too, they decided to partition the empire: <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> to have all Europe, and <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> all the lands lying opposite Europe, the region known as <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. 6 For, they said, the two continents were separated by the Propontic Gulf as if by divine foresight. It was agreed that <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> establish his headquarters at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, with <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>; the two stations, on opposite sides of the straits, would guard each empire and prevent any crossings at that point.

Of the Southern provinces, the lands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=ethnic long=-5 lat=35>Maurousians</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, and the adjacent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=ethnic long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libyans</a> were given to <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>, and the regions east of these peoples were allotted to <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>. 8 While they were engaged in cleaving the empire, all the rest kept their eyes fixed on the ground, but <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> cried out: <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and sea, my children, you have found a way to divide, and, as you say, the Propontic Gulf separates the continents. But your mother, how would you parcel her? How am I, unhappy, wretched — how am I to be torn and ripped asunder for the pair of you ?

Thus would I, too, together with earth and sea, be partitioned between you. 9 After saying this, amid tears and lamentations, <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> stretched out her hands and, clasping them both in her arms, tried to reconcile them.

If it became necessary to appoint a governor or a magistrate, each wished to select a friend for the post. If they sat as judges, they handed down dissenting opinions, often to the ruin of those on trial; for rivalry counted more than justice to these two. Even at the shows the brothers took opposite sides. 2 They tried every sort of intrigue; each, for example, attempted to persuade the other's cooks and cupbearers to administer some deadly poison. It was not easy for either one to succeed in these attempts, however: both were exceedingly careful and took many precautions. Finally, unable to endure the situation any longer and maddened by the desire for sole power, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> decided to act and advance his cause by sword or slaughter or die in a manner befitting his birth. 3 Since his plotting was unsuccessful, he thought he must try some desperate and dangerous scheme; [so he killed his brother in the arms of their mother, and by this act really killed them both], his mother dying of grief and his brother from treachery. <br />Mortally wounded, <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> died, drenching his mother's breast with his blood. Having succeeded in the murder, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> ran from the room and rushed throughout the palace, shouting that he had escaped grave danger and had barely managed to save his life. 4 He ordered the soldiers who guard the imperial palace to protect him and escort him to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, where he could be safely guarded, saying that if he remained in the imperial palace he would be murdered. Unaware of what had happened inside, the soldiers believed him and ran with him as he dashed ahead at full speed. Consternation seized the people when they saw the emperor speeding on foot through the middle of the city in the early evening. 5 Rushing into the camp and into the temple where the standards and decorations of the guard were worshiped, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> threw himself on the ground; in the chapel, he gave thanks and offered sacrifices for his safety. When this was reported to the praetorians, some of whom were in the baths, while others were already asleep, they hurriedly assembled in amazement. 6 When he appeared before them, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> did not immediately reveal what had happened; instead, shouting that he had escaped the deadly plots of an enemy and rival, he identified his assailant as his brother. He cried out that he had with difficulty emerged victorious, after a severe struggle with his enemies; but when he and his brother had put everything at stake, <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> had chosen him as sole emperor. His motive in thus distorting the facts was his desire to have them hear from him what had happened rather than from someone else. 7 In gratitude for his deliverance and in return for the sole rule, he promised each soldier 2, denarii and increased their ration allowance by one-half. He ordered the praetorians to go immediately and take the money from the temple depositories and the treasuries. In a single day he recklessly distributed all the money which <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> had collected and hoarded from the calamities of others over a period of eighteen years. 8 When they heard about this vast amount of money, although they were aware of what had actually occurred, the murder having been made common knowledge by fugitives from the palace, the praetorians at once proclaimed <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> emperor and called <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> enemy. </p>                        </div>

Censure for cowardice follows when a man succumbs to disaster, but the winner gains, together with his safety, a reputation for courage. 4 As to the rest, all the plots he laid against me, using deadly poisons and every kind of treachery, these you can discover by the use of torture. For this reason I issued orders for <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>'s servants to be present here so that you may learn the truth. Several have already been examined, and the results of the examination are available. In his final act of treachery, <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a> burst in upon me while I was with my mother, accompanied by swordsmen whom he had obtained for this attempt upon my life. 5 But I grasped the situation with great shrewdness and presence of mind and defended myself against an enemy who no longer displayed the attitude or feelings of a brother. Now to defend oneself against plots is not merely proper; it is a standard practice. Indeed, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, the founder of this city, refused to allow his brother to ridicule what he had done. 6 And I pass over without comment <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, brother of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>; <a href=/people/12115 target=_blank>Britannicus</a>, <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s brother; and <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a>, brother of <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>. Even Marcus himself, who professed to love philosophy and excellence, would not tolerate the arrogance of Lucius, his brother-in-law, and by a plot removed him from the scene. So I too, when poisons were prepared for me and a sword hung over me, defended myself against my enemy, for this is the name which describes his actions. 7 First of all, you must give thanks to the gods for having preserved at least one of your emperors for you; then you must lay aside your differences of opinion in thought and in attitude and lead your lives in security, looking to one emperor alone. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, as he is himself sole ruler of the gods, thus gives to one ruler sole charge of mankind.

Each night saw the murder of men in every walk of life. He burned <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal Virgins</a> alive because they were unchaste. Finally, the emperor did something that had never been done before; while he was watching a chariot race, the crowd insulted the charioteer he favored. Believing this to be a personal attack, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> ordered the Praetorian Guard to attack the crowd and lead off and kill those shouting insults at his driver. 5 The praetorians, given authority to use force and to rob, but no longer able to identify those who had shouted so recklessly (it was impossible to find them in so large a mob, since no one admitted his guilt), took out those they managed to catch and either killed them or, after taking whatever they had as ransom, spared their lives, but reluctantly. </p>                        </div>

Only occasionally did he sit as judge, although he was quick to grasp the essentials of a case in court and quick to pass judgment on the basis of the arguments presented. 3 He grew especially fond of the Germans in those regions; after gaining their friendship, he entered into alliances with them, and selected for his personal bodyguard the strongest and most handsome young men. He frequently put off the Roman cloak and donned German dress, appearing in the short, silver-embroidered cloaks which they customarily wear, augmented by a yellow wig with the locks arranged in the German style. 4 Delighted with the emperor's antics, the barbarians became very fond of him, as did the Roman soldiers also, particularly because of his lavish gifts of money but also because he always played the soldier's part. If a ditch had to be dug anywhere, the emperor was the first man to dig; if it were necessary to bridge a stream or pile up a high rampart, it was the same; in every task involving labor of hand or body, the emperor was first man to the job. 5 He set a frugal table and even went so far as to use wooden dishes at his meals. He ate the bread that was available; grinding with his own hands his personal ration of grain, he made a loaf, baked it in the ashes, and ate it. 6 Scorning luxuries, he used whatever was cheapest and issued to the poorest soldier. He pretended to be delighted when they called him fellow soldier instead of emperor. For the most part he marched with the troops, carrying his own arms and rarely using a chariot or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. 7 Occasionally he even placed the standards of the legions on his shoulders and bore them along; these standards, tall and decorated with many gold ornaments, were a heavy burden for even the strongest soldiers. For these actions <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> won the affection of the soldiers by his military prowess and gained their admiration by his feats of strength. And it is certainly true that the performance of such strenuous tasks by a man of small stature was worthy of admiration. </p>                        </div>

They take delight in such orgiastic dancing, especially when they are drunk. 4 Abandoning their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and laying aside their quivers and bows, the whole populace came together to drink and pour libations. A huge mob of barbarians gathered and stood about casually, wherever they happened to be, eager to see the bridegroom and expecting nothing out of the ordinary. 5 Then the signal was given, and <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> ordered his army to attack and massacre the spectators. Astounded by this onslaught, the barbarians turned and fled, wounded and bleeding. <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> himself, snatched up and placed on a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> by some of his personal bodyguards, barely escaped with a few companions. 6 The rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, lacking their indispensable <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, were cut down (for they had sent the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> out to graze and were standing about).

But when the fighting came to close quarters, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> easily defeated the barbarians; for when the swarms of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> cavalry and hordes of <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a> riders were mauling them, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> pretended to retreat and then they threw down caltrops and other keen-pointed iron devices. Covered by the sand, these were invisible to the horsemen and the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a> riders and were fatal to the animals. 3 The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and particularly the tender-footed <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, stepped on these devices and, falling, threw their riders. As long as they are mounted on <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camels</a>, the barbarians in those regions fight bravely, but if they dismount or are thrown, they are very easily captured; they cannot stand up to hand-to-hand fighting. And, if they find it necessary to flee or pursue, the long robes which hang loosely about their feet trip them up. </p>                        </div>

While at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> wrote a letter to the senate and the Roman people in which he said the following: 2 You are familiar with the course of my life from its very beginning. You know my inclination toward uprightness of character, and are aware of the moderation with which I previously managed affairs, when my power and authority were little inferior to that of the emperor himself. For that reason, and since the emperor sees fit to put his trust in the praetorian prefects, I do not think it necessary for me to address you at great length. You know that I did not approve of the emperor's actions. Indeed, I frequently risked my life on your behalf when he listened to random charges and attacked you without mercy. 3 He criticized me harshly too, often publicly complaining about my moderation and my restraint in dealing with those under my authority, and ridiculing me for my easygoing ways and mild manner. He delighted in flatterers and men who encouraged him to cruelty and gave him good reason for his savagery by arousing his anger with slanderous charges. These people he considered his loyal friends. I, on the other hand, have from the beginning been mild, moderate, and agreeable. 4 We brought the war against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> to a conclusion, a critical struggle involving the safety of the whole Roman empire. In our courageous opposition to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> we proved in no way inferior to them, and in signing a treaty of peace we made a loyal friend instead of a dangerous enemy of a great king, who had marched against us at the head of a formidable army. Under my rule all men shall live in peace, and senatorial rule shall replace the autocracy. 5 But let no one think me unworthy of my post, and let no one believe that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> blundered in raising me to this position, even though I am of the Equestrian order. For what advantage is there in nobility of birth unless it be combined with a beneficent and kindly nature? The gifts of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> fall upon the undeserving also, but it is the excellence of his own soul which brings every man his measure of personal glory. Nobility of birth, wealth, and the like are presumed to bring happiness, but, since they are bestowed by someone else, they deserve no praise. 6 <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and kindness, on the other hand, besides commanding admiration, win a full measure of praise for anyone who succeeds by his own efforts. What, may I ask, did the noble birth of <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> profit you ? Or the fact that <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> inherited the throne from his father? Indeed, having received the empire as legal heirs, the two youths abused their high office and conducted themselves insolently, as if the empire were their own personal possession by right of inheritance. But those who receive the empire from your hands are eternally in your debt for the favor, and they undertake to repay those who have done them previous good services. 7 The noble ancestry of the highborn emperors leads them to commit insolent acts out of contempt for their subjects, whom they regard as far below them. By contrast, those who come to the throne as a result of temperate behavior treat the post with respect, since they secured it by toil; they continue to show to those who were formerly their superiors the same deference and esteem they were accustomed to show. 8 I intend to have you senators as my associates and assistants in managing the empire, and I intend to do nothing without your approval. You shall live in freedom and security, enjoying the privileges of which you were deprived by your nobly born emperors and which Marcus, of old, and <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>, recently, undertook to restore to you; the latter also are emperors who came to the throne from private circumstances. Surely it is better for a man to provide his descendants with the glorious beginnings of a family line than, having inherited ancestral glory, to disgrace it by outrageous behavior. </p>                        </div>

The fact is, however, that they rejoiced not so much at <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>' succession as at their own deliverance from <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. Every man, but especially those who had any claim to merit or distinction, felt that he had escaped a sword suspended over his head. 2 All informers and all slaves who had betrayed their masters were crucified; the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and virtually the entire Roman empire were purged of these scoundrels. Some were killed, others exiled; any who managed to escape, prudently laid low. As a result, men lived in complete security and in a semblance of freedom during the single year in which <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> was emperor. 3 But he made a great mistake in not immediately disbanding the armies, sending the soldiers back to their regular stations, and hurrying off to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> eager to welcome him, where the people were shouting for him on every occasion. Instead, he loitered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, cultivating his beard. He moved with greater deliberation than was necessary, and to those who approached him he made replies that were very slow, difficult to understand, and often inaudible because of the softness of his voice. 4 In doing all this he was imitating Marcus, but he failed to follow that emperor's example in other respects; he indulged in endless luxuries and devoted his time to dancing shows, recitals of every kind of music, and exhibitions of pantomime, while neglecting the administration of the empire. He appeared in public resplendent in brooches and wearing a stomacher lavishly adorned with gold and precious gems, extravagances of which the Roman soldiers did not approve because such ornaments seemed more appropriate to barbarians and women. 5 The soldiers were not at all pleased by what they saw; they disapproved of his way of life as too dissolute for a military man. When they contrasted it with their recollection of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>'s daily routine, which, being soldierly and austere, was the exact opposite, they had only contempt for <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>' extravagant behavior. 6 Other circumstances increased their irritation; still living in tents and sometimes short of supplies in a foreign land, even though a state of peace seemed to exist, they longed to return to their regular stations. When they saw <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>' luxury and laxity, they rebelled and spoke bitterly about him, praying for even a flimsy excuse to rid themselves of this annoyance. </p>                        </div>

During her sister's imperial career, the many years that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> were emperors, this woman lived in the imperial palace.

Since Maesa had lived for a long time under imperial protection, she had amassed a huge personal fortune. Thus the old woman now went off to live on her estates. Maesa had two daughters. 3 The elder was called Soaemias; the younger, <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a>. Each of the girls had an only son: Soaemias' son was named <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>; <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a>'s, Alexianus. These boys, who were reared by their mothers and their grandmother, were at that time about fourteen and ten, respectively. 4 They were priests of the sun god, whom their countrymen worship under the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> name <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. A huge temple was erected to this god, lavishly decorated with gold, silver, and costly gems. Not only is this god worshiped by the natives, but all the neighboring rulers and kings send generous and expensive gifts to him each year. 5 No statue made by man in the likeness of the god stands in this temple, as in Greek and Roman temples. The temple does, however, contain a huge black stone with a pointed end and round base in the shape of a cone. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> solemnly maintain that this stone came down from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; pointing out certain small figures in relief, they assert that it is an unwrought image of the sun, for naturally this is what they wish to see. 6 <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> was the chief priest of this god. (Since he was the elder of the boys, the priesthood had been entrusted to him.) He went about in barbarian dress, wearing long-sleeved purple tunics embroidered with gold which hung to his feet; robes similarly decorated with gold and purple covered his legs from hip to toe, and he wore a crown of varicolored precious gems. 7 <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>, in the prime of youth, was the handsomest lad of his time. With physical beauty, bloom of youth, and splendor of attire combining to produce the same effect, the youth might well be compared to the handsome statues of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>. </p>                        </div>

The soldiers were therefore frequent visitors in the city and went to the temple on the pretext of worshiping the god; there they delighted in watching <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a>. 10 Some were deserters and compatriots of Maesa; while they stood admiring the youth, Maesa, either inventing the story or telling the truth, informed them that <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> was really the son of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>, although it might appear that he had another father.

The men repeated her story to their fellow soldiers, and it soon became common knowledge throughout the army. 11 Maesa was rumored to be enormously wealthy, and it was reported that she would immediately give all her money to the soldiers if they restored the empire to her family. The soldiers agreed that if the family would come secretly to the camp at night, they would open the gates, receive the family inside, and proclaim <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> emperor and son of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. The old woman agreed to the plan, preferring to risk any danger rather than live in obscurity and appear to have been discarded. And so she slipped unnoticed out of the city at night with her daughters and grandsons. 12 Guided by soldiers who had deserted, they came to the wall of the camp and were warmly received inside. Immediately the entire army saluted <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> as Son of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>, and, wrapping him in a purple military cloak, held him inside the camp.

Contemptuously dismissing the affair as the efforts of children, and displaying his usual indolence, <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> remained at home, but he did send one of the praetorian prefects to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347367UEme class=place long=36.7143 lat=34.7239>Emesa</a> with a contingent of troops which he considered large enough to crush the rebels with the greatest of ease. 3 When <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> (for this was the prefect's name) arrived and attacked the walls of the camp, the soldiers inside, mounting the towers and battlements, displayed <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> to the besieging army; cheering the son of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>, they waved their full purses to induce the attackers to desert. 4 Believing that <a href=/people/11048 target=_blank>Bassianus</a> was the son of <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> and looked exactly like him (for this is what they wanted to see), the besieging soldiers cut off <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>' head and sent it back to <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>; when the gates were opened, all of them were welcomed into the camp. The troops, thus augmented, were sufficient not only to withstand a siege but also to fight a pitched battle at close quarters. The number of those who deserted each day, though they came in small groups, continued to increase the size of the army in the camp. </p>                        </div>

The soldiers of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>, however, did not wait for the attack. Finding his troops bold enough to march out confidently to engage <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> in battle, the youth led them from the city. 6 When the two armies met on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>' soldiers fought with spirit, fearing that if they should lose, they would suffer for what they had done. The soldiers of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, on the other hand, were completely indifferent and deserted to <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. 7 When <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> saw what was happening, he was afraid that, having lost all his troops, he would be captured and shamefully treated. While the battle was still raging, he stripped off his purple cloak and other imperial insignia and secretly left the field with a few centurions whom he believed to be especially loyal to him. To avoid recognition he shaved off his beard, donned a traveling cloak, and kept his head covered. 8 He traveled night and day and thus outdistanced the report of his disaster; the centurions drove the chariots at top speed, as if they had been sent by <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, still emperor, on an urgent mission. <br />And so <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> fled from the battle. Both armies continued the fight; the bodyguards and spearbearers whom they call praetorians fought for <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, these picked men making a courageous stand against the rest of the army; the remainder of the troops fought for <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>. 9 But when those who were fighting for <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> saw neither the emperor nor the imperial emblems for some time, they did not know whether he had been killed or had fled the battlefield, nor did they know what course they should follow under the circumstances. They had no desire to fight for a man who was absent, and were ashamed to surrender and, betrayed, become prisoners of war. 10 Informed by deserters of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>' flight, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> sent heralds to advise the praetorians that they were fighting vainly for a cowardly fugitive; he solemnly promised them security and amnesty, and offered them service as his bodyguard. Convinced, the praetorians switched their allegiance. <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> then sent men in pursuit of <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, who by that time had fled some distance. 11 The fugitive was finally captured at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>, desperately ill and exhausted by his continuous flight. His pursuers found him hiding in the outskirts of the city and cut off his head. It is said that he was hurrying to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, putting his faith in the people's enthusiastic support; but when he attempted to cross over to Europe by the narrow Propontic Gulf and was already close to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, they say that the wind was against him and carried him back to <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> and his fate. 12 So, by mischance, <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a> failed to elude his pursuers and met an ignoble end a little later while striving to get to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where he should have gone in the beginning.

The entire senate and all the knights stood watching, like spectators at the theater. The spices and entrails of the sacrificial animals were not carried by servants or men of low birth; 10 rather, they were borne along in gold vessels held on high by the praetorian prefects and the most important magistrates, who wore long-sleeved robes with a broad purple stripe in the center, robes which hung to their feet in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> style.

It was not necessary for him, she said, to look for a stranger or someone not a relative; he should entrust these duties to his own cousin. 3 It was then that the name of Alexianus was changed to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; the name of his grandfather became <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> was very famous and was held in high esteem by the alleged father of them both.

After adopting <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as Caesar, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> undertook to teach him his own practices; he instructed him in dancing and prancing, and, enrolling him in the priesthood, wanted the lad to imitate his appearance and actions. 5 But his mother <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a> kept <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> from taking part in activities so disgraceful and unworthy of an emperor. Privately, she summoned teachers of every subject and had her son trained in the lessons of self-discipline; since he devoted himself to wrestling and to physical exercise as well, he was, by his mother's efforts, educated according to both the Greek and the Roman systems. <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>, much annoyed at this, regretted his decision to make <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> his son and partner in the empire. 6 He therefore banished <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s teachers from the imperial palace; he put to death some of the most distinguished and sent others into exile. The emperor offered the most absurd excuses for doing this, claiming that these men, by teaching <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> self-control, educating him in human affairs, and refusing to allow him to dance and take part in the frenzied orgies, would corrupt his adopted son. The madness of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> increased to such a degree that he appointed all the actors from the stage and the public theaters to the most important posts in the empire, selecting as his praetorian prefect a man who had from childhood danced publicly in the Roman theater. 7 He elevated in similar fashion another young actor, putting him in charge of the education and conduct of the Roman youths and of the qualifications of those appointed to membership in the senatorial and Equestrian orders. To charioteers, comedians, and actors of mimes he entrusted the most important and responsible imperial posts.

They were annoyed when they saw the emperor, his face painted more elaborately than that of any modest woman, dancing in luxurious robes and effeminately adorned with gold necklaces. 2 As a result, they were more favorably disposed toward <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, for they expected great things of a lad so properly and modestly reared. They kept continual watch upon the youth when they saw that <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> was plotting against him. His mother <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a> did not allow her son to touch any food or drink sent by the emperor, nor did <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> use the cupbearers or cooks employed in the palace or those who happened to be in their mutual service; only those chosen by his mother, those who seemed most trustworthy, were allowed to handle <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s food. 3 <a href=/people/5762 target=_blank>Mamaea</a> secretly distributed money to the praetorians to win their good will for her son; it was to gold that the praetorians were particularly devoted. <br />When he learned this, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> plotted against <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his mother in every conceivable way, but Maesa, the grandmother of them both, foiled all his schemes; she was astute in every way and had spent much of her life in the imperial palace. As the sister of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' wife <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, Maesa had always lived with the empress at the court. 4 Therefore, none of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>' schemes escaped her attention, for the emperor was careless by nature, and his intrigues were always obvious. Since his plots failed, the emperor undertook to strip <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of the honor of Caesar, and the youth was no longer to be seen at public addresses or in public processions. 5 But the soldiers called for <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and were angry because he had been removed from his imperial post. <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> circulated a rumor that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was dying, to see how the praetorians would react to the news. When they did not see the youth, the praetorians were deeply grieved and enraged by the report; they refused to send the regular contingent of guards to the emperor and remained in the camp, demanding to see <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in the temple there. 6 Thoroughly frightened, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> placed <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in the imperial litter, which was richly decorated with gold and precious gems, and set out with him for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>. The guards opened the gates and, receiving them inside, brought the two youths to the temple in the camp. 7 They welcomed <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with enthusiastic cheers, but ignored the emperor. Fuming at this treatment, although he spent the night in the camp, <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> unleashed the fury of his wrath against the praetorians. He ordered the arrest and punishment of the guards who had cheered <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> openly and enthusiastically, pretending that these were responsible for the revolt and uproar. 8 The praetorians were enraged by this order; since they had other reasons, also, for hating <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>, they wished now to rid themselves of so disgraceful an emperor, and believed, too, that they should rescue the praetorians under arrest. Considering the occasion ideal and the provocation just, they killed <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> and his mother Soaemias (for she was in the camp as <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a> and as his mother), together with all his attendants who were seized in the camp and who seemed to be his associates and companions in evil. 9 They gave the bodies of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> and Soaemias to those who wanted to drag them about and abuse them; when the bodies had been dragged throughout the city, the mutilated corpses were thrown into the public sewer which flows into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> received the empire, the appearance and the title of emperor were allowed him, but the management and control of imperial affairs were in the hands of his women, and they undertook a more moderate and more equitable administration. 2 First, they chose from the senate, to be the emperor's advisory council, sixteen men who because of their age seemed most dignified and temperate in their conduct. Nothing was said or done unless these men had first considered the matter and given unanimous approval. The fact that the character of the imperial government was changed from an arrogant autocracy to a form of aristocracy pleased the people, the army, and especially the senators. 3 To begin with, the statues of the gods which <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> had moved or transferred were returned to their original positions in the ancient temples and shrines. The unqualified men whom <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> had promoted to positions of trust or honor or who were notorious for their crimes were deprived of what they had received from the emperor and were ordered by the councilors to return to their former occupations. 4 In all government business and matters of state, the emperor's council entrusted political matters and public affairs to those who were competent lawyers and skillful orators, while they put in charge of military affairs experienced men who were skilled in the arts of war. <br />After the empire had been governed in this manner for some time, Maesa, then an old woman, died; receiving the imperial honors, she became, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> believe, a deity. </p>                        </div>

Even though men were convicted of serious crimes, he nevertheless granted them pardons to avoid putting them to death, and not readily did any emperor of our time, after the reign of Marcus, act in this way or display so much concern for human life.

Before doing anything else, he thought it best, after consulting his advisers, to send an embassy to the king and by his letters halt the invasion and disappoint the barbarian's hopes. 4 In these letters he told <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> that he must remain within his own borders and not initiate any action; let him not, deluded by vain hopes, stir up a great war, but rather let each of them be content with what was already his. <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> would find fighting against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> not the same thing as fighting with his barbarian kinsmen and neighbors. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> further reminded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king of the victories won over them by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, and <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>.

Since you have now enjoyed many years of peace, you may be startled to hear something unusual or contrary to your anticipations. 4 Brave and intelligent men should pray for things to turn out for the best, but they should also endure whatever befalls. It is true that the enjoyment of things done for pleasure brings gratification, but good repute results from the manliness involved in setting matters straight when necessity demands. To initiate unjust actions is not proof of good intentions, but it is a courageous deed to rid oneself of those who are troublesome if it is done with good conscience; one may expect good results if he has done nothing unjust but has avoided injustice. 5 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> has slain his master <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> empire is now <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>. Despising our arms and contemptuous of the Roman reputation, <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> is attempting to overrun and destroy our imperial possessions. I first endeavored by letters and persuasion to check his mad greed and his lust for the property of others. But the king, with barbarian arrogance, is unwilling to remain within his own boundaries and challenges us to battle. 6 Let us not hesitate to accept his challenge. You veterans remind yourselves of the victories which you often won over the barbarians under the leadership of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> and my father, <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>. You recruits, thirsting for glory and honor, make it clear that you know how to live at peace mildly and with propriety, but make it equally clear that you turn with courage to the tasks of war when necessity demands. 7 The barbarian is bold against the hesitant and the cowardly, but he does not stand up in like fashion to those who fight back; it is not in close-quarter combat that they battle the enemy with hope of success. Rather, they believe that whatever success they win is the result of plundering after a feigned retreat and flight. Discipline and organized battle tactics favor us, together with the fact that we have always been taught to conquer the barbarian. </p>                        </div>

One army he ordered to overrun the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> after marching north and passing through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, which seemed to favor the Roman cause. 2 He sent the second army to the eastern sector of the barbarian territory, where, it is said, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> rivers at their confluence empty into very dense marshes; these are the only rivers whose mouths cannot be clearly determined. The third and most powerful army he kept himself, promising to lead it against the barbarians in the central sector. He thought that in this way he would attack them from different directions when they were unprepared and not anticipating such strategy, and he believed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> horde, constantly split up to face their attackers on several fronts, would be weaker and less unified for battle. 3 The barbarians, it may be noted, do not hire mercenary soldiers as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> do, nor do they maintain trained standing armies. Rather, all the available men, and sometimes the women too, mobilize at the king's order. At the end of the war each man returns to his regular occupation, taking as his pay whatever falls to his lot from the general booty. 4 They use the bow and the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> in war, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> do, but the barbarians are reared with these from childhood, and live by hunting; they never lay aside their quivers or dismount from their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, but employ them constantly for war and the chase. <br /><a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> therefore devised what he believed to be the best possible plan of action, only to have <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> defeat his design. 5 The army sent through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> had an agonizing passage over the high, steep mountains of that country. (As it was still summer, however, they were able to complete the crossing.) Then, plunging down into the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, the Roman soldiers devastated the countryside, burning many villages and carrying off much loot. Informed of this, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king led his army to the aid of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, but met with little success in his efforts to halt the Roman advance. 6 This is rough country; while it provided firm footing and easy passage for the infantry, the rugged mountain terrain hampered the movements of the barbarian cavalry and prevented their riding down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> or even making contact with them. Then men came and reported to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king that another Roman army had appeared in eastern <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> and was overrunning the plains there. 7 Fearing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, after ravaging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> unopposed, might advance into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> left behind a force which he thought strong enough to defend <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, and hurried with his entire army into the eastern sector. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were advancing much too carelessly because they had met no opposition and, in addition, they believed that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his army, the largest and most formidable of the three, had already attacked the barbarians in the central sector. They thought, too, that their own advance would be easier and less hazardous when the barbarians were constantly being drawn off elsewhere to meet the threat of the emperor's army. 8 All three Roman armies had been ordered to invade the enemy's territory, and a final rendezvous had been selected to which they were to bring their booty and prisoners. But <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> failed them: he did not bring his army or come himself into barbarian territory, either because he was afraid to risk his life for the Roman empire or because his mother's feminine fears or excessive mother love restrained him. 9 She blocked his efforts at courage by persuading him that he should let others risk their lives for him, but that he should not personally fight in battle. It was this reluctance of his which led to the destruction of the advancing Roman army. The king attacked it unexpectedly with his entire force and trapped the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> like fish in a net; firing their arrows from all sides at the encircled soldiers, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> massacred the whole army. The outnumbered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were unable to stem the attack of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> horde; they used their shields to protect those parts of their bodies exposed to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> arrows. 10 Content merely to protect themselves, they offered no resistance. As a result, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were driven into one spot, where they made a wall of their shields and fought like an army under siege. Hit and wounded from every side, they held out bravely as long as they could, but in the end all were killed. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> suffered a staggering disaster; it is not easy to recall another like it, one in which a great army was destroyed, an army inferior in strength and determination to none of the armies of old. The successful outcome of these important events encouraged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king to anticipate better things in the future. </p>                        </div>

The emperor led his own large force to that city, and many of them perished too; so the affair brought the greatest discontent to the army and the greatest dishonor to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who was betrayed by bad luck and bad judgment. Of the three armies into which he had divided his total force, the greater part was lost by various misfortunes — disease, war, and cold. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> are reluctant to leave their wives, children, and homeland. 2 Now unexpected messages and dispatches upset <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and caused him even greater anxiety: the governors in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyria</a> reported that the Germans had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a> rivers, were plundering the Roman empire, and with a huge force were overrunning the garrison camps on the banks of these rivers, as well as the cities and villages there.

They were naturally enraged at this, and blamed <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for their misfortunes because he had betrayed affairs in the East by his cowardice and carelessness and was hesitant and dilatory about the situation in the North. 4 <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his advisers, too, feared for the safety of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> itself. They did not consider the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> threat at all similar to the German.

They say that as a boy he was a shepherd, but that in his youthful prime he was drafted into the cavalry because of his size and strength. After a short time, favored by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, he advanced through all the military ranks, rising eventually to the command of armies and the governing of provinces. 2 Because of his military experience, which I have noted above, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> put <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> in charge of training recruits for the entire army; his task was to instruct them in military duties and prepare them for service in war. By carrying out his assignments thoroughly and diligently, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> won the affection of the soldiers. He not only taught them their duties; he also demonstrated personally to each man what he was to do. As a result, the recruits imitated his manliness and were both his pupils and his admirers. 3 He won their devotion by giving them all kinds of gifts and rewards. Consequently, the recruits, who included an especially large number of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=ethnic long=19 lat=45>Pannonians</a>, praised the masculinity of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> and despised <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as a mother's boy. Their contempt for the emperor was increased by the fact that the empire was being managed by a woman's authority and a woman's judgment, and by the fact that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had directed the campaigns carelessly and timidly. They reminded each other of the defeats in the East which had resulted from the emperor's negligence and of his failure to do anything courageous or vigorous when he faced the Germans. 4 The soldiers were therefore ready for a change of emperors. They had additional reasons for discontent: they considered the current reign burdensome because of its long duration; they thought it profitless for them now that all rivalry had been eliminated; and they hoped that the reign which they intended to institute would be advantageous to them and that the empire would be much coveted and highly valued by a man who received it unexpectedly. They plotted now to kill <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and proclaim <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> emperor and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, since he was their fellow soldier and messmate and seemed, because of his experience and courage, to be the right man to take charge of the present war. 5 They therefore assembled on the drill field for their regular training; when <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> took his position before them, either unaware of what was happening or having secretly made prior preparations for the event, the soldiers robed him in the imperial purple and proclaimed him emperor. 6 At first he refused the honor and threw off the purple, but when they pressed him and, waving their swords, threatened to kill him, he preferred the future risk to the present danger and accepted the empire; often before, he said, dreams and prophecies had predicted this good fortune. He told the soldiers, however, that he accepted the honor unwillingly; he did not really want it and was simply obeying their wish in the matter. 7 He then directed the soldiers to put their thoughts into action, to take up arms and hurry off to attack <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> while he was still unaware of what had happened. By reaching the emperor before the news of their approach came, they would surprise his soldiers and his bodyguards too. They would either persuade <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s forces to join them, or would overcome them with no difficulty, since the imperial forces would be unprepared and anticipating nothing of this nature. 8 After arousing great enthusiasm and good will among the troops, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> doubled their rations, promised them lavish gifts, and revoked all sentences and punishments.

The soldiers guarding the emperor on that day cheered his words; forming an escort, they promised to defend him to the death. 3 When the night had passed, men came at dawn to report that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was approaching; they said that a cloud of dust could be seen in the distance, and the shouting of a huge throng was audible. Then <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> came again to the drill field, summoned his troops, and begged them to fight to preserve the life of a man whom they had reared and under whose rule they had lived well content for fourteen years. After this effort to move the soldiers to compassion, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ordered them to take up arms and go forth to battle. 4 At first the soldiers obeyed him, but they soon left the field and refused to fight. Some demanded for execution the commanding general of the army and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s associates, pretending that they were responsible for the revolt. Others condemned the emperor's greedy mother for cutting off their money, and despised <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for his pettiness and stinginess in the matter of gifts. 5 For a time they did nothing but shout this barrage of charges. When the army of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> came into view, the clamoring recruits called upon <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s soldiers to desert the miserly woman and the timid, mother-dominated youth; at the same time they urged his soldiers to join them in supporting a brave and intelligent man, a fellow soldier who was always under arms and busy with military matters. Convinced, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s troops deserted him for <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, who was then proclaimed emperor by all. 6 Trembling with fear, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was scarcely able to retire to his quarters. Clinging to his mother and, as they say, complaining and lamenting that she was to blame for his death, he awaited his executioner. After being saluted as emperor by the entire army, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> sent a tribune and several centurions to kill <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and his mother, together with any of his followers who opposed them. 7 When these men came to the emperor's quarters, they rushed in and killed him with his mother; they also cut down those whom he had honored or who appeared to be his friends. Some, however, managed to flee or to hide for the moment, but <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> soon rounded up these fugitives and put them to death. </p>                        </div>

He had inherited the brutal disposition of his countrymen, and he intended to make his imperial position secure by acts of cruelty, fearing that he would become an object of contempt to the senate and the people, who might be more conscious of his lowly origin than impressed by the honor he had won. Everyone knew and spread the story that when he was a shepherd in the mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, he enlisted in a local auxiliary cohort because of his huge size and great strength, and by luck became the emperor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 3 He therefore immediately disposed of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s friends and associates, together with his senatorial advisers. Some he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; others he dismissed for administrative reasons, in order to gain sole command of the army. He wanted no one around him who was superior to him in birth, desiring to act the tyrant as if from a lofty height, with no one near to whom he must defer. 4 He banished from the imperial palace the entire band of attendants who had served <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for many years; he put most of them to death, suspecting that they were plotting against him, for he knew that they were still grieving over <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s assassination. <br /><a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was aroused to even greater fury by a plot allegedly formed by many centurions and all the senators. 5 A man of the nobility and consular rank named <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> was accused of organizing a conspiracy against the emperor and persuading some of the soldiers to transfer the empire to his charge. The plot was said to be something like this. <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had bridged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> River and was about to cross over and attack the Germans; 6 for, as soon as he got control of the empire, he immediately began military operations. Since it appeared that he had been chosen emperor because of his great size, military prowess, and experience in war, he undertook to confirm by action the good reputation and high esteem he enjoyed among the soldiers. In this way, too, he tried to demonstrate that the charges of vacillation and timidity in military matters they brought against <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> were well founded. Therefore he did not halt the soldiers' training and exercises, and remained under arms himself, spurring the army to action. 7 Now, with the bridge completed, he was about to cross over to attack the Germans. <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, however, was said to have persuaded a few prominent soldiers, particularly those assigned to guard and maintain the bridge, to destroy the structure after <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had crossed, and to betray the emperor to the barbarians by cutting off his only return route. After the bridge had been destroyed, the great river, very wide and deep, would be impassable, as no boats were available on the enemy's side. 8 Such was the report of the plot, but whether it was actually true or whether it was fabricated by <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> it is not easy to say, because the matter was not investigated. <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> did not bring the conspirators to trial or allow them an opportunity to defend themselves; he arrested without warning all who were suspected and executed them without mercy. </p>                        </div>

Under his command was a vast number of men, virtually the entire Roman military force, together with many Maurousian javelin men and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370390ROsr class=demonym long=39 lat=37>Osroenian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> archers; some were subject peoples, others friends and allies, and included, too, were a number of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> mercenaries and slaves captured by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. 2 This enormous force was originally assembled by <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, but it was increased in size and trained for service by <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. The javelin men and archers seemed to be especially effective against the Germans, taking them by surprise, attacking with agility and then retreating without difficulty. 3 Though he was in enemy territory, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> advanced for a considerable distance because all the barbarians had fled and he met no opposition. He therefore laid waste the whole country, taking particular care to destroy the ripening grain, and burned the villages after allowing the army to plunder them. Fire destroys the German towns and houses very quickly. 4 Although there is a scarcity of stone and fired brick in <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a>, the forests are dense, and timber is so abundant that they build their houses of wood, fitting and joining the squared beams. <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> advanced deep into German territory, carrying off booty and turning over to the army all the herds they encountered. 5 The Germans had left the plains and treeless areas and were hiding in the forests; they remained in the woods and marshes so that the battle would have to take place where the thick screen of trees made the missiles and javelins of their enemies ineffectual and where the depths of the marshes were dangerous to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> because of their unfamiliarity with the region. The Germans, on the contrary, were well acquainted with the terrain and knew which places provided firm footing and which were impassable. They moved rapidly and easily through the marshes, in water only knee-deep. 6 The Germans, who do all their bathing in the rivers, are expert swimmers. <br />As a result, most of the skirmishing occurred in those regions, and it was there that the emperor personally and very boldly joined battle. When the Germans rushed into a vast swamp in an effort to escape and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> hesitated to leap in after them in pursuit, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> plunged into the marsh, though the water was deeper than his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s belly; there he cut down the barbarians who opposed him. 7 Then the rest of the army, ashamed to betray their emperor who was doing their fighting for them, took courage and leaped into the marsh behind him. A large number of men fell on both sides, but, while many <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were killed, virtually the entire barbarian force was annihilated, and the emperor was the foremost man on the field. The swamp pool was choked with bodies, and the marsh ran red with blood; this land battle had all the appearance of a naval encounter. 8 This engagement and his own bravery <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> reported in dispatches to the senate and Roman people; moreover, he ordered the scene to be painted on huge canvases to be set up in front of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a>, so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> might not only hear about the battle but also be able to see what happened there. Later the senate removed this picture together with the rest of his emblems of honor. Other battles took place in which <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> won praise for his personal participation, for fighting with his own hands, and for being in every conflict the best man on the field. 9 After taking many German prisoners and seizing much booty, the emperor, since winter had already begun, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a> and spent his time at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a>, the largest city in that country; there he made preparations for his spring offensive.

What profit was there in killing barbarians when greater slaughter occurred in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the provinces? Or in carrying off booty captured from the enemy when he robbed his fellow countrymen of all their property? 2 Complete indulgence — encouragement, I should say — was granted to informers to threaten and insult, and to reopen any known crimes committed by a man's ancestors which were hitherto unexposed and undetected. Anyone who was merely summoned into court by an informer was immediately judged guilty, and left with all his property confiscated. 3 It was thus possible every day to see men who yesterday had been rich, today reduced to paupers, so great was the avarice of the tyrant, who pretended to be insuring a continuous supply of money for the soldiers. The emperor's ears were always open to slanderous charges, and he spared neither age nor position. He arrested on slight and trivial charges many men who had governed provinces and commanded armies, who had won the honor of a consulship, or had gained fame by military victories. 4 He ordered these men to be brought in chariots to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, where he was then passing the time; they were to travel day and night, without an escort, from the east, the west, and the south, wherever they happened to be. After insulting and torturing these prisoners, he condemned them to exile or death. <br />As long as his actions affected only individuals and the calamities suffered were wholly private, the people of the cities and provinces were not particularly concerned with what the emperor was doing. 5 Unpleasant things which happen to those who seem to be fortunate or wealthy are not only a matter of indifference to the mob, but they often bring pleasure to mean and malicious men, who envy the powerful and the prosperous. After <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had impoverished most of the distinguished men and confiscated their estates, which he considered small and insignificant and not sufficient for his purposes, he turned to the public treasuries; all the funds which had been collected for the citizens' welfare or for gifts, all the funds being held in reserve for shows or festivals, he transferred to his own personal fortune. The offerings which belonged to the temples, the statues of the gods, the tokens of honor of the heroes, the decorations on public buildings, the adornments of the city, in short, any material suitable for making coins, he handed over to the mints. 6 But what especially irked the people and aroused public indignation was the fact that, although no fighting was going on and no enemy was under arms anywhere, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> appeared to be a city under siege. Some citizens, with angry shaking of fists, set guards around the temples, preferring to die before the altars than to stand by and see their country ravaged. From that time on, particularly in the cities and the provinces, the hearts of the people were filled with rage. The soldiers too were disgusted with his activities, for their relatives and fellow citizens complained that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was acting solely for the benefit of the military. </p>                        </div>

Prayers were offered by all, and the outraged gods were invoked, but no one dared to start anything until, after <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had completed three years as emperor, the people of Africa first took up arms and touched off a serious revolt for one of those trivial reasons which often prove fatal to a tyrant. The uprising occurred in this manner. 2 The procurator of Africa was a man who performed his duties with excessive severity; he handed down extremely harsh decisions and extorted money to win the emperor's favor. <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> always appointed men who subscribed to his way of thinking. The treasury officials at that time, even if they happened to be honest, which was rarely the case, since they foresaw their own risks and knew the emperor's avarice, acted as dishonestly as the rest, even if they did so against their will. 3 Then the procurator of Africa, who acted the tyrant with everyone, involved in lawsuits some young men of the wealthiest and most aristocratic local families and undertook to extort money from them and rob them of their inheritances. Angered by this, the youths promised to pay him the money, but requested a delay of a few days. Calling a meeting, they won the support of all who were known to have suffered an injury or feared that they might suffer one. They ordered the field laborers to come into the city at night armed with clubs and axes. 4 Obeying their masters' orders, the workmen entered the city in a body before daybreak, carrying arms for hand-to-hand fighting hidden under their clothes. A large number assembled; for Africa, which is a heavily populated province, has many farmers. 5 When dawn was approaching, the youths appeared and ordered the mob of workmen to follow them as if they were simply part of the crowd; they directed the workmen to take their assigned positions and, keeping their weapons hidden, to resist bravely if any of the soldiers or the people should attack them to avenge the deed they were plotting. 6 Carrying daggers under their robes, the youths approached the procurator as if to discuss the payment of the money; then, attacking him suddenly, they stabbed and killed him. When his bodyguards drew their swords in retaliation, the workmen from the fields pulled out their clubs and axes and, fighting for their masters, easily routed their opponents. </p>                        </div>

They knew that the governor, who hated <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, had long prayed for this, but was afraid to act. 2 As it was now noon, the entire group went to the house of the proconsul. The governor, whose name was <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, had received the African post by lot when he was about eighty years old, after he had previously governed many provinces and served in the highest public offices. For this reason the youths believed that he would accept with pleasure the office of emperor as the crowning achievement in his career in public office; they thought that the senate and the Roman people would be glad to accept as emperor a man from the aristocracy who had risen to the high office after many governorships as if in a regular cursus. 3 It happened that on the day these events occurred <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> was at home resting, enjoying a brief respite from his labors and duties. Accompanied by the entire band with drawn swords, the youths overpowered the guards on duty at the gates and burst into the house, where they found <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> resting on a couch. Standing around him, they draped him in a purple cloak and greeted him with the imperial honors. 4 Astounded by this unexpected turn of events, and thinking it was an act of treachery or part of a plot against him, <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> threw himself to the floor, begging them to spare the life of an old man who had never harmed them and to continue to display their loyalty and good will toward the emperor. But the youths were insistent and drew their swords. <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, alarmed and unaware of what had occurred, did not understand the situation. One of the youths, a talented speaker of distinguished family, asked for quiet and ordered the rest to remain silent. 5 Then, sword in hand, he addressed <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> as follows: With two dangers threatening you, the one present, the other future, the one already obvious, the other a remote possibility, you must make your choice whether to enjoy safety with us and have faith in greater things to come, in which indeed we have all placed our trust, or to die at our hands this very moment. If you elect to accept the present situation, there are many factors which augur well for the future: Maximums' hatred of everyone; the people's longing for deliverance from a cruel tyrant; their approval of your conduct in your former offices; and the fact that among the senate and the Roman people you enjoy a distinguished reputation and are held in high esteem. 6 But death awaits you this very day if you decide against us and refuse to join us, and we shall die ourselves, if need be, after we have killed you. We have done a deed which calls for even more desperate measures. The tyrant's procurator is dead, having paid the penalty for his savagery — death at our hands. If you join us and share our peril you will enjoy the honor of being emperor, and the deed which we have done will be praised, not punished. </p>                        </div>

The fact is that all peoples are eager for a change of government, but the Roman mob, because of its tremendous size and diverse elements, is unusually prone to instability and vacillation. 2 Therefore the statues, paintings, and all of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' emblems of honor were destroyed, and the hatred which fear had hitherto suppressed now poured forth without hindrance, freely and fearlessly. The senators met before they received accurate information concerning <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> and, placing their trust for the future in the present situation, proclaimed <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, together with his son, and destroyed <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' emblems of honor. 3 Informers and men who were bringing lawsuits either fled or were killed by those against whom they had brought unjust charges; officials and judges who had been the instruments of his savagery were dragged about the city by the mob and were then thrown into the sewers. There was great slaughter of those innocent of wrongdoing: without warning, men broke into the houses of their creditors and their opponents in lawsuits, indeed into the house of anyone they hated for some trivial reason; after threatening and abusing them as informers, their attackers robbed and killed them. 4 Acts of civil war were committed in the name of freedom and peace and security; for example, the man who had been appointed prefect of the city after having held many consular offices (his name was <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>) was struck on the head by a stone and killed while he was trying to prevent what was happening in the city. <br />This is what the people did, but the senate, once it recognized the danger, did everything in its power to induce the provinces to revolt against <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. 5 Embassies composed of senators and distinguished Equestrians were sent to all the governors with letters which clearly revealed the attitude of the senate and the Roman people. These letters requested the governors to aid the common fatherland and the senate with their counsel, and urged the provinces to remain loyal to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where the power and authority from the beginning had been in the hands of the people, whose friends and subjects the provinces were from the time of their ancestors. 6 The majority of the governors welcomed the embassies and had no difficulty in arousing the provinces to revolt because of the general hatred of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>.

Then the elder <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, some say, was in despair because Capelianus was attacking <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; when he considered the size of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' army and reflected that there were no forces in Africa strong enough to match it, he hanged himself. 5 His death was kept secret, however, and his son was chosen to command the crowd of civilians. When the battle was joined, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> were superior in numbers, but they were an undisciplined mob, without military training; for they had grown up in a time of complete peace and indulged themselves constantly in feasts and festivals. To make it worse, they were without arms and proper equipment. 6 Each man brought from home a dagger, an ax, or a hunting spear; those who found hides cut out circles of leather, arranged pieces of wood as a frame, and fashioned shields as best they could. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, by contrast, were excellent javelin men and superb horsemen. Scorning a bridle they used only a stick to guide their mounts. 7 They easily routed the huge <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> mob; without waiting for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>' charge, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> threw down their arms and fled.

There the son of <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> died, together with all his companions, and the number of dead was so great that it was impossible to gather them for burial. The body of the young <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> was never found. 8 A few of the many who rushed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and found a place to hide managed to save themselves; they scattered throughout the city, which is huge and densely populated.

When the death of the elder <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> was reported at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the people and the senate particularly were completely bewildered, dumfounded to learn that <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, in whom they had placed their hope, was dead. They knew that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, who was naturally hostile and antagonistic toward them, would spare no one. Now that he had good reason for hatred, he would as a matter of course vent his rage upon them as upon acknowledged enemies. 2 The senate therefore thought it best to meet and consider what should be done. Since they had already cast the die, they voted to issue a declaration of war and choose two men from their own ranks to be joint emperors, dividing the imperial authority so that the power might not be in one man's hands and thus plunge them again into autocracy. They did not meet as usual in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> but in the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=person long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitolinus</a>, the god whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> worship on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a> Hill. 3 They shut themselves up alone in this temple, as if to have <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> as their witness, fellow council member, and overseer of their actions. Choosing the men most distinguished for their age and merit, they approved them by ballot. Other senators received votes, but on the final count <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> were elected joint emperors by majority opinion. 4 <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> had held many army commands; appointed prefect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he administered the office with diligence and enjoyed among the people a good reputation for his understanding nature, his intelligence, and his moderate way of life. <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>, an aristocrat who had twice served as consul and had governed provinces without complaint, had a more open and frank nature. 5 After their election, the two men were proclaimed Augusti, and the senate awarded them by decree all the imperial honors. <br />While these actions were being taken on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a> Hill, the people, whether they were informed by <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>'s friends and fellow countrymen or whether they learned it by rumor, filled the entire street leading up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. The huge mob was armed with stones and clubs, for they objected to the senate's action and particularly disapproved of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>. 6 The prefect ruled the city too strictly for the popular taste, and was very harsh in his dealings with the criminal and reckless elements of the mob. In their fear and dislike of <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, they kept shouting threats to kill both emperors, determined that the emperor be chosen from the family of <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> and that the title remain in that house and under that name. 7 <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> and <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> surrounded themselves with an escort of swordsmen from the young Equestrians and the discharged soldiers living in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and tried to force their way from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>.

Finding the lad playing at home, they lifted him to their shoulders and brought him to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> through the midst of the crowd. Showing the boy to the people and telling them that he was the son of <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, they called him <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a>, while the mob cheered the boy and scattered leaves in his path. 9 The senate appointed him Caesar, since he was not old enough to be emperor.

The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were in the habit of coming to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> to find out what the senate was doing. 2 When the praetorians whom <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> had left behind in the camp at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> learned of this practice (they were discharged veterans who had remained at home because of their age), they came unarmed and in civilian dress to the door of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> to find out what was happening and stood there with the rest of the crowd. 3 The other spectators remained outside, but two or three praetorians who were more curious than the rest, wishing to hear what was being planned, entered the council chamber, pushing past the base of the statue of <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a>. Then a senator of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=demonym long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginian</a> race named Gallicanus, who had recently been consul, and another senator named <a href=/people/1293 target=_blank>Maecenas</a>, a man of praetorian rank, attacked the soldiers as they stood with their hands under their cloaks, and stabbed them to the heart with daggers hidden under their robes. 4 As a result of the recent revolt and disorder, all the senators were armed with daggers, openly or secretly, claiming that they were carrying them for protection against possible enemy plots. The praetorians who were struck down on this occasion, having no opportunity to defend themselves because the attack was wholly unexpected, lay dead at the base of the statue of <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a>. 5 When the other praetorians saw this, they were terrified by the fate of their comrades. Unarmed and fearing the size of the mob, they turned and fled. Gallicanus ran out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> into the crowd, displaying the dagger in his bloody hand, and ordered the mob to pursue and kill the enemies of the senate and the Roman people, the friends and supporters of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. 6 The mob, easily persuaded, cheered Gallicanus and set out after the praetorians, hurling stones. The soldiers, few in number and wounded as well, fled before their pursuers; running into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, they shut the gates, took up arms, and posted guards on the walls. Gallicanus, by his reckless crime, brought civil war and widespread destruction upon the city. 7 He persuaded the people to break into the public arsenals, where armor used in parades rather than in battle was stored, each man to protect himself as best he could. He then threw open the gladiatorial schools and led out the gladiators armed with their regular weapons; finally, he collected all the spears, swords, and axes from the houses and shops. 8 The people, as if possessed, seized any tools they could find, made of suitable material, and fashioned weapons. They assembled and went out to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, where they attacked the gates and walls as if they were actually organizing a siege. The praetorians, with their vast combat experience, protected themselves behind their shields and the battlements; wounding their attackers with arrows and long spears, they kept them from the walls and drove them back. 9 With evening approaching, the besiegers decided to retire, since the civilians were exhausted and most of the gladiators were wounded. The people retreated in disorder, thinking that the few praetorians would not dare to pursue so large a mob. But the praetorians now threw open the gates and gave chase. They slaughtered the gladiators, and the greater part of the mob also perished, crushed in the confusion. After following the mob for a short distance, the praetorians returned and remained inside the walls of the camp. </p>                        </div>

The young men were assembled and armed with whatever weapons were at hand. <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> led most of these soldiers out to attack <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>; the rest remained behind to guard and defend the city. 2 Daily attacks were launched against the walls of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, but these assaults accomplished nothing, as the soldiers put up a stout resistance from their higher position. Struck and wounded, the attackers suffered heavily in the fighting. <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>, who had remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, issued an edict in which he pleaded with the people to effect a truce and promised amnesty to the soldiers, offering them pardon for all their offenses. 3 But he failed in his efforts to persuade either side: so huge a mob thought it disgraceful to be defied by a mere handful of men, and the praetorians were enraged to be suffering these barbaric indignities at the hands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Finally, when the attacks on the walls made no progress, the generals decided that it would be good strategy to block off all the streams flowing into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a> and thus overcome the soldiers by cutting off their water supply. 4 They therefore stopped the flow of water into the camp and diverted it into other channels, damming up the beds of the streams which flowed under the walls. Recognizing the danger, the despairing praetorians opened the gate and rushed forth to the attack. A sharp skirmish resulted and, when the mob fled, the guards pursued and drove them into all parts of the city. 5 Bested in the hand-to-hand fighting, the people climbed to the housetops and rained down upon the praetorians tiles, stones, and clay pots. In this way they inflicted severe injuries upon the soldiers, who, being unfamiliar with the houses, did not dare to climb after them, and, of course, the doors of the shops and houses were barred. The soldiers did, however, set fire to houses that had wooden balconies (and there were many of this type in the city). 6 Because a great number of houses were made chiefly of wood, the fire spread very rapidly and without a break throughout most of the city. Many men who lost their vast and magnificent properties, valuable for the large incomes they produced and for their expensive decorations, were reduced from wealth to poverty. 7 A great many people died in the fire, unable to escape because the exits had been blocked by the flames. All the property of the wealthy was looted when the criminal and worthless elements in the city joined with the soldiers in plundering. And the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> destroyed by fire was greater in extent than the largest intact city in the empire. </p>                        </div>

Halting at the borders, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> sent scouts ahead to find out whether any soldiers lay in ambush in the valleys, thickets, or mountain forests. 2 Leading his army down into level country, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> drew up the legions in a broad, shallow rectangle in order to occupy most of the plain; he placed all the heavy baggage, supplies, and wagons in the center of the formation and, taking command of the rear guard, followed with his troops. 3 On each flank marched the squadrons of armed cavalry, the Maurousian javelin men, and the archers from the East. The emperor also brought along a large number of German auxiliaries; he assigned these to the van to bear the initial assaults of the enemy. These men are savage and bold in the opening phases of battle; and if any risk were involved, the barbarian Germans were readily expendable. 4 When the troops had crossed the plain in good order and strict discipline, they came to the first city in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the one called Ema by the natives. Ema is situated on an elevated plateau at the foot of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>. From there advance guards and army scouts returned to report to <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> that the city was deserted. The inhabitants had fled in a body after setting fire to the doors of the temples and houses. As they had burned or carried off everything in the cities and fields, no food was left for men or animals. 5 <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was gratified by the immediate flight of these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>, and now anticipated that all the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> would flee at his approach. But the army was by no means pleased to find itself suffering from famine at the very outset. Therefore, after spending the night at Ema, some in the city in houses already stripped of doors and everything else, others in the fields around the city, at sunrise they pressed on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> are very tall mountains which nature has erected as a defensive wall for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; rising high above the clouds, they extend a great distance and encompass <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409115WTyr class=demonym long=11.5 lat=40.9>Tyrrhenian</a> Sea on the west to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=demonym long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian</a> Sea on the east. 6 The mountains are covered with limitless dense forests, and the passes are narrow because of the towering cliffs or rough, broken rocks. These narrow passes are man-made, fashioned with much labor by the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a>. The army advanced through these gaps with great anxiety, expecting the heights to be occupied and the paths blocked against their passage. Judging by the nature of the region, they were justified in their apprehensions. </p>                        </div>

Situated on the sea and with all the provinces of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> behind it, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> served as a port of entry for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. The city thus made it possible for goods transported from the interior by land or by the rivers to be traded to the merchant mariners and also for the necessities brought by sea to the mainland, goods not produced there because of the cold climate, to be sent to the upland areas. Since the inland people farm a region that produces much wine, they export this in quantity to those who do not cultivate grapes. 4 A huge number of people lived permanently in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, not only the native residents but also foreigners and merchants. At this time the city was even more crowded than usual; all the people from the surrounding area had left the small towns and villages and sought refuge there. They put their hope of safety in the city's great size and its defensive wall; this ancient wall, however, had for the most part collapsed. Under Roman rule the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> no longer had need of walls or arms; they had substituted permanent peace for war and had also gained a participating share in the Roman government. 5 Now, however, necessity forced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> to repair the wall, rebuild the fallen sections, and erect towers and battlements. After fortifying the city with a rampart as quickly as possible, they closed the gates and remained together on the wall day and night, beating off their assailants. Two senators named <a href=/people/1397 target=_blank>Crispinus</a> and Meniphilus, former consuls, were appointed generals. 6 These two had seen to everything with careful attention. With great foresight they had brought into the city supplies of every kind in quantities sufficient to enable it to withstand a long siege. An ample supply of water was available from the many wells in the city, and, a river flowing at the foot of the city wall provided both a defensive moat and an abundance of water. </p>                        </div>

When it was reported to <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> was well defended and tightly shut, he thought it wise to send envoys to discuss the situation with the townspeople from the foot of the wall and try to persuade them to open the gates. There was in the besieging army a tribune who was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, and whose wife, children, and relatives were inside the city. 2 <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> sent this man to the wall accompanied by several centurions, expecting their fellow citizen to win them over easily. The envoys told the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> that <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, their mutual emperor, ordered them to lay down their arms in peace, to receive him as a friend, not as an enemy, and to turn from killing to libations and sacrifices. Their emperor directed them not to overlook the fact that their native city was in danger of being razed to its very foundations, whereas it was in their power to save themselves and to preserve their city when their merciful emperor pardoned them for their offenses. Others, not they, were the guilty ones. 3 The envoys shouted their message from the foot of the wall so that those above might understand it. Most of the city's population was on the walls and in the towers; only those standing guard at other posts were absent. They all listened quietly to what the envoys were saying. 4 Fearing that the people, convinced by these lying promises, might choose peace instead of war and throw open the gates, <a href=/people/1397 target=_blank>Crispinus</a> ran along the parapet, pleading with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> to hold out bravely and offer stout resistance; he begged them not to break faith with the senate and the Roman people, but to win a place in history as the saviors and defenders of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. He warned them not to trust the promises of a tyrant, a liar, and a hypocrite, and not to surrender to certain destruction, lulled by soft words, when they could put their trust in the always unpredictable outcome of war. 5 Often, he continued, few have prevailed over many and those who appeared to be weaker have overcome those assumed to be stronger. Nor should they be frightened by the size of the besieging army. Those who fight on another's behalf, he said, well aware that the benefits, if any should result, will be not theirs but his, are less eager to do battle, knowing that while they share the risks, another will reap the greatest prizes of the victory. 6 But those who fight for their native land can look for greater favor from the gods because they do not pray for help in seizing the property of others, but ask only to be allowed to retain in safety what is already theirs. They show an enthusiasm for battle which results not from the orders of another but from their own inner compulsion, since all the fruits of victory belong to them and them alone. 7 By saying such things as these, <a href=/people/1397 target=_blank>Crispinus</a>, who was venerable by nature and highly skilled in speaking <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a>, and had governed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> moderately, succeeded in persuading them to remain at their assigned posts; he ordered the envoys to return unsuccessful to <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. He is said to have persevered in his prosecution of the war because the many men in the city who were skilled at auguries and the taking of auspices reported that the omens favored the townspeople. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> place particular reliance upon the taking of auguries. 8 Oracles, too, revealed to them that their native god promised them victory. They call this god Belis, and worship him with special devotion, identifying him with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, whose image, some of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' soldiers said, often appeared in the sky over the city, fighting for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a>. </p>                        </div>

Timber was scarce, and there were no boats which could be fastened together to span the river. Some of his engineers, however, called attention to the many empty wooden kegs scattered about the deserted fields, the barrels which the natives use to ship wine safely to those forced to import it. The kegs are hollow, like boats; when fastened together and anchored to the shore by cables, they float like pontoons, and the current cannot carry them off. Planks are laid on top of these pontoons, and with great skill and speed a bank of earth is piled up evenly on the platform thus fashioned. 5 After the bridge had been completed, the army crossed over and marched to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, where they found the buildings on the outskirts deserted. The soldiers cut down all the trees and grapevines and burned them, and destroyed the crops which had already begun to appear in those regions. Since the trees were planted in even rows and the interwoven vines linked them together everywhere, the countryside had a festive air; one might even say that it wore a garland of green. All these trees and vines <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' soldiers cut down to the very roots before they hurried up to the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>. 6 The army was exhausted, however, and it seemed wiser not to launch an immediate attack. The soldiers therefore remained out of range of the arrows and took up stations around the entire circuit of the wall by cohorts and legions, each unit investing the section it was ordered to hold. After a single day's rest, the soldiers kept the city under continuous siege for the remaining time. <br />They brought up every type of siege machinery and attacked the wall with all the power they could muster, leaving untried nothing of the art of siege warfare. 7 They launched numerous assaults virtually every day, and the entire army held the city encircled as if in a net, but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> fought back determinedly, showing real enthusiasm for war.

Bringing the flaming liquid to the walls, they scattered it over the soldiers like a heavy downpour of rain. 10 Carried along with the other ingredients, the pitch oozed onto the unprotected parts of the soldiers' bodies and spread everywhere. Then the soldiers ripped off their blazing corselets and the rest of their armor too, for the iron grew red hot, and the leather and wooden parts caught fire and burned. As a result, soldiers were seen everywhere stripping themselves, and the discarded armor appeared like the spoils of war, but these were taken by cunning and treachery, not by courage on the field of battle.

As time passed, however, the army of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> grew depressed and, cheated in its expectations, fell into despair when the soldiers found that those whom they had not expected to hold out against a single assault were not only offering stout resistance but were even beating them back. 2 The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a>, on the other hand, were greatly encouraged and highly enthusiastic, and, as the battle continued, their skill and daring increased. Contemptuous of the soldiers now, they hurled taunts at them. As <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> rode about, they shouted insults and indecent blasphemies at him and his son. The emperor became increasingly angry because he was powerless to retaliate. 3 Unable to vent his wrath upon the enemy, he was enraged at most of his troop commanders because they were pressing the siege in cowardly and halfhearted fashion. Consequently, the hatred of his supporters increased, and his enemies grew more contemptuous of him each day. <br />As it happened, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> had everything they needed in abundant quantities. With great foresight they had stored in the city all the food and drink required for men and animals. The soldiers of the emperor, by contrast, lacked every necessity, since they had cut down the fruit trees and devastated the countryside. 4 Some of the soldiers had built temporary huts, but the majority were living in the open air, exposed to sun and rain. And now many died of starvation; no food was brought in from the outside, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had blocked all the roads of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> by erecting walls provided with narrow gates. 5 The senate dispatched former consuls and picked men from all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to guard the beaches and harbors and prevent anyone from sailing. Their intent was to keep <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> in ignorance of what was happening at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; thus the main roads and all the bypaths were closely watched to prevent anyone's passing. The result was that the army which appeared to be maintaining the siege was itself under siege, for it was unable to capture <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> or leave the city and proceed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; all the boats and wagons had been hidden, and no vehicles of any kind were available to the soldiers. 6 Exaggerated rumors were circulated, based only on suspicion, to the effect that the entire Roman people were under arms; that all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was united; that the provinces of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and the barbarian nations in the East and South had gathered an army; and that everywhere men were solidly united in hatred of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>. The emperor's soldiers were in despair and in need of everything. There was scarcely even sufficient water for them. 7 The only source of water was the nearby river, which was fouled by blood and bodies. Lacking any means of burying those who died in the city, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> threw the bodies into the river; both those who fell in the fighting and those who died of disease were dropped into the stream, as the city had no facilities for burial. </p>                        </div>

Then one day, during a lull in the fighting, when most of the soldiers had gone to their quarters or their stations, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was resting in his tent.

They resolved no longer to ravage <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for an emperor they now knew to be a despicable tyrant. 9 Taking courage, therefore, the conspirators went to <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' tent about noon. The imperial bodyguard, which was involved in the plot, ripped <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' pictures from the standards; when he came out of his tent with his son to talk to them, they refused to listen and killed them both [A.D. 238]. They killed the army's commanding general also, and the emperor's close friends. Their bodies were handed over to those who wished to trample and mutilate them, after which the corpses were exposed to the birds and <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>.

Since the deed was accomplished, they tolerated it, but unwillingly; they had no choice but to be hypocritical and pretend to be pleased with all that had happened. 2 Then, laying down their arms, the soldiers came to the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a>, this time in peace, and reported the assassination of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, expecting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> to throw open the gates and welcome as friends yesterday's enemies.

And now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> set up a market on the walls, offering for sale a huge quantity of goods of all kinds, including ample supplies of food, drink, clothing, and shoes — in short, everything that a prosperous and flourishing city could provide for human consumption. 4 At this the soldiers were even more amazed; they now realized that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=ethnic long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileians</a> had enough of everything they needed even if the siege were prolonged, whereas they lacked all the necessities and would have perished to the last man before they captured a city so abundantly supplied. The army continued to remain in position around the city, while the soldiers purchased what they needed from the walls, each man buying as much as he chose. In the meantime, they discussed the situation among themselves. A state of peace and amity actually existed, even though the surrounded city appeared still under siege, with the army encamped on all sides. </p>                        </div>

They recalled the example of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, who dismissed the praetorians who had killed <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0015.tlg001:8.8.3'><b>&sect; 8.8.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a> Games were drawing to an end and all the people were occupied with festivals and shows, the praetorians suddenly brought their hidden resentments into the open. Making no attempt to control their anger, they launched an unreasoning assault; rushing into the palace with one purpose, they approached the aged emperors. 4 It so happened that the two men were not in complete accord: so great is the desire for sole rule and so contrary to the usual practice is it for the sovereignty to be shared that each undertook to secure the imperial power for himself alone. <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> considered himself the more worthy because of his noble birth and his two terms as consul; <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> felt that he deserved first place because he had served as prefect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and had won a good reputation by his administrative efforts. Both men were led to covet the sole rule because of their distinguished birth, aristocratic lineage, and the size of their families. 5 This rivalry was the basis of their downfall. When <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> learned that the Praetorian Guard was coming to kill them, he wished to summon a sufficient number of the German auxiliaries who were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to resist the conspirators. But <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>, thinking that this was a ruse intended to deceive him (he knew that the Germans were devoted to <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>), refused to allow <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> to issue the order, believing that the Germans were coming not to put down a praetorian uprising but to secure the empire for <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> alone. 6 While the two men were arguing, the praetorians rushed in with a single purpose. When the guards at the palace gates deserted the emperors, the praetorians seized the old men and ripped off the plain robes they were wearing because they were at home. Dragging the two men naked from the palace, they inflicted every insult and indignity upon them. Jeering at these emperors elected by the senate, they beat and tortured them, pulling their beards and eyebrows and doing them every kind of physical outrage. They then brought the emperors through the middle of the city to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, unwilling to kill them in the palace; they preferred to torture them first, so that they might suffer longer. 7 When the Germans learned what was happening, they snatched up their arms and hastened to the rescue. As soon as the praetorians were informed of their approach, they killed the mutilated emperors. Leaving the corpses exposed in the street, the praetorians took up <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> Caesar and proclaimed him emperor, since at the moment they could find no other candidate for the office. Proclaiming that they had only killed the men whom the people did not want to rule them in the first place, they chose as emperor this <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> who was descended from the <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> themselves had forced to accept the rule. Keeping their emperor <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> with them, they went off to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FCPr class=place long=12.506 lat=41.908>praetorian camp</a>, where they shut the gates and remained quiet. Learning that the men they were hurrying to rescue had been killed and their bodies exposed, the Germans returned to their quarters, unwilling to fight fruitlessly for men already dead. </p>                        </div>
