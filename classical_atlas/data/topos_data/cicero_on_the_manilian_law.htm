For as hitherto I have not dared, on account of my youth, to intrude upon the authority of this place, and as I considered that no arguments ought to be brought to this place except such as were the fruit of great ability, and worked up with the greatest industry, I have thought it fit to devote all my time to the necessities of my friends. [2] And accordingly, this place has never been unoccupied by men who were defending your cause, and my industry, which has been virtuously and honestly employed about the dangers of private individuals, has received its most honourable reward in your approbation. For when, on account of the adjournment of the comitia, I was three times elected the first praetor by all the centuries, I easily perceived, O Romans, what your opinion of me was, and what conduct you enjoined to others. Now, when there is that authority in me which you, by conferring honours on me, have chosen that there should be, and all that facility in pleading which almost daily practice in speaking can give a vigilant man who has habituated himself to the forum, at all events, if I have any authority, I will employ it before those who have given it to me; and if I can accomplish anything by speaking, I will display it to those men above all others, who have thought fit, by their decision, to confer honours on that qualification. </p>                        </div>

So that what I have to seek for is not so much a variety of arguments, as moderation in employing them. [4] And, that my oration may take its origin from the same source from which all this cause is to be maintained; an important war, and one perilous to your revenues and to your allies, is being waged against you by two most powerful kings, <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> and <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>. One of these having been left to himself, and the other having been attacked, thinks that an opportunity offers itself to him to occupy all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. Letters are brought from <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> every day to Roman knights, most honourable men, who have great property at stake, which is all employed in the collection of your revenues; and they, in consequence of the intimate connection which I have with their order, have come to me and entrusted me with the task of pleading the cause of the republic, and warding off danger from their private fortunes. [5] They say that many of the villages of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>, which is at present a province belonging to you, have been burnt; that the kingdom of <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, which borders on those districts from which you derive a revenue, is wholly in the power of the enemy; that <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, after having performed great exploits, is departing from that war; that it is not enough that whoever succeeds him should be prepared for the conduct of so important a war; that one general is demanded and required by all men, both allies and citizens, for that war; that he alone is feared by the enemy, and that no one else is. [6] You see what the case is; now consider what you ought to do. It seems to me that I ought to speak in the first place of the sort of war that exists; in the second place, of its importance; and lastly, of the selection of a general. The kind of war is such as ought above all others to excite and inflame your minds to a determination to persevere in it. It is a war in which the glory of the Roman people is at stake; that glory which has been handed down to you from your ancestors, great indeed in everything, but most especially in military affairs. The safety of our friends and allies is at stake, in behalf of which your ancestors have waged many most important wars. The most certain and the largest revenues of the Roman people are at stake; and if they be lost, you will be at a loss for the luxuries of peace, and the sinews of war. The property of many citizens is at stake, which you ought greatly to regard, both for your own sake, and for that of the republic. </p>                        </div>

Not but what praise is to be given to those generals for what they did. Pardon must be conceded to them for what they left undone; because the republic recalled <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> from that war into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> recalled <a href=/people/12001 target=_blank>Murena</a>. </p>                        </div>

However; [10] the danger on one side, the danger from <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a> and from Spain, which had much the most solid foundation and the most formidable strength, was warded off by the divine wisdom and extraordinary valour of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. And on the other side of the empire, affairs were so managed by <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a> <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, that most illustrious of men, that the beginning, of all those achievements in those countries, great and eminent as they were, deserve to be attributed not to his good fortune but to his valour; but the latter events which have taken place lately, ought to be imputed not to his fault, but to his ill-fortune. However, of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> I will speak hereafter, and I will speak, O Romans, in such a manner, that his true glory shall not appear to be at all disparaged by my pleading, nor, on the other hand, shall any undeserved credit seem to be given to him.

What ought to be your feelings when so many thousand Roman citizens have been put to death by one order and at one time? Because their ambassadors had been spoken to with insolence, your ancestors determined that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, the light of all Greece, should be destroyed. Will you allow that king to remain unpunished, who has murdered a lieutenant of the Roman people of consular rank, having tortured him with chains and scourging, and every sort of punishment? They would not allow the freedom of Roman citizens to be diminished; will you be indifferent to their lives being taken? They avenged the privileges of our embassy when they were violated by a word; will you abandon an ambassador who has been put to death with every sort of cruelty? [12] Take care lest, as it was a most glorious thing for them, to leave you such wide renown and such a powerful empire, it should be a most discreditable thing for you, not to be able to defend and preserve that which you have received. What more shall I say? Shall I say, that the safety of our allies is involved in the greatest hazard and danger? King <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a> has been driven from his kingdom, an ally and friend of the Roman people; two kings are threatening all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, who are not only most hostile to you, but also to your friends and allies. And every city throughout all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and throughout all Greece, is compelled by the magnitude of the danger to put its whole trust in the expectation of your assistance. They do not dare to beg of you any particular general, especially since you have sent them another, nor do they think that they can do this without extreme danger. [13] They see and feel this, the same thing which you too see and feel — that there is one man in whom all qualities are in the highest perfection, and that he is near, (which circumstance makes it seem harder to be deprived of him,) by whose mere arrival and name, although it was a maritime war for which he came, they are nevertheless aware that the attacks of the enemy were retarded and repressed. They then, since they cannot speak freely, silently entreat you to think them (as you have thought your allies in the other provinces) worthy of having their safety recommended to such a man; and to think them worthy even more than others, because we often send men with absolute authority into such a province as theirs, of such character, that, even if they protect them from the enemy, still their arrival among the cities of the allies is not very different from an invasion of the enemy. They used to hear of him before, now they see him among them; a man of such moderation, such mildness, such humanity, that those seem to be the happiest people among whom he remains for the longest time. </p>                        </div>

For the revenues of the other provinces, O Romans, are such that we can scarcely derive enough from them for the protection of the provinces themselves. But <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> is so rich and so productive, that in the fertility of its soil, and in the variety of its fruits, and in the vastness of its pasture lands, and in the multitude of all those things which are matters of exportation, it is greatly superior to all other countries. Therefore, O Romans, this province, if you have any regard for what tends to your advantage in time of war, and to your dignity in time of peace, must be defended by you, not only from all calamity, but from all fear of calamity. [15] For in other matters when calamity comes on one, then damage is sustained; but in the case of revenues, not only the arrival of evil, but the bare dread of it, brings disaster. For when the troops of the enemy are not far off, even though no actual irruption takes place, still the flocks are abandoned, agriculture is relinquished, the sailing of merchants is at an end. And accordingly, neither from harbour dues, nor from tenths, nor from the tax on pasture lands, can any revenue be maintained. And therefore it often happens that the produce of an entire year is lost by one rumour of danger, and by one alarm of war. [16] What do you think ought to be the feelings of those who pay us tribute, or of those who get it in, and exact it, when two kings with very numerous armies are all but on the spot? when one inroad of cavalry may in a very short time carry off the revenue of a whole year? when the publicans think that they retain the large households of slaves which they have in the salt-works, in the fields, in the harbours, and custom-houses, at the greatest risk? Do you think that you can enjoy these advantages unless you preserve those men who are productive to you, free not only, as I said before, from calamity, but even from the dread of calamity? </p>                        </div>

The publicans, 1 most honourable and accomplished men, have taken all their resources and all their wealth into that province; and their property and fortunes ought, by themselves, to be an object of your special care. In truth, if we have always considered the revenues as the sinews of the republic, certainly we shall be right if we call that order of men which collects them, the prop and support of all the other orders. [18] In the next place, clever and industrious men, of all the other orders of the state, are some of them actually trading themselves in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and you ought to show a regard for their interests in their absence; and others of them have large sums invested in that province. It will, therefore become your humanity to protect a large number of those citizens from misfortune; it will become your wisdom to perceive that the misfortune of many citizens cannot be separated from the misfortune of the republic. In truth, firstly, it is of but little consequence for you afterwards to recover for the publicans revenues which have been once lost; for the same men have not afterwards the same power of contracting for them, and others have not the inclination, through fear. [19] In the next place, that which the same <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and that same <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> taught us, at the beginning of the Asiatic war that, at all events, we, having learnt by disaster, ought to keep in our recollection.

For it is not possible for many men to lose their property and fortunes in one city, without drawing many along with them into the same vortex of disaster. But do you now preserve the republic from this misfortune; and believe me, (you yourselves see that it is the case,) this credit, and this state of the money-market which exists at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and in the forum, is bound up with, and is inseparable from, those fortunes which are invested in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. Those fortunes cannot fall without credit here being undermined by the came blow, and perishing along with them. Consider, then, whether you ought to hesitate to apply yourselves with all zeal to that war, in which the glory of your name, the safety of your allies, your greatest revenues, and the fortunes of numbers of your citizens, will be protected at the same time as the republic. </p>                        </div>

For this may be said of it — that it is a kind of war so necessary, that it must absolutely be waged, and yet not one of such magnitude as to be formidable. And in this we must take the greatest care that those things do not appear to you contemptible which require to be most diligently guarded against. And that all men may understand that I give Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> all the praise that is due to a gallant man, and most wise 2 man, and to a most consummate general, I say that when he first arrived in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, the forces of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> were most numerous, well appointed, and provided with every requisite; and that the finest city in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, and the one, too, that was most friendly to us, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, was besieged by the king in person, with an enormous army, and that the siege had been pressed most vigorously, when Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, by his valour, and perseverance, and wisdom, relieved it from the most extreme danger. [21] I say that he also, when general, defeated and destroyed that great and well-appointed fleet, which the chiefs of <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>'s party were leading against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with furious zeal; I say besides, that by him numerous armies of the enemy were destroyed in several battles, and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> was opened to our legions, which before his time had been closed against the Roman people on every side; and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=place long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinope</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413363PAmi class=place long=36.315 lat=41.312>Amisus</a>, towns in which the king had palaces, adorned and furnished with every kind of magnificence, and many other cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, were taken by his mere approach and arrival near them; that the king himself was stripped of the kingdom possessed by his father and his grandfather, and forced to betake himself as a suppliant to other kings and other nations; and that all these great deeds were achieved without any injury to the allies of the Roman people, or any diminution of its revenues. I think that this is praise enough; — such praise that you must see, O Romans, that Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> has not been praised as much from this rostrum by any one of these men who are objecting to this law and arguing against our cause. </p>                        </div>

I will explain this, O Romans; for this does not seem an unreasonable question. At first <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> fled from his kingdom, as <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> is formerly said to have fled from the same region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>; for they say that she, in her flight, strewed about the limbs of her brother in those places along which her father was likely to pursue her, in order that the collection of them, dispersed as they were, and the grief which would afflict his father, might delay the rapidity of his pursuit. <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, flying in the same manner, left in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> the whole of the vast quantity of gold and silver, and of beautiful things which he had inherited from his ancestors, and which he himself had collected and brought into his own kingdom, having obtained them by plunder in the former war from all <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>. While our men were diligently occupied in collecting all this, the king himself escaped out of their hands. [23] And so grief retarded the father of <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> in his pursuit, but delight delayed our men. In this alarm and flight of his, <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, received him, encouraged him while despairing of his fortunes, gave him new spirit in his depression, and recruited with new strength his powerless condition. And after Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> arrived in his kingdom, very many tribes were excited to hostilities against our general. For those nations which the Roman people never had thought either of attacking in war or tampering with, had been inspired with fear. There was, besides, a general opinion which had taken deep root, and had spread over all the barbarian tribes in those districts, that our army had been led into those countries with the object of plundering a very wealthy and most religiously worshipped temple. And so, many powerful nations were roused against us by a fresh dread and alarm. But our army although it had taken a city of <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>'s kingdom, and had fought some successful battles, still was out of spirits at its immense distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and its separation from its friends. [24] At present I will not say more; for the result of these feelings of theirs was, that they were more anxious for a speedy return home than for any further advance into the enemies' country. But <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> had by this time strengthened his army by reinforcements of those men belonging to his own dominions who had assembled together, and by large promiscuous forces belonging to many other kings and tribes. And we see that this is almost invariably the case, that kings when in misfortune easily induce many to pity and assist them, especially such as are either kings themselves, or who live under kingly power, because to them the name of king appears something great and sacred. [25] And accordingly he, when conquered, was able to accomplish what, when he was in the full enjoyment of his powers, he never dared even to wish for. For when he had returned to his kingdom, he was not content (though that had happened to him beyond all his hopes) with again setting his foot on that land after he had been expelled from it; but he even volunteered an attack on your army, flushed as it was with glory and victory. Allow me, in this place, O Romans, (just as poets do who write of Roman affairs,) to pass over our disaster, which was so great that it came to Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>'s ears, not by means of a messenger despatched from the scene of action, but through the report of common conversation. [26] At the very time of this misfortune — of this most terrible disaster in the whole war, Lucius <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, who might have been able, to a great extent, to remedy the calamity, being compelled by your orders, because you thought, according to the old principle of your ancestors, that limits ought to be put to length of command, discharged a part of his soldiers who had served their appointed time, and delivered over part to <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a>. I pass over many things designedly; but you yourselves can easily conjecture how important you ought to consider that war which most powerful kings are uniting in — which disturbed nations are renewing — which nations, whose strength is unimpaired, are undertaking, and which anew general of yours has to encounter after a veteran army has been defeated. </p>                        </div>

It remains for me to speak of the general who ought to be selected for that war, and appointed to the management of such important affairs. I wish, O Romans, that you had such an abundance of brave and honest men, that it was a difficult subject for your deliberations, whom you thought most desirable to be appointed to the conduct of such important affairs, and so vast a war. But now, when there is Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> alone, who has exceeded in valour, not only the glory of these men who are now alive, but even all recollections of antiquity, what is there that, in this case, can raise a doubt in the mind of any one? [28] For I think that these four qualities are indispensable in a great general — knowledge of military affairs, valour, authority and good fortune. Who, then, ever was, or ought to have been, better acquainted with military affairs than this man? who, the moment that he left school and finished his education as a boy, at a time when there was a most important war going on, and most active enemies were banded against us, went to his father's army and to the discipline of the camp; who, when scarcely out of his boyhood, became a soldier of a consummate general — when entering on manhood, became himself the general of a mighty army; who has been more frequently engaged with the enemy, than any one else has ever disputed with an adversary; who has himself, as general, conducted more wars than other men have read of; who has subdued more provinces than other men have wished for; whose youth was trained to the knowledge of military affairs, not by the precepts of others, but by commanding himself — not by the disasters of war, but by victories — not by campaigns, but by triumphs. In short, what description of war can there be in which the fortune of the republic has not given him practice? Civil war, African war, Transalpine war, Spanish war, promiscuous war of the most warlike cities and nations, servile war, naval war, every variety and diversity of wars and of enemies, has not only been encountered by this one man, but encountered victoriously; and these exploits show plainly that there is no circumstance, in military practice which can elude the knowledge of this man. </p>                        </div>

What statement can any one make which shall be either worthy of him, or new to you, or unknown to any one? For those are not the only virtuous of a general which are usually thought so — namely, industry in business, fortitude amid dangers, energy in acting, rapidity in executing, wisdom in foreseeing; which all exist in as great perfection in that one man as in all the other generals put together whom we have either seen or heard of.

O ye immortal gods! could the incredible and godlike virtue of one man in so short a time bring so much light to the republic, that you who had lately been used to see a fleet of the enemy before the mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, should now hear that there is not one ship belonging to the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> on this side of the <a href=/people/770 target=_blank>Atlantic</a>? [34] And although you have seen with what rapidity these things were done, still that rapidity ought not to be passed over by me in speaking of them. — For who ever, even if he were only going for the purpose of transacting business or making profit, contrived in so short a time to visit so many places, and to perform such long journeys, with as great celerity as Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> has performed his voyage, bearing with him the terrors of war as our general? He, when the weather could hardly be called open for sailing, went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, explored the coasts of Africa; from thence he came with his fleet to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, and these three great granaries of the republic he fortified with powerful garrisons and fleets; [35] when, leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, having secured the two Spains and Cisalpine Gaul with garrisons and ships. Having sent vessels also to the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and to every part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a> and Greece, he also adorned the two seas of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with very large fleets, and very sufficient garrisons; and he himself going in person, added all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> to the dominions of the Roman people, on the forty-ninth day after he set out from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundusium</a>. Will the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> who were anywhere to be found, were either taken prisoners and put to death, or else had surrendered themselves voluntarily to the power and authority of this one man. Also, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a> had sent ambassadors to implore his mercy even into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a> to him, he did not deny them hopes of being allowed to surrender, and he exacted hostages from them. And thus Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> at the end of winter prepared, at the beginning of spring undertook, and by the middle of summer terminated, this most important war, which had lasted so long, which was scattered in such distant and such various places, and by which every nation and country was incessantly distressed. </p>                        </div>

How many and how great are his other exploits which I began to mention a short time back; for we are not only to seek for skill in war in a consummate and perfect general, but there are many other eminent qualities which are the satellites and companions of this virtue. And first of all, how great should be the incorruptibility of generals! How great should be their moderation in everything! How perfect their good faith! How universal should be their affability! how brilliant their genius! how tender their humanity! And let us briefly consider to what extent these qualities exist in Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. For they are all of the highest importance, O Romans, but yet they are to be seen and ascertained more by comparison with the conduct of others than by any display which they make of themselves. [37] For how can we rank a man among generals of any class at all, if centurionships 4 are sold, and have been constantly sold in his army? What great or honourable thoughts can we suppose that that man cherishes concerning the republic, who has either distributed the money which was taken from the treasury for the conduct of the war among the magistrates, out of ambition 5 to keep his province, or, out of avarice, has left it behind him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, invested for his own advantage? Your murmurs show, O Romans, that you recognise, in my description, men who have done these things. But I name no one, so that no one can be angry with me, without making confession beforehand of his own malpractices. But who is there who is ignorant what terrible distresses our armies suffer wherever they go, through this covetousness of our generals? [38] Recollect the marches which, during these latter years, our generals have made in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, through the lands and towns of the Roman citizens; then you will more easily imagine what is the course pursued among foreign nations. Do you think that of late years more cities of the enemy have been destroyed by the arms of your soldiers, or more cities of your own allies by their winter campaigns? For that general who does not restrain himself can never restrain his army; nor can he be strict in judging others who is unwilling for others to be strict in judging him. [39] Do we wonder now that this man should be so far superior to all others, when his legions arrived in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> in such order that not only no man's hand in so numerous an army, but not even any man's footstep was said to have done the least injury to any peaceful inhabitant? But now we have daily rumours — yes, and letters too — brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> about the way in which the soldiers are behaving in their winter quarters; not only is no one compelled to spend money on the entertainment of the troops, but he is not permitted to do so, even if he wish. For our ancestors thought fit that the houses of our allies and friends should be a shelter to our soldiers from the winter, not a theatre for the exercise of their avarice. </p>                        </div>

How was it, do you suppose, that he was able to display that excessive rapidity, and to perform that incredible voyage? For it was no unexampled number of rowers, no hitherto unknown skill in navigation, no new winds, which bore him so swiftly to the most distant lands; but those circumstances which are wont to delay other men did not delay him. No avarice turned him aside from his intended route in pursuit of some plunder or other; no lust led him away in pursuit of pleasure; no luxury allured him to seek its delights; the illustrious reputation of no city tempted him to make its acquaintance; even labour did not turn him aside to seek rest. Lastly, as for the statues, and pictures, and other embellishments of Greek cities, which other men think worth carrying away, he did not think them worthy even of a visit from him. And, therefore, every one in those countries looks upon Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> as some one descended from heaven, not as some one sent out from this city. [41] Now they begin to believe that there really were formerly <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> of the same moderation; which hitherto has seemed to foreign nations a thing incredible, a false and ridiculous tradition. Now the splendour of your dominion is really brilliant in the eyes of those nations. Now they understand that it was not without reason that, when we had magistrates of the same moderation, their ancestors preferred being subject to the Roman people to being themselves lords of other nations. But now the access of all private individuals to him is so easy, their complaints of the injuries received from others are so little checked, that he who in dignity is superior to the noblest men, in affability seems to be on a par with the meanest. [42] How great his wisdom is, how great his authority and fluency in speaking — and that too is a quality in which the dignity of a general is greatly concerned — you, O Romans, have often experienced yourselves in this very place. But how great do you think his good faith must have been towards your allies, when the enemies of all nations have placed implicit confidence in it? His humanity is such that it is difficult to say, whether the enemy feared his valour more when fighting against him, or loved his mildness more when they had been conquered by him. And will any one doubt, that this important war ought to be entrusted to him, who seems to have been born by some especial design and favour of the gods for the express purpose of finishing all the wars which have existed in their own recollection? </p>                        </div>

And who is ignorant that it is of great importance in the conduct of wars, what opinion the enemy, and what opinion the allies have of your generals, when we know that men are not less influenced in such serious affairs, to despise, or fear, or hate, or love a man by common opinion and common report, than by sure grounds and principles? What name, then, in the whole world has ever been more illustrious than his? whose achievements have ever been equal to his? And, what gives authority in the highest degree, concerning whom have you ever passed such numerous and such honourable resolutions? [44] Do you believe that there is anywhere in the whole world any place so desert that the renown of that day has not reached it, when the whole Roman people, the forum being crowded, and all the adjacent temples from which this place can be seen being completely filled — the whole Roman people, I say, demanded Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> alone as their general in the war in which the common interests of all nations were at stake? Therefore, not to say more on the subject, nor to confirm what I say by instances of others as to the influence which authority has in war, all our instances of splendid exploits in war must be taken from this same Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. The very day that he was appointed by you commander-in-chief of the maritime war, in a moment such a cheapness of provisions ensued, (though previously there had been a great scarcity of corn, and the price had been exceedingly high,) owing to the hope conceived of one single man, and his high reputation, as could scarcely have been produced by a most productive harvest after a long period of peace. [45] Now, too, after the disaster which befell us in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, from the result of that battle, of which, sorely against my will, I just now reminded you, when our allies were in a state of alarm, when the power and spirits of our enemies had risen, and the province was in a very insufficient state of defence, you would have entirely lost <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, O Romans, if the fortune of the Roman people had not, by some divine interposition, brought Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> at that particular moment into those regions. His arrival both checked <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, elated with his unusual victory, and delayed <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>, who was threatening <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> with a formidable army. And can any one doubt what he will accomplish by his valour, when he did so much by his authority and reputation? or how easily he will preserve our allies and our revenues by his power and his army, when he defended them by the mere, terror of his name? </p>                        </div>

What did <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself do? Did he not send an ambassador into Spain to the same Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>? a man whom <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> has always considered an ambassador, but who that party, to whom it has always been a source of annoyance that he was sent to him particularly, have contended was sent as a spy rather than as an ambassador. You can now, then, O Romans, form an accurate judgment how much weight you must suppose that this authority of his — now, too, that it has been further increased by many subsequent exploits, and by many commendatory resolutions of your own — will have with those kings and among foreign nations. <br />[47] It remains for me timidly and briefly to speak of his good fortune, a quality which no man ought to boast of in his own case, but which we may remember and commemorate an happening to another, just as a man may extol the power of the gods. For my judgment is this, that very often commands have been conferred upon, and armies have been entrusted to <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, to <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, to <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, and to other great generals, not only on account of their valour, but also on account of their good fortune. For there has been, in truth, in the case of some most illustrious men, good fortune added as some contribution of the gods to their honour and glory, and as a means of performing mighty achievements. But concerning the good fortune of this man of whom we are now speaking, I will use so much moderation as not to say that good fortune was actually placed in his power, but I will so speak as to appear to remember what is past, to have good hope of what is to come; so that my speech may, on the one hand, not appear to the immortal gods to be arrogant, nor, on the other hand, to be ungrateful. [48] Accordingly, I do not intend to mention, O Romans, what great exploits he has achieved both at home and in war, by land and by sea, and with what invariable felicity he has achieved them; how, not only the citizens have always consented to his wishes — the allies complied with them — the enemy obeyed them, but how even the winds and weather have seconded them. I will only say this, most briefly — that no one has ever been so impudent as to dare in silence to wish for so many and such great favours as the immortal gods have showered upon Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. And that this favour may continue his, and be perpetual, you, O Romans, ought to wish and pray (as, indeed, you do), both for the sake of the common safety and prosperity, and for the sake of the man himself. <br /> [49] Wherefore, as the war is at the same time so necessary that it cannot be neglected, so important that it must be conducted with the greatest care; and since you have it in your power to appoint a general to conduct it, in whom there is the most perfect knowledge of war, the most extraordinary valour, the most splendid personal influence, and the most eminent good fortune, can you hesitate, O Romans, to apply this wonderful advantage which is offered you and given you by the immortal gods, to the preservation and increase of the power of the republic? </p>                        </div>

But now, when to all the other exceeding advantages of the appointment, this opportunity is also added — that he is in those very countries already — that he has an army with him — that there is another army there which can at once be made over to him by those who are in command of it — why do we delay? or why do we not, under the guidance of the immortal gods themselves, commit this royal war also to him to whom all the other wars in those parts have been already entrusted to the greatest advantage, to the very safety of the republic? <br />[51]But, to be sure, that most illustrious man, Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, a man most honestly attached to the republic, and loaded with your kindness in a way most honourable to him; and also Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, a man endowed with the highest qualities of honour, and fortune, and virtue, and genius, disagree to this proposal. And I admit that their authority has in many instances had the greatest weight with you, and that it ought to have the greatest weight; but in this cause, although you are aware that the opinions of many very brave and illustrious men are unfavourable to us, still it is possible for us, disregarding those authorities, to arrive at the truth by the circumstances of the case and by reason. And so much the more easily, because those very men admit that everything which has been said by me up to this time is true — that the war is necessary, that it is an important war, and that all the requisite qualifications are in the highest perfection in Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. [52] What, then, does <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> say? “That if the whole power must be given to one man, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> alone is most worthy to have it, but that, nevertheless, the power ought not to be entrusted to one individual.” That argument, however, has now become obsolete, having been refuted much more by facts than by words. For you, also, Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, said many things with great force and fluency (as might be expected from your exceeding ability, and eminent facility as an orator) in the senate against that brave man, Aulus <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, when he had brought forward the law about appointing one commander-in-chief against the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>; and also from this place where I now stand, you made a long speech against that law. [53] What then? By the immortal gods, if your authority had had greater weight with the Roman people than the safety and real interests of the Roman people itself, should we have been this day in possession of our present glory, and of the empire of the whole earth? Did this, then, appear to you to be dominion, when it was a common thing for the ambassadors, and praetors, and quaestors of the Roman people to be taken prisoners? when we were cut off from all supplies, both public and private, from all our provinces? when all the seas were so closed against us, that we could neither visit any private estate of our own, nor any public domain beyond the sea? </p>                        </div>

We, who formerly had not only all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> in safety, but who were able by the authority of our empire to secure the safety of all our allies in the most distant countries, so that even the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, situated so far from us in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=demonym long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> sea, at which all men were in the habit of touching with their merchandise and their freights, full of riches as it was, little and unwalled as it was, still was in no alarm; we, I say, were cut off, not only from our provinces, and from the sea-coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and from our harbours, but even from the <a href=/people/1420 target=_blank>Appian</a> road; and at this time, the magistrates of the Roman people were not ashamed to come up into this very rostrum where I am standing, which your ancestors had bequeathed to you adorned with nautical trophies, and the spoils of the enemy's fleet. </p>                        </div>

But still, in a matter affecting the safety of the commonwealth, the Roman people preferred consulting its own feelings of indignation to your authority. Accordingly, one law, one man, and one year, delivered us not only from that misery and disgrace, but also caused us again at length to appear really to be the masters of all nations and countries by land and sea. [57] And on this account the endeavour to detract, shall I say from <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, or from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, or (what would be truer still) from both? appears to me particularly unworthy; being done in order that <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> might not be appointed lieutenant to Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, though he requested and begged it. Is he who begs for a particular lieutenant in so important a war unworthy to obtain any one whom he desires, when all other generals have taken whatever lieutenants they chose, to assist them in pillaging the allies and plundering the provinces? or ought he, by whose law safety and dignity has been given to the Roman people, and to all nations, to be prevented from sharing in the glory of that commander and that army, which exists through his wisdom and was appointed at his risk? [58] Was it allowed to Caius Falcidius, to Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, to Quintus <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> Laterensis, and to Cnaeus <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, all of whom I name to do them honour, to be lieutenants the year after they had been tribunes of the people; and shall men be so exact in the case of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> alone, who, in this war which is carried on under the provisions of the Gabinian law, and in the case of this commander and this army which he himself appointed with your assistance, ought to have the first right of any one? And concerning whose appointment as lieutenant I hope that the consuls will bring forward a motion in the senate; and if they hesitate, or are unwilling to do so, I undertake to bring it forward myself; nor, O Romans, shall the hostile edict of any one deter me from relying on you and defending your privileges and your kindness. Nor will I listen to anything except the interposition of the tribunes; and as to that, those very men who threaten it, will, I apprehend, consider over and over again what they have a right to do. In my own opinion, O Romans, <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> alone has a right to be put by the side of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> as a partner of the glory of his exploits in the maritime war; because the one, with the assistance of your votes, gave to that man alone the task of undertaking that war, and the other, when it entrusted to him, undertook it and terminated it. </p>                        </div>

In truth he is such a man, that no affair can be so important, or so difficult, that, he cannot manage it by his wisdom, or defend it by his integrity, or terminate it by his valour. But, in this case, I entirely differ from him; because, the less certain and the less lasting the life of man is, the more ought the republic to avail itself of the life and valour of any admirable man, as long as the immortal gods allow it to do so. [60] But let no innovation be established contrary to the precedents and principles of our ancestors. — I will not say, at this moment, that our ancestors in peace always obeyed usage, but in war were always guided by expediency, and always accommodated themselves with new plans to the new emergencies of the times. I will not say that two most important wars, the Punic war and the Spanish war, were put an end to by one general; that two most powerful cities, which threatened the greatest danger to this empire — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418000UNum class=place long=-2.4442 lat=41.8095>Numantia</a>, were destroyed by the same <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>. I will not remind you that it was but lately determined by you and by your ancestors, to rest all the hopes of the empire on Caius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, so that the same man conducted the war against <a href=/people/1161 target=_blank>Jugurtha</a>, and against the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a>, and against the <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutones</a>. But recollect, in the case of Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> himself, with reference to whom <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> objects to having any new regulations introduced, how many new laws have been made with the most willing consent of Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>. </p>                        </div>

He levied one. — To command it? He did command it. — To succeed gloriously in his undertaking? He did succeed. What can be so entirely contrary to usage, as for a very young man, whose age 7 fell far short of that required for the rank of a senator, to have a command and an army entrusted to him? to have <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> committed to his care, and Africa, and the war which was to be carried on there? He conducted himself in these provinces with singular blamelessness, dignity, and valour; he terminated a most serious war in Africa, and brought away his army victorious. But what was ever so unheard of as for a Roman knight to have a triumph? But even that circumstance the Roman people not only say, but they thought that it deserved to be thronged to and honoured with all possible zeal. [62] What was ever so unusual, as, when there were two most gallant and most illustrious consuls, for a Roman knight to be sent as proconsul to a most important and formidable war? He was so sent — on which occasion, indeed, when some one in the senate said that a private individual ought not to be sent as proconsul, Lucius <a href=/people/10987 target=_blank>Philippus</a> is reported to have answered, that if he had his will he should be sent not for one consul, but for both the consuls. Such great hope was entertained that the affairs of the republic would be prosperously managed by him, that the charge which properly belonged to the two consuls was entrusted to the valour of one young man. What was ever so extraordinary as for a man to be released from all laws by a formal resolution of the senate, and made consul before he was of an age to undertake any other magistracy according to the laws? What could be so incredible, as for a Roman knight to celebrate a second triumph in pursuance of a resolution of the senate? All the unusual circumstances which in the memory of man have ever happened to all other men put together, are not so many as these which we see have occurred in the history of this one man. [63] And all these instances, numerous, important and novel as they are, have all occurred in the case of the same man, taking their rise in the authority of Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> himself and by that of other most honourable men of the same rank. </p>                        </div>

Especially when the Roman people can now, of its own right, defend its own authority with respect to this man against all who dispute it — because, when those very same men objected, you chose him alone of all men to appoint to the management of the war against the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>. [64] If you did this at random, and had but little regard for the interests of the republic, then they are right to endeavour to guide your party spirit by their wisdom; but if you at that time showed more foresight in the affairs of the state than they did; if you, in spite of their resistance, by yourselves conferred dignity on the empire, safety on the whole world; then at last let those noble men confess that both they and all other men must obey the authority of the universal Roman people. And in this Asiatic and royal war, not only is that military valour required, which exists in a singular degree in Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, but many other great virtues of mind are also demanded. It is difficult for your commander-in-chief in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and all the kingdoms of the inland nations, to behave in such a manner as to think of nothing else but the enemy and glory. Then, even if there be some men moderate and addicted to the practice of modesty and self-government, still, such is the multitude of covetous and licentious men, that no one thinks that these are such men. It is difficult to tell you, O Romans, how great our unpopularity is among foreign nations, on account of the injurious and licentious behaviour of those whom we have of late years sent among them with military command. [65] For, in all those countries which are now under our dominion, what temple do you think has had a sufficiently holy reputation, what city has been sufficiently sacred, what private house has been sufficiently closed and fortified, to be safe from them? They seek out wealthy and splendid cities to find presence for making war on them for the sake of plundering them. [66] I would willingly argue this with those most eminent and illustrious men, Quintus <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>; for they know the distresses of the allies, they see their calamities, they hear their complaints. Do you think that you are sending an army in defence of your allies against their enemies, or rather, under presence of the existence of enemies, against your allies and friends themselves? What city is there in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> which can stand the ferocity and arrogance, I will not say of the, army, of a commander-in-chief, or of a lieutenant, but of even the brigade of one single military tribune? </p>                        </div>

Do you think that there is any city there peacefully inclined towards us which is rich? [67] Do you think that there is any rich city there, which will appear to those men to be peacefully inclined towards us? The sea-coast, O Romans, begged for Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, not only on account of his renown for military achievements, but also because of the moderation of his disposition. For it saw that it was not the Roman people that was enriched every year by the public money, but only a few individuals, and that we did nothing more by the name of our fleets beyond sustaining losses, and so covering ourselves with additional disgrace. But now, are these men, who think that all these honours and offices are not to be conferred on one person, ignorant with what desires, with what hope of retrieving past losses, and on what conditions, these men go to the provinces? As if Cnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> did not appear great in our eyes, not only on account of his own positive virtues, but by a comparison with the vices of others. [68] And, therefore, do not you doubt to entrust everything to him alone, when he has been found to be the only man for many years whom the allies are glad to see come to their cities with an army. And if you think that our side of the argument, O Romans, should be confirmed by authorities, you have the authority of Publius <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, a man of the greatest skill in all wars, and in affairs of the greatest importance, who has performed such mighty achievements by land and sea, that, when you are deliberating about war, no one's authority ought to have more weight with you. You have the authority of Caius <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, a man who has received great kindnesses from you, who has performed great exploits, who is endued with the highest abilities and wisdom; and of Cnaeus <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, in whom all of you know there is (as, indeed, there ought to be from the ample honours which you have heaped upon him) the most eminent wisdom, and the greatest dignity of character; and of Caius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, a man of extraordinary integrity, and valour, and virtue.

And in the second place, I exhort you, having the approbation of the Roman people, to persevere in those sentiments, and not to fear the violence or threats of any one. And, first of all, I think you have the requisite courage and perseverance; and, secondly, when we see such a multitude present displaying such zeal in our cause as we now see displayed for the second time, in appointing the same man to the supreme command how can we doubt in the matter, or question our power of carrying our point? As for me, all the zeal, and wisdom, and industry, and ability of which I am possessed, all the influence which I have through the kindness shown for me by the Roman people, and through my power as praetor, as also, through my reputation for authority, good faith, and virtue, all of it I pledge to you and the Roman people, and devote to the object of carrying this resolution.

[71] Wherefore, whatever I have undertaken in this cause, O Romans, I assure you that I have undertaken wholly for the sake of the republic; and I am so far from thinking that I have gained by it the favour of any influential man, that I know, on the other hand, that I have brought on myself many enmities, some secret, some undisguised, which I never need have incurred, and which get will not be mischievous to you.
