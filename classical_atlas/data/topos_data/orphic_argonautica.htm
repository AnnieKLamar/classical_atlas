One dropped her flute; another dropped her tortoise-shell lyre from her hands. They groaned deeply since they had come to their sad fate and their destined death. They threw themselves headlong from the heights down to the depths of the unquiet sea, in which their bodies and distinguished forms were changed into rocks. Even after evading this fate, swift <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> finished her passage through wave and bending sea, and the wind, blowing against the forestay and the stern, drove us to divine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>, where lived a race of skilled oarsman and seafarers, the <a href=/people/629 target=_blank>Phaeacians</a>.
