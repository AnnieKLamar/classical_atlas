He by his presence will safeguard the soldiers in the camp, civil rights in the forum, law-suits at the bar of judgement, and the dignity of the council-chamber, and he will preserve for each one his own personal possessions; he is a man at whom I marvel above all others and well deserving of the office of prince, and for him, I hope, you will render me thanks. 10 If, however, I have erred in my judgement concerning him, you may rest assure days that nowhere in the world will a man be found who can win complete approval. 11 Upon his son, <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> by name, a young man who will show himself worthy of his father's character, I have bestowed the tribuneship of the <a href=/people/12040 target=_blank>Vocontii</a>. </p>                        </div>

Then he was slain by his soldiers because he exacted too much labour. <br />5 And so, while <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> was bringing ruin on the commonwealth, there arose in Gaul first <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, then <a href=/people/3622 target=_blank>Lollianus</a>, next <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a>, and finally <a href=/people/11062 target=_blank>Tetricus</a> (for of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> we will make no mention), all of them defenders of the renown of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 6 All of these, I believe, were given by gift of the gods, in order that, while that pestiferous fellow was caught in the toils of unheard-of excesses, no opportunity might be afforded the Germans for seizing Roman soil. 7 For if they had broken forth then in the same manner as did the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, these foreign nations, acting together in Roman territory, would have put an end to this venerable empire of the Roman nation. 8 As for <a href=/people/3622 target=_blank>Lollianus</a>, his life is obscure in many details, as is also that of <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, too — but only their private lives; for while they lived they were famed for their valour, not for their importance in rank. </p>                        </div>

He also, because he devoted his time to seducing the wives of his soldiers and officers, was slain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/509070UCol class=place long=6.9582 lat=50.9413>Agrippina</a> through a conspiracy formed by a certain clerk, whose wife he had debauched; his mother Vitruvia, or rather Victoria, who was later called Mother of the Camp, had given his son <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a> the title of Caesar, but the boy, too, was immediately killed after his father was slain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/509070UCol class=place long=6.9582 lat=50.9413>Agrippina</a>. <br />4 Concerning <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a>, because he was most valiant and, save for his lustfulness, an excellent emperor, many details have been related by many writers. 5 We, however, deem it sufficient to insert a portion of the book of a certain <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> Atherianus, in which he writes of <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a> as follows: 6 With regard to <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a>, who ruled the provinces of Gaul after <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, I consider that no one should be given a higher place, not <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> for his courage, or <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> for his kindness, or <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> for his noble dignity, or <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> for his care of the treasury, or yet <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> or <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> for the strictness of their whole lives or the severity of their military discipline. 7 All these qualities, however, were offset to such an extent by his lustfulness and his desire for the pleasures gotten from women that no one would dare to set forth in writing the virtues of one who, all are agreed, deserved to be punished. 8 And so, since this is the judgement that writers have given concerning <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a>, I consider that I have said enough regarding his character. </p>                        </div>

For, just as that consul who held the office as a substitute for six hours at midday was ridiculed by <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> in the jest, We have had a consul so stern and severe that during his term of office no one has breakfasted, no one has dined, and no one has slept, so the same, it would seem, can be said of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, who on the first day was made emperor, on the second seemed to rule, and on the third was slain. <br />3 He was, indeed, an active man and rose through the various grades of military service to the imperial power itself — this one whom many called <a href=/people/6638 target=_blank>Mamurius</a> and some <a href=/people/1519 target=_blank>Veturius</a>, because, forsooth, he was a worker in iron. 4 But we have already said too much about this man, concerning whom it will be sufficient to add that there was no one whose hands were stronger, for either striking or thrusting, since he seemed to have not veins in his fingers, but sinews. 5 For he is said to have thrust back on-coming waggons by means of his forefinger and with a single finger to have struck the strongest men so hard that they felt as much pain as though hit by a blow from wood or blunted iron; and he crushed many objects by the mere pressure of two of his fingers. 6 He was slain by a soldier whom, because he had once been a worker in his smithy, he had treated with scorn either when he commanded troops or after he had taken the imperial power. 7 His slayer is said to have added the words, This is a sword which you yourself have forged. <br />8 His first public harangue, it is said, was as follows: I know well, fellow-soldiers, that I can be taunted with my former trade, of which all of you are my witnesses. 9 However, let anyone say what he wishes. As for me, may I always labour with steel rather than ruin myself with wine and garlands and harlots and gluttony, as does <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, unworthy of his father and the noble rank of his house. 10 Let men taunt me with working with steel as long as foreign nations shall know from their losses that I have handled the steel. 11 In short, I will strive to the utmost that all Alamannia and <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> and the nations round about shall deem the Roman people a steel-clad folk and that it shall be most of all the steel that they fear in us. 12 But as for you, I wish you to rest assured that you have chosen as emperor one who will never know how to deal with aught but the steel. 13 And this I say because I know that no charge can be brought against me by that pestiferous profligate save this, that I have been a forger of swords and armour. </p>                        </div>

For he left none exempt from his cruelty, and so brutal and savage was he, that in many communities he left not a single male alive. 4 It is said of Ingenuus, indeed, that when the city was captured, he threw himself into the water, and so put an end to his life, that he might not fall into the power of the brutal tyrant. <br />5 There is, indeed, still in existence a letter of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, written to <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a> Verianus, which shows his excessive brutality.

You will not satisfy me if you kill only armed combatants, for these even chance could have killed in the war. 7 You must slay every male, that is, if old men and immature boys can be put to death without bringing odium upon us. 8 You must slay all who have wished me ill, slay all who have spoken ill of me, the son of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, the father and brother of so many princes. 9 Ingenuus has been created emperor!

And so Regalianus, who held the command in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, was declared emperor, the prime movers being the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440205RMys class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=44>Moesians</a>, who had previously been defeated with Ingenuus and on whose kinsmen <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> had vented his anger severely. 2 He, indeed, performed many brave deeds against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a>, but nevertheless, at the instigation of the <a href=/people/3954 target=_blank>Roxolani</a> and with the consent of the soldiers and the provincials, who feared that <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> might, on a second occasion, act even more cruelly, he was put to death. <br />3 It may perhaps seem a matter for wonder if I relate the origin of his rule, for it was all because of a notable jest that he gained the royal power. 4 For when some soldiers were dining with him and a certain acting-tribune arose and said, Whence shall we suppose that Regalianus gets his name? another replied at once, I suppose from his regal power. 5 Then a schoolmaster who was present among them began, as it seemed, to decline grammatically, saying, Rex, regis, regi, Regalianus, 6 whereupon among the soldiers — a class of men who are quick to express what they have in mind — one cried out, So, then, can he be regal? another, So, then, can he hold regal sway over us? and again another, God has given you a regent's name. 7 Why should I then say more? The next day after these words were spoken, on going forth in the morning he was greeted as emperor by the front-line troops. Thus what was offered to others through daring or reasoned choice was offered to him through a clever jest. <br />8 It cannot, indeed, be denied that he had always won approbation in warfare and had long been suspected by <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> because he seemed worthy to rule; he was, moreover, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/445250RDac class=person long=25 lat=44.5>Dacian</a> by birth and a kinsman, so it was said, of <a href=/people/11091 target=_blank>Decebalus</a> himself. 9 There is still in existence a letter written by the Deified <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, then still a commoner, in which he expresses his thanks to Regalianus, as general in command of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, for recovering this district, at a time when <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>' slothfulness was bringing all things to ruin. This letter, which I have found in the original form, I think should be inserted here, for it was written officially: <br />10 From <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> to Regalianus many greetings. Fortunate is the commonwealth, which has deserved to have such a man as yourself in its military camps, and fortunate is <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, though no one tells him the truth about either good men or bad. 11 Word has been brought to me by Bonitus and <a href=/people/3007 target=_blank>Celsus</a>, the attendants of our emperor, how you conducted yourself in fighting at Scupi and how many battles you fought in a single day and with what great speed. You were worthy of a triumph, did but the olden times still remain. 12 But why say more? I could wish that you might be mindful of a certain person and therefore be more cautious in gaining victories. I should like you to send me some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=demonym long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatian</a> bows and two military cloaks, but provided with clasps, for I am sending you some of my own. <br />13 This letter shows what opinion of Regalianus was held by <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, whose judgement was without doubt most weighty in his own time. <br />14 It was not, indeed, from <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> that Regalianus received his promotion, but from his father, <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, as did also <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>, Ingenuus, <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> and <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a>, who all were slain while they held the imperial power, although they deserved to hold it. 15 It was, moreover, a matter for marvel in <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> as emperor, that all who were appointed commanders by him, afterwards, by the voice of the soldiers, obtained the imperial rule, so that it is clear that the aged emperor, in choosing the generals of the commonwealth, was, in fact, such an one as the felicity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — could it only have permitted by fate to continue under a worthy prince — ever required. 16 Oh that it might have been possible either for those who seized the imperial power to rule for a longer time, or for this man's son to rule less long, that somehow our commonwealth might have kept itself in its proper position! 17 But <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> claimed for herself too much indulgence, when with <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> she took away our righteous princes, and preserved <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> for the commonwealth longer than was meet. </p>                        </div>

Therefore, take this post which your merits deserve. My services as prefect shall be yours as long as you wish. Do you only serve the commonwealth well, so that the Roman world may rejoice that you have been made its prince. 7 To this <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> replied: I admit, Ballista, that to the wise man the imperial office is no light thing. For I wish, indeed, to come to the aid of the commonwealth and to remove that pestiferous fellow from administering the laws, but I am not of an age for this; I am now an old man, I cannot ride as an example to others, I must bathe too often and eat too carefully, and my very riches have long since kept me away from practicing war. 8 We must seek out some young men, and not one alone, but two or three of the bravest, who in different parts of the world of mankind can restore the commonwealth, which <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> and <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> have brought to ruin, the one by his fate, the other by his mode of life. 9 Whereupon Ballista, perceiving that <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>, in so speaking, seemed to have in mind his own two sons, answered him as follows: To your wisdom, then, we entrust the commonwealth. 10 And so give us your sons <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> and Quietus, most valiant young men, long since made tribunes by <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, for, under the rule of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, for the very reason that they are good men, they cannot remain unharmed. 11 Then <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>, finding out that his thoughts had been understood, replied: I will yield, and from my own funds I will present to the soldiers a double bounty. Do you but give me your zealous service as prefect and furnish rations in the needful places. I will now do my best that <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, more contemptible than any woman, may come to know his father's generals. 12 And so, with the consent of all the soldiers, <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> was made emperor, together with his two sons <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> and Quietus, and he immediately proceeded to march against <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, leaving affairs in the East in whatever state he could. 13 But while he was on the march, having with him a force of forty-five thousand soldiers, he met <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> or on the borders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, and there he was defeated and together with his son was slain. 14 Then thirty thousand of his men yielded to <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a>' power. It was <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitianus</a>, indeed, who won this victory, the bravest and most active of <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a>' leaders, who claimed to be the descendant of the Emperor <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> and Domitilla. <br />15 In writing of <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>, moreover, it would seem to me wrong to leave out the opinion of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, which he expressed in the message he sent to the senate from the frontier of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>. A portion of the message of the Deified <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>: 16 Being now engaged in the war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, Conscript Fathers, I have entrusted all public affairs, and even those which concern the war, to <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>.

He with his army will act as the case shall demand. 17 And in this, Conscript Fathers, there is nothing new or unexpected by us. For while a boy in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, while a youth in Gaul, while a mature man in Africa, and, finally, while well advanced in years in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a>, his valour has been well proved, for in divers battles he has done brave deeds which may serve as a pattern to others. 18 I will add, besides, that he has young sons, worthy of being our associates in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and worthy, too, of our friendship, and so forth. </p>                        </div>

This, in fact, has been officially decreed. <br />11 There is also another letter, in which he gives thanks to Ballista, showing that he himself had received from him instruction in governing the state, and expressing his pleasure that he had on his staff no supernumerary tribune (that is, one unassigned to some duty), no one in attendance who did not truly perform some office, and no soldier who was not truly a fighter. <br />12 This man, then, while resting in his tent was slain, it is said, by a certain common soldier, in order to gain the favour of <a href=/people/11043 target=_blank>Odaenathus</a> and <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>. 13 I, however, have not been able to find out sufficiently the truth concerning him, because the writers of his time have related much about his prefecture but little about his rule. </p>                        </div>

For he marched through the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/257326PThe class=place long=32.641 lat=25.684>Thebes</a> and, in fact, the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and to the best of his powers drove back the barbarians with courage and firmness. 7 Finally, he won by his merits the name of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, or else Alexandrinus — for this is considered uncertain. 8 But when he was making ready for a campaign against the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, the general <a href=/people/679 target=_blank>Theodotus</a> was sent against him by order of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, and so he suffered punishment, for it is related that, like the captives of old, he was strangled in prison. <br />9 Now, since I am speaking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, I think I must not fail to relate what the history of former times has suggested and, in connection therewith, a deed of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>. 10 For when he wished to confer proconsular power on <a href=/people/679 target=_blank>Theodotus</a>, the priests forbade it, saying that it was not lawful for the consular fasces to be brought into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. 11 This, we know well enough, was mentioned by <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> in his speech against <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, and, in fact, it is still remembered that this practice was maintained. 12 Therefore, your kinsman <a href=/people/1701 target=_blank>Herennius</a> <a href=/people/3007 target=_blank>Celsus</a>, in seeking the consulship, ought to know that what he desires is not lawful. 13 For at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, they say, it was written on a golden column in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> letters that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> would at last regain its freedom when the Roman fasces and the Roman bordered toga had been brought into the land. 14 This may be found in <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> the grammarian, the most learned man of his time, in the place where he tells of foreign countries. </p>                        </div>

For when some found fault with him, because he, the bravest of men, had led a woman in triumph, as though she were a general, he sent a letter to the senate and the Roman people, defending himself by the following justification: 5 I have heard, Conscript Fathers, that men are reproaching me for having performed an unmanly deed in leading <a href=/people/5320 target=_blank>Zenobia</a> in triumph. But in truth those very persons who find fault with me now would accord me praise in abundance, did they but know what manner of woman she is, how wise in counsels, how steadfast in plans, how firm toward the soldiers, how generous when necessity calls, and how stern when discipline demands. 6 I might even say that it was her doing that <a href=/people/11043 target=_blank>Odaenathus</a> defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and, after putting <a href=/people/12038 target=_blank>Sapor</a> to flight, advanced all the way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a>. 7 I might add thereto that such was the fear that this woman inspired in the peoples of the East and also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> that neither <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a> nor <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a> nor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> ever moved against her. 8 Nor would I have spared her life, had I not known that she did a great service to the Roman state when she preserved the imperial power in the East for herself, or for her children. 9 Therefore let those whom nothing pleases keep the venom of their own tongues to themselves. 10 For if it is not meet to vanquish a woman and lead her in triumph, what are they saying of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, in contempt of whom she ruled the empire well? 11 What of the Deified <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, that revered and honoured leader? For he, because he was busied with his campaigns against the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, suffered her, or so it is said, to hold the imperial power, doing it of purpose and wisely, in order that he himself, while she kept guard over the eastern frontier of the empire, might the more safely complete what he had taken in hand. 12 This speech shows what opinion <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> held concerning <a href=/people/5320 target=_blank>Zenobia</a>. <br />Such was her continence, it is said, that she would not know even her own husband save for the purpose of conception. For when once she had lain with him, she would refrain until the time of menstruation to see if she were pregnant; if not, she would again grant him an opportunity of begetting children. 13 She lived in regal pomp. It was rather in the manner of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> that she received worship and in the manner of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> kings that she banqueted; 14 but it was in the manner of a Roman emperor that she came forth to public assemblies, wearing a helmet and girt with a purple fillet, which had gems hanging from the lower edge, while its centre was fastened with the jewel called cochlis, used instead of the brooch worn by women, and her arms were frequently bare. 15 Her face was dark and of a swarthy hue, her eyes were black and powerful beyond the usual wont, her spirit divinely great, and her beauty incredible. So white were her teeth that many thought that she had pearls in place of teeth. 16 Her voice was clear and like that of a man. Her sternness, when necessity demanded, was that of a tyrant, her clemency, when her sense of right called for it, that of a good emperor. Generous with prudence, she conserved her treasures beyond the wont of women. 17 She made use of a carriage, and rarely of a woman's coach, but more often she rode a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>; it is said, moreover, that frequently she walked with her foot-soldiers for three or four miles. 18 She hunted with the eagerness of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=person long=-4 lat=39>Spaniard</a>. She often drank with her generals, though at other times she refrained, and she drank, too, with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, but only for the purpose of getting the better of them. 19 At her banquets she used vessels of gold and jewels, and she even used those that had been <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s. As servants she had eunuchs of advanced age and but very few maidens. 20 She ordered her sons to talk Latin, so that, in fact, they spoke Greek but rarely and with difficulty. 21 She herself was not wholly conversant with the Latin tongue, but nevertheless, mastering her timidity she would speak it; <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, on the other hand, she spoke very well. 22 In the history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> and the Orient she was so well versed that she even composed an epitome, so it is said; Roman history, however, she read in Greek. <br />23 When <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had taken her prisoner, he caused her to be led into his presence and then addressed her thus: Why is it, <a href=/people/5320 target=_blank>Zenobia</a>, that you dared to show insolence to the emperors of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? To this she replied, it is said: You, I know, are an emperor indeed, for you win victories, but <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> and <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a> and the others I never regarded as emperors. Believing Victoria to be a woman like me, I desired to become a partner in the royal power, should the supply of lands permit. 24 And so she was led in triumph with such magnificence that the Roman people had never seen a more splendid parade. For, in the first place, she was adorned with gems so huge that she laboured under the weight of her ornaments; 25 for it is said that this woman, courageous though she was, halted very frequently, saying that she could not endure the load of her gems. 26 Furthermore, her feet were bound with shackles of gold and her hands with golden fetters, and even on her neck she wore a chain of gold, the weight of which was borne by a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> buffoon. 27 Her life was granted her by <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, and they say that thereafter she lived with her children in the manner of a Roman matron on an estate that had been presented to her at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, which even to this day is still called <a href=/people/5320 target=_blank>Zenobia</a>, not far from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419128BVHa class=place long=12.7756 lat=41.9419>palace</a> of <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> or from that place which bears the name of Concha. </p>                        </div>

She was distinguished, furthermore, by her title, for she called herself Mother of the Camp. 3 Coins, too, were struck in her name, of bronze and gold and silver, and even to-day the type is still in existence among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/498066UCol class=ethnic long=6.644 lat=49.7597>Treviri</a>. 4 She did not, indeed, live long; for during <a href=/people/11062 target=_blank>Tetricus</a>' rule she was slain, some say, while others assert that she succumbed to the destiny of fate. <br />5 This is all that I have deemed worthy of being related concerning the thirty pretenders, all of whom I have gathered into one book, lest the telling of each single detail about each one singly might bring about an aversion that is undeserved and not to be borne by my readers. 6 Now I will return to the Emperor <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>. Concerning him I think I should publish a special book, short though it be, for his manner of life deserves it, and I must say something, besides, about that peerless man, his brother, in order that at least a few facts may be told of so righteous and noble a family. <br />7 It was with deliberate purpose that I included the women, namely that I might make a mock of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, a greater monster than whom the Roman state has never endured; now I will add two pretenders besides, supernumeraries, so to speak, for they lived each at a different period, since one was of the time of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, the other of the time of <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, my purpose being to include in this book the lives of thirty pretenders. 8 I ask you, accordingly, you who have received this book now completed, to look on my plan with favour and to consent to add to your volume these two, whom I had purposed to include after <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> and <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> among those who lived between <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> and <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a>, just as I included the elder <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> in this present book. 9 This error on my part, however, your accurate learning, mindful of history, prevented. 10 And so I am grateful that the kindliness of your wisdom has filled out my title. Now no one in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SPax class=place long=12.4875 lat=41.8929>Temple of Peace</a> will say that among the pretenders I included women, female pretenders, forsooth, or, rather, pretendresses — for this they are wont to bandy about concerning me with merriment and jests. 11 They have now the number complete, gathered into my writings from the secret stores of history. For 12 I will add to my work <a href=/people/3477 target=_blank>Titus</a> and <a href=/people/2605 target=_blank>Censorinus</a>, the former of whom, as I have said, lived under <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> and the latter under <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, but both were slain by the very soldiers who clothed them with the purple. </p>                        </div>

He reigned, however, for the space of six months. 2 He was one who especially deserved the praise of the commonwealth both at home and abroad, but in his ruling he had ill-fortune. 3 Some say, on the other hand, that he was made emperor by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> bowmen, whom <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> hated as devoted to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and to whom he had given offence. 4 You will not, indeed, wonder that there is such diversity of statement about this man, for even his name is scarcely known. 5 His wife was <a href=/people/2393 target=_blank>Calpurnia</a>, a revered and venerated woman of the stock of the Caesonini (that is, of the Pisos), to whom our fathers did reverence as a priestess married but once and among the most holy of women, and whose statue we have seen still standing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVeG class=place long=12.4848 lat=41.8941>Temple</a> of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, its head, hands and feet made of marble but the rest of it gilded. 6 She is said to have owned the pearls that once belonged to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> and a silver platter weighing a hundred pounds, of which many poets have made mention and on which was shown wrought in relief the history of her forefathers. <br />7 I seem to have gone on further than the matter demanded.
