After they had distributed the whole property on this basis, <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III), the son of <a href=/people/640 target=_blank>Proxenus</a>, eventually came and alleged that he had been adopted as heir to the whole property; he won his case and took possession, in addition to his own share, of the two-thirds which had been held by the sisters of the deceased. At a still later date the sons of the sisters brought a successful action against <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III), and he agreed to hand back to them the two-thirds clear and free of all charges, <a href=/people/2002 target=_blank>Leochares</a> acting as surety for the performance of this promise. In the present suit, as <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III) and <a href=/people/2002 target=_blank>Leochares</a> repudiate their agreement, the sons of the sisters claim the two-thirds from <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III), as having agreed to restore the property, and from <a href=/people/2002 target=_blank>Leochares</a> as surety. The discussion turns on a question of fact; for the adversaries deny their engagement. <br />We thought, gentlemen, that in the matter of our dispute with <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III) the agreement arrived at in court would be conclusive; for when <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III) gave up the two-thirds of the estate and furnished sureties that he would hand over that portion to us without dispute, we reciprocally abandoned our claims. But, gentlemen, since <a href=/people/7597 target=_blank>Dicaeogenes</a> (III) does not perform his agreement, we are bringing an action against <a href=/people/2002 target=_blank>Leochares</a>, his surety, in accordance with our affidavit.</p>                        </div>
