You were conning over something as you walked, your lips working and muttering, your hand flung out this way and that as you got a speech into order in your mind; you were doubtless inventing one of your crooked questions, or pondering some tricky problem; never a vacant mind, even in the streets; always on the stretch and in earnest, bent on advancing in your studies. <br />HERMOTIMUS: I admit the impeachment; I was running over the details of what he said in yesterday's lecture. One must lose no chance, you know; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=person long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Coan</a> doctor spoke so truly: ars longa, vita brevis . And what be referred to was only physic - a simpler matter. As to philosophy, not only will you never attain it, however long you study, unless you are wide awake all the time, contemplating it with intense eager gaze; the stake is so tremendous, too,- whether you shall rot miserably with the vulgar herd, or be counted among philosophers and reach <a href=/people/2309 target=_blank>Happiness</a>. </p>                        </div>

For twenty years now, I should say, I have watched you perpetually going to your professors, generally bent over a book taking notes of past lectures, pale with thought and emaciated in body. I suspect you find no release even in your dreams, you are so wrapped up in the thing. With all this you must surely get hold of <a href=/people/2309 target=_blank>Happiness</a> soon, if indeed you have not found it long ago without telling us. <br />HERMOTIMUS: Alas, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>, I am only just beginning to get an inkling of the right way. Very far off dwells <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>, as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says, and long and steep and rough is the way thither, and travellers must bedew it with sweat. <br />LYCINUS: And you have not yet sweated and travelled enough? <br />HERMOTIMUS: Surely not; else should I have been on the summit, with nothing left between me and bliss; but I am only starting yet, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>. </p>                        </div>

You may fairly be found guilty of laziness, if you cannot get it done by then; the time would allow you three return trips from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361000LPHe class=place long=-5.3464 lat=36.123>Pillars</a> of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, with a margin for exploring the tribes on the way instead of sailing straight and never stopping.

As it is, a good number begin the climb with great confidence, and do make progress, some very little indeed, others more; but when they get half-way, they find endless difficulties and discomforts, lose heart, and turn back, panting, dripping, and exhausted. But those who endure to the end reach the top, to be blessed thenceforth with wondrous days, looking down from their height upon the ants which are the rest of mankind. <br />LYCINUS: Dear me, what tiny things you make us out - not so big as the <a href=/people/10944 target=_blank>Pygmies</a> even, but positively grovelling on the face of the earth. I quite understand it; your thoughts are up aloft already. And we, the common men that walk the earth, shall mingle you with the Gods in our prayers; for you are translated above the clouds, and gone up whither you have so long striven. <br />HERMOTIMUS: If but that ascent might be, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>! but it is far yet. </p>                        </div>

You would never, of course, if there were any uncertainty of your life's lasting to the Virtue-point, slave and toil night and day like this; why, just as you were close to the top, your fate might come upon you, lay hold of you by the heel, and lug you down with your hopes unfulfilled. <br />HERMOTIMUS: God forbid! these are words of ill omen, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>; may life be granted me, that I may grow wise, and have if it be but one day of <a href=/people/2309 target=_blank>Happiness</a>! <br />LYCINUS: For all these toils will you be content with your one day? <br />HERMOTIMUS: Content? yes, or with the briefest moment of it. </p>                        </div>

It is not the way of such qualities to come out like that; they are hidden and secret; they are revealed only under long and patient observation, in talk and debate and the conduct they inspire.

Among the noteworthy things he told me, I seem to remember these: all the citizens are aliens and foreigners, not a native among them; they include numbers of barbarians, slaves, cripples, dwarfs, and poor; in fact anyone is admitted; for their law does not associate the franchise with income, with shape, size, or beauty, with old or brilliant ancestry; these things are not considered at all; anyone who would be a citizen needs only understanding, zeal for the right, energy, perseverance, fortitude and resolution in facing all the trials of the road; whoever proves his possession of these by persisting till he reaches the city is ipso facto a full citizen, regardless of his antecedents.

You agree? <br />HERMOTIMUS: Of course that is the only thing to do. <br />LYCINUS: Now, so far as promises and professions go, there is no lack of guides; there are numbers of them waiting about, all representing themselves as from there.

If he were to see an athlete getting his muscles in trim by kicking high, or hitting out at empty space as though he were getting a real blow home, would he (in the capacity of umpire) at once proclaim him victor, because he could not help winning ? No; he would reflect that these displays are easy and safe, when there is no defence to be reckoned with, and that the real decision must wait till he has beaten and mastered his opponent, and the latter 'has had enough'. Well then, do not let <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimus</a> suppose from his teachers' sparrings with our shadows (for we are not there) that they have the victory, or that our doctrines are so easily upset; tell him the business is too like the sand houses which children, having built them weak, have no difficulty in overturning, or, to change the figure, like people practising archery; they make a straw target, hang it to a post, plant it a little way off, and then let fly at it; if they hit and get through the straw, they burst into a shout, as if it were a great triumph to have driven through the dry stuff. That is not the way the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> take, or those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> tribes which use the bow. Generally, when they shoot, in the first place they are themselves mounted and in motion, and secondly, they like the mark to be moving too; it is not to be stationary, waiting for the arrival of the arrow, but passing at full speed; they can usually kill beasts, and their marksmen hit birds. If it ever happens that they want to test the actual impact on a target, they set up one of stout wood, or a shield of raw hide; piercing that, they reckon that their shafts will go through armour too. So, <a href=/people/1115 target=_blank>Lycinus</a>, tell <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimus</a> from us that his teachers fierce straw targets, and then say they have disposed of armed men; or paint up figures of us, spar at them, and, after a not surprising success, think they have beaten us.

At last a foreign woman who had a connexion with him dared to tell him; whereupon he went to his wife and scolded her for never having, with all her opportunities of knowing, warned him of it; she put in the defence that, as she had never been familiar or at close quarters with any other man, she had supposed all men were like that.

It is absolutely impossible to know which man to accuse of sacrilege; even if all the objects were similar, it would be uncertain who had robbed the God; for such things may be private property too. Our perplexity, of course, is simply due to the fact that the missing cup - assume it to be a cup - has no inscription; if either the God's or the donor's name had been on it, we should not have had all this trouble; when we found the inscribed one, we should have stopped stripping and inconveniencing other visitors.

A competitor comes up, makes a prayer to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, dips his hand into the urn, and pulls out one lot; then another does the same; there is a whip-bearer to each drawer, who holds his hand so that he cannot see what letter he has drawn. When all have drawn, the Alytarchos, I think it is, or one of the <a href=/people/5034 target=_blank>Hellanodikai</a> themselves - I cannot quite remember this detail -, goes round and examines the lots while they stand in a circle, and puts together the two alphas for the wrestling or pancratium, and so for the two betas, and the rest.

It is too late to carp at these details, when they come; they are consistent with the beginning; it was about that that the question ought to have been raised whether it was to be accepted and passed as true. Once grant that, and the rest comes flooding in, irresistible, hardly now susceptible of doubt, because it is consistent and accordant with your initial admissions. That is just your case; your love-yearning would not allow you to look into the facts at each entrance, and so you are dragged on by consistency; it never occurs to you that a thing may be self-consistent and yet false; if a man says twice five is seven, and you take his word for it without checking the sum, he will naturally deduce that four times five is fourteen, and so on ad libitum . This is the way that weird geometry proceeds: it sets before beginners certain strange assumptions, and insists on their granting the existence of inconceivable things, such as points having no parts, lines without breadth, and so on, builds on these rotten foundations a superstructure equally rotten, and pretends to go on to a demonstration which is true, though it starts from premisses which are false. </p>                        </div>

As to what you have sold us, you have got it still; your stock of learning is none the less; and in what I really sent the boy to you for, you have not improved him a bit; he has carried off and seduced neighbour <a href=/people/1996 target=_blank>Echecrates</a>'s daughter, and there would have been an action for assault, only <a href=/people/1996 target=_blank>Echecrates</a> is a poor man; but the prank cost me a couple of hundred. And the other day he struck his mother; she had tried to stop him when he was smuggling wine out of the house, for one of his club-dinners, I suppose. As to temper and conceit and impudence and brass and lying, he was not half so bad twelve months ago as he is now. That is where I should have liked him to profit by your teaching; and we could have done, without his knowing the stuff he reels of at table every day: 'a crocodile. seized hold of a baby,' says he, 'and promised to give it back if its father could answer'- the Lord knows what; or how, 'day being, night cannot be'; and sometimes his worship twists round what we say somehow or other, till there we are with horns on our heads! We just laugh at it - most of all when he stuffs up his ears and repeats to himself what he calls temperaments and conditions and conceptions and impressions, and a lot more like that. And he tells us God is not in heaven, but goes about in everything, wood and stone and animals - the meanest of them, too; and if his mother asks him why he talks such stuff, he laughs at her and says if once he gets the 'stuff' pat off, there will be nothing to prevent him from being the only rich man, the only king, and counting everyone else slaves and offscourings. </p>                        </div>

You should consider, he said, that if he had never come to me, he would have behaved far worse - very possibly have come to the gallows. As it is, philosophy and the respect he has for it have been a check upon him, so that you find he keeps within bounds and is not quite unbearable; the philosophic system and name tutor him with their presence, and the thought of disgracing them shames him. I should be quite justified in taking your money, if not for any positive improvement I have effected, yet for the abstentions due to his respect for philosophy; the very nurses will tell you as much: children should go to school, because, even if they are not old enough to learn, they will at least be out of mischief there. My conscience is quite easy about him; if you like to select any of your friends who is acquainted with <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoicism</a> and bring him here tomorrow, you shall see how the boy can question and answer, how much he has learnt, how many books he has read on axioms, syllogisms, conceptions, duty, and all sorts of subjects.

Perhaps you will say too that it is a good enough reason for pursuing it, if it will keep us from worse employments.

Why this obstinate silence? <br />HERMOTIMUS: Oh, why but that I could cry like a baby? It cuts me to the heart, it is all so true; it is too much for me, when I think of my wretched, wasted years - paying all that money for my own labour, too!

I may go as far as a fashionable coat, by way of publishing my renunciation of nonsense.
