                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2949.tlg001:493'><b>&sect; 493</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since from the descent of the presence of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, the unwearied and benevolent and mighty Shepherd and Teacher and Physician, I beheld and saw the ineffable and holy and unspotted mystery of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, who hold the hope in holiness, and who have been sealed; and since I have zealously served Him, I have deemed it necessary to give account of the mysteries which I have heard and seen. <br />I John, accompanying the holy apostles <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> and Paul, being formerly a servant of Cyrillus the high priest of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, but now having received the gift of the Holy Spirit through Paul and <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> and <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a>, who were worthy of the calling, and who baptized me in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Iconium</a>. After I was baptized, then, I saw a certain man standing clothed in white raiment; and he said to me: Be of good courage, John, for assuredly thy name shall be changed to Mark, and thy glory shall be proclaimed in all the world. And the darkness in thee has passed away from thee, and there has been given to thee understanding to know the mysteries of God. <br />And when I saw the vision, becoming greatly terrified, I went to the feet of <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, and related to him the mysteries which I had seen and heard from that man. And the Apostle Paul was not by when I disclosed the mysteries. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> said to me: Tell no one the miracle which thou hast seen. For by me also this night the Lord stood, saying, Be of good courage: for as thou hast given thy life for my name to death and banishment from thy nation, thus also shalt thou be made perfect. Moreover, as for the servant who is with you, take him also with thyself; for he has certain mysteries. Now then, my child, keep to thyself the things which thou hast seen and heard; for a time will come for thee to reveal them. <br />And I, having been instructed in these things by him, remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Iconium</a> many days; for there was there a holy man and a pious, who also entertained us, whose house also Paul had sanctified. Thence, therefore, we came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364339PSel class=place long=33.9165 lat=36.3765>Seleucia</a>, and after staying three days sailed away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; and I was ministering to them until we had gone round all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. And setting sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, we landed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370309PPer class=place long=30.856 lat=36.961>Perga</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>. And there I then stayed about two months, wishing to sail to the regions of the West; and the Holy Spirit did not allow me. Turning, therefore, I again sought the apostles; and having learned that they were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, I went to them. <br />And I found Paul in bed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> from the toil of the journey, who also seeing me, was exceedingly grieved on account of my delaying in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> coming, encouraged him, and tasted bread, and he took a little of it. And they preached the word of the Lord, and enlightened many of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> and Greeks. And I only attended to them, and was afraid of Paul to come near him, both because he held me as having spent much time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, and because he was quite enraged against me. And I gave repentance on my knees upon the earth to Paul, and he would not endure it. And when I remained for three Sabbaths in entreaty and prayer on my knees, I was unable to prevail upon him about myself; for his great grievance against me was on account of my keeping several parchments in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>. <br />And when it came to pass that they finished teaching in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, on the first of the week they took counsel together to set out for the places of the East, and after that to go into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and oversee all the churches in which they had spoken the word of God. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> entreated Paul to go first to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and oversee his own in his village; and Lucius entreated him to take the oversight of his city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>. And a vision was seen by Paul in sleep, that he should hasten to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, because the brethren expected him there. But <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> urged that they should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and pass the winter, and then that they should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> at the feast. Great contention, therefore, arose between them. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> urged me also to accompany them, on account of my being their servant from the beginning, and on account </p>                        </div>

But Paul cried out against <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, saying: It is impossible for him to go with us. And those who were with us there urged me also to accompany them, because there was a vow upon me to follow them to the end. So that Paul said to <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>: If thou wilt take John who also is surnamed Mark with thee, go another road; for he shall not come with us. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> coming to himself, said: The grace of God does not desert him who has once served the Gospel and journeyed with us. If, therefore, this be agreeable to thee, Father Paul, I take him and go. And he said: Go thou in the grace of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and we in the power of the Spirit. <br />Therefore, bending their knees, they prayed to God. And Paul, groaning aloud, wept, and in like manner also <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, saying to one another: It would have been good for us, as at first, so also at last, to work in common among men; but since it has thus seemed good to thee, Father Paul, pray for me that my labour may be made perfect to commendation: for thou knowest how I have served thee also to the grace of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> that has been given to thee. For I go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and hasten to be made perfect; for I know that I shall no more see thy face, O Father Paul. And falling on the ground at his feet, he wept long. And Paul said to him: The Lord stood by me also this night, saying, Do not force <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> not to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, for there it has been prepared for him to enlighten many; and do thou also, in the grace that has been given to thee, go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> to worship in the holy place, and there it shall be shown thee where thy martyrdom has been prepared. And we saluted one another, and <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> took me to himself. <br />And having come down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355358PLao class=place long=35.7849 lat=35.52>Laodiceia</a>, we sought to cross to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; and having found a ship going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, we embarked. And when we had set sail, the wind was found to be contrary. And we came to Corasium; and having gone down to the shore where there was a fountain, we rested there, showing ourselves to no one, that no one might know that <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> had separated from Paul. And having set sail from Corasium, we came to the regions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a>, and thence came to a certain island called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362338IPit class=place long=33.7631 lat=36.1844>Pityusa</a>; and a storm having come on, we remained there three days; and a certain pious man entertained us, by name <a href=/people/1508 target=_blank>Euphemus</a>, whom also <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> instructed in many things in the faith, with all his house. <br />And thence we sailed past the Aconesiae, and came to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360328PAne class=place long=32.803 lat=36.028>Anemurium</a>; and having gone into it, we found two Greeks. And coming to us, they asked whence and who we were. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> said to them: If you wish to know whence and who we are, throw away the clothing which you have, and I shall put on you clothing which never becomes soiled; for neither is there in it anything filthy, but it is altogether splendid. And being astonished at the saying, they asked us: What is that garment which you are going to give us? And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> said to them: If you shall confess your sins, and submit yourselves to our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, you shall receive that garment which is incorruptible for ever. And being pricked at heart by the Holy Spirit, they fell at his feet, entreating and saying: We beseech thee, father, give us that garment; for we believe in the living and true God whom thou proclaimest. And leading them down to the fountain, he baptized them into the name of Father, and Son, and <a href=/people/1595 target=_blank>Holy Ghost</a>. And they knew that they were clothed with power, and a holy robe. And having taken from me one robe, he put it on the one; and his own robe he put on the other. And they brought money to him, and straightway <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> distributed it to the poor. And from them also the sailors were able to gain many things. <br />And they having come down to the shore, he spoke to them the word of God; and he having blessed them, we saluted them, and went on board the ship. And the one of them who was named <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanus</a> wished to accompany us, and <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> did not permit him. And we, having gone across, sailed down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> by night; and having come to the place called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354329LKro class=place long=32.920278 lat=35.405278>Crommyacita</a>, we found <a href=/people/12262 target=_blank>Timon</a> and <a href=/people/313 target=_blank>Ariston</a> the temple servants, at whose house also we were entertained. <br />And <a href=/people/12262 target=_blank>Timon</a> was afflicted by much fever. And having laid our hands upon him, we straightway removed his fever, having called upon the name of the Lord Jesus. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> had received documents from <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a>, a book of the word of God, and a narrative of miracles and doctrines.

And <a href=/people/12262 target=_blank>Timon</a>, after he rose up from his disease, came with us.

He was of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350332PTam class=place long=33.2421855 lat=35.028422>Tamasus</a>, and had come to visit his relations; and <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, looking steadfastly at him, recognised him, having met with him formerly at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit class=place long=33.632745 lat=34.920211>Citium</a> with Paul; to whom also the Holy Spirit was given at baptism, and he changed his name to <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a>. And having ordained him bishop over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and having confirmed the church in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350332PTam class=place long=33.2421855 lat=35.028422>Tamasus</a>, we left him in the house of his brethren that dwelt there. <br />And having crossed the mountain called Chionodes, we came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347326PPal class=place long=32.5829 lat=34.7064>Old Paphos</a>, and there found <a href=/people/3684 target=_blank>Rhodon</a>, a temple servant, who also, having himself believed, accompanied us. And we met a certain <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a>, by name <a href=/people/6285 target=_blank>Barjesus</a>, coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348324PPap class=place long=32.407 lat=34.757>Paphos</a>, who also recognised <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, as having been formerly with Paul. He did not wish us to go into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/348324PPap class=place long=32.407 lat=34.757>Paphos</a>; but having turned away, we came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347329PKou class=place long=32.884 lat=34.666>Curium</a>. <br />And we found that a certain abominable race was being performed in the road near the city, where a multitude of women and men naked were performing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347329BKou class=place long=32.8763 lat=34.6912>race</a>. And there was great deception and error in that place. And <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> turning, rebuked it; and the western part fell, so that many were wounded, and many of them also died and the rest fled to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347329SApo class=place long=32.864 lat=34.673>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, which was close at hand in the city, which was called sacred. And when we came near the temple, a great multitude of <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who were there, having been put up to it by <a href=/people/6285 target=_blank>Barjesus</a>, stood outside of the city, and did not allow us to go into the city; but we spent the evening under a tree near the city, and rested there. <br />And on the following day, we came to a certain village where Aristoclianus dwelt. He being a leper, had been cleansed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, whom also Paul and <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> sealed to be a bishop, and sent to his village in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, because there were many Greeks there. And we were entertained in the cave by him in the mountain, and there we remained one day. And thence we came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/347331PAma class=place long=33.144 lat=34.712>Amathus</a> and there was a great multitude of Greeks in the temple in the mountain, low women and men pouring libations. There also <a href=/people/6285 target=_blank>Barjesus</a>, getting the start of us, gained over the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and did not allow us to enter into the city; but a certain widow woman, eighty years old, being outside of the city, and she also not worshipping the idols, coming forward to us, took us into her house one hour. And when we came out we shook the dust off our feet over against that temple where the libation of the abominable took place. <br />And having gone out thence, we came through desert places, and <a href=/people/12262 target=_blank>Timon</a> also accompanied us. And having come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit class=place long=33.632745 lat=34.920211>Citium</a>, and there being a great uproar there also in their hippodrome, having learned this, we came forth out of the city, having all shaken the dust off our feet; for no one received us, except that we rested one hour in the gate near the aqueduct. <br />And having set sail in a ship from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit class=place long=33.632745 lat=34.920211>Citium</a>, we came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, and landed in the so-called islands, where there was a place full of idols; and there there took place high festivals and libations. And having found <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> there again, we instructed him to proclaim the Gospel of God, and to set up churches, and ministers in them. And having gone into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, we came to the synagogue near the place called Biblia; and when we had gone into it, <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, having unrolled the Gospel which he had received from <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a> his fellow-labourer, began to teach the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. <br />And <a href=/people/6285 target=_blank>Barjesus</a>, having arrived after two days, after not a few <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had been instructed, was enraged, and brought together all the multitude of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>; and they having laid hold of <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a>, wished to hand him over to <a href=/people/4562 target=_blank>Hypatius</a>, the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>. And having bound him to take him away to the governor, and a pious Jebusite, a kinsman of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, having come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, learning this, took <a href=/people/1041 target=_blank>Barnabas</a> by night, and bound him with a rope by the neck; and having dragged him to the hippodrome from the synagogue, and having gone out of the city, standing round him, they burned him with fire, so that even his bones became dust. And straightway that night, having taken his dust, they cast it into a cloth; and having secured it with lead, they intended to throw it into the sea. But I, finding an opportunity in the night, and being able along with <a href=/people/12262 target=_blank>Timon</a> and <a href=/people/3684 target=_blank>Rhodon</a> to carry it. we came to a certain place, and having found a cave, put it down there, where the nation of the Jebusites formerly dwelt. And having found a secret place in it, we put it away, with the documents which he had received from <a href=/people/3629 target=_blank>Matthew</a>. And it was the fourth hour of the night of the second of the week. And when we were hid in the place, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> made no little search after us; and having almost found us, they pursued us as far as the </p>                        </div>
