I suppose you have forgotten him? <br />TH: Oh no, dear, I know; why, he shared our table last harvest festival. Well? you look as if you had something to tell me about him. <br />GLY: That wicked Gorgona (such a friend of mine, to be sure!)--she has stolen him away from me. <br />TH: What! he has given you up, and taken her in your place? <br />GLY: Yes, dear; isn't it horrid of her? <br />TH: Well, <a href=/people/1312 target=_blank>Glycera</a> darling, it is wicked, of course; but it is not very surprising; it is what all we poor girls do. You mustn't be too much vexed; I shouldn't blame her, if I were you; <a href=/people/7145 target=_blank>Abrotonum</a> never blamed you about him, you know; and you were friends, too. But I cannot think what he finds in her; where are his eyes? has he never found out how thin her hair is? what a lot of forehead she shows! and her lips! all livid; they might be a dead woman's; and that scraggy neck, veined all over; and what an amount of nose! I grant you she is tall and straight; and she has quite a nice smile. <br />GLY: Oh, <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>, you don't think it was her looks caught him. Don't you know? her mother Chrysarium is a witch; she knows <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> charms, and can draw down the moon; they do say she flies o' nights. It was she bewitched him with drugs in his drink, and now they are making their harvest out of him. <br />TH: Ah well, dear, you will get a harvest out of some one else; never mind him. </p>                        </div>

Doris <br />MYR: Well, <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>? So I hear you are to marry <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a> the shipmaster's daughter,--if you have not done so already! And this is the end of your vows and tears! All is over and forgotten! And I so near my time! Yes, that is all I have to thank my lover for; that, and the prospect of having a child to bring up; and you know what that means to us poor girls. I mean to keep the child, especially if it is a boy: it will be some comfort to me to call him after you; and perhaps some day you will be sorry, when he comes to reproach you for betraying <br />his poor mother. I can't say much for the lady's looks. I saw her only the other day, with her mother, at the <a href=/people/1058 target=_blank>Thesmophoria</a>; little did I know then that she was to rob me of my <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>! Hadn't you better see what she is like first? Take a good look at her eyes; and try not to mind the colour, and the cast (she has such a squint!). Or no: there is no need for you to see her: you have seen <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a>; you know what a face he has. <br />PA: How much more nonsense are you going to talk about shipowners and marriages? What do I know about brides, ugly or pretty? If you mean <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DAlo class=person long=23.75 lat=37.95>Alopeke</a>, I never knew he had a grown-up daughter at all. Why, now I think of it, he is not even on speaking terms with my father. They were at law not long ago--something about a shipping contract. He owed my father a talent, I think it was, and refused to pay; so he was had up before the Admiralty Court (nautodikai), and my father never got paid in full, after all, so he said. Do you suppose if I wanted to marry I should pass over <a href=/people/1623 target=_blank>Demeas</a>'s daughter in favour of <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a>'s? <a href=/people/1623 target=_blank>Demeas</a> was general last year, and she is my cousin on the mother's side. Who has been telling you all this? Is it just a cobweb spun in that jealous little brain of yours? <br />MYR: <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>! You mean to say you are not going to be married? <br />PA: Are you mad, or what is the matter with you? We did not have much to drink yesterday. <br />MYR: Ask Doris; it is all her fault. I sent her out to buy some wool, and to offer up prayer to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> for me. And she said that she met <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a>, and <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a>------Doris, tell him what <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a> said, unless you invented it all yourself. <br />DOR: May I die, miss, if I said a word more than the truth! Just by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPry class=place long=23.7307 lat=37.9709>Prytaneion</a> <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a> met me, and 'Doris,' says she, smiling, 'your young gentleman is to marry <a href=/people/1485 target=_blank>Philon</a>'s daughter. And if you don't believe me,' says she, 'look up their street, <br />and you will see everything crowned with garlands, and a fine bustle going on; flutes playing, and people singing the wedding-song' <br />PA: Well; and you did? <br />DOR: That I did, sir; and it was all as <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a> had said. <br />PA: Ah, now I see! You have told your mistress nothing but the truth; and there was some ground for what <a href=/people/9682 target=_blank>Lesbia</a> told you. However, it is a false alarm. The wedding is not at our house. I remember now. When I went back home yesterday, after leaving you, '<a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>,' said my mother, here is neighbour <a href=/people/5464 target=_blank>Aristaenetus</a>'s son, <a href=/people/1821 target=_blank>Charmides</a>, who is no older than you, just going to marry and settle down: when are you going to turn over a new leaf? ' And then I dropped off to sleep. I went out early this morning, so that I saw nothing of all that Doris has seen. If you doubt my word, Doris can go again; and look more carefully this time, Doris; mark the house, not the street only, and you will find that the garlands are next door. <br />MYR: I breathe again! <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a>, if it had been true, I should have killed myself! <br />PA: True, indeed! Am I mad, that I should forget Myrtium, so soon to become the mother of my child? </p>                        </div>

You were tipsy, he said, and made an exhibition of yourself, dancing when he asked you not to; then you kissed his friend <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a>, and when <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> did not like that, you left him and went and put your arms round <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a>; and he choking with rage all the time. And afterwards you would not go near him, but let him cry by himself, and kept singing and teasing him. <br />PHI: Ah, mother, he never told you how he behaved; if you knew how rude he was, you would not take his part. He neglected me and made up to <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>, <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a>'s girl, before <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a> came. I was angry, and let him see what I thought of him, and then he took hold of <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>'s ear, bent her neck back and gave her--oh, such a kiss! I thought it would never end. So I began to cry; but he only laughed, and kept whispering to her--about me, of course; <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a> was looking at me and smiling. However, when they heard <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a> coming, and had had enough of each other at last, I did take my place by him all the same, not to give him an excuse for a fuss afterwards. It was <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a> got up and danced first, showing her ankles ever so much, as if no one else had pretty ones. And when she stopped, <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a> never said a word, but <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> praised her to the skies--such perfect time! such varied steps! foot and music always right; and what a lovely ankle! and so on, and so on; it might have been the <a href=/people/5983 target=_blank>Sosandra</a> of <a href=/people/2214 target=_blank>Calamis</a> he was complimenting, and not <a href=/people/2353 target=_blank>Thais</a>; what she is really like, you know well enough. And how she insulted me, too! 'If some one is not ashamed of her spindle-shanks,' she said, 'she will get up and dance now.' Well, that is all, mammy; of course I did get up and dance. What was I to do? take it quietly and make her words seem true and let her be queen? <br />MOTHER: You are too touchy, my lass; you should have taken no notice. But go on. <br />PHI: Well, the others applauded, but <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> lay on his back and looked up at the ceiling, till I was tired and gave up. Mother. But what about kissing <a href=/people/1071 target=_blank>Lamprias</a>? is that true? and going across and embracing him? Well, why don't you speak? Those are things I cannot forgive. <br />PHI: I wanted to pay him out. <br />MOTHER: And then not sitting near him! singing while he was in tears! Think how poor we are, girl; you forget how much we have had from him, and what last winter would have been if <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> had not sent him to us. <br />PHI: I dare say! and I am to let him outrage my feelings just for that? <br />MOTHER: Oh, be as angry as you like, but no tit for tat. You ought to know that if a lover's feelings are outraged his love ends, and he finds out his folly. You have always been too hard on the lad; pull too tight, and the rope breaks, you know. </p>                        </div>

He and <a href=/people/6923 target=_blank>Simiche</a> are drinking at the house of his friend <a href=/people/1594 target=_blank>Pammenes</a>. <br />BACCHIS: That is terrible, <a href=/people/4203 target=_blank>Melitta</a>. But how did you happen to fall out? Undoubtedly it was not over a trifle. <br />MELITTA: I have nothing to say about that. The day before yesterday he returned from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a> where he went to collect a debt for his father. I ran up to him as he entered my house, but he refused to recognize me. I wanted to embrace him but he repelled me, saying: Get away from me! Run along to your shipowner <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a>! Or rather, see what is written on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XKer class=place long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Kerameikos</a> walls; you'll find there both of your names inscribed with a stylus. Which <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a>? I asked him in surprise. But without answering and without tasting a morsel of food, he got into bed and turned his back on me. I did everything I could think of to win his attention. I took him in my arms, I lay on top of him, I kissed him between the shoulders, on the lower section of his back, and put my hand between his legs. It was all in vain. Nothing could soften him, and he said: If you continue your maneuvers, I'll leave immediately, dark and late as it is! <br />BACCHIS: But you do know <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a>, don't you? <br />MELITTA: May I become even more miserable than I am at present if I know of a shipowner by the name of <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a>. <a href=/people/1990 target=_blank>Charinos</a> rose at daybreak and left without a word. I remembered what he had said about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XKer class=place long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Kerameikos</a> wall and I sent <a href=/people/8746 target=_blank>Akis</a> to see what was written. She found nothing more than an inscription, somewhere on the right, as you enter by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237FDip class=place long=23.719 lat=37.9786>Dipylon</a>. It went like this: <a href=/people/4203 target=_blank>Melitta</a> loves <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a>; and a little lower: The shipowner <a href=/people/2316 target=_blank>Hermotimos</a> loves <a href=/people/4203 target=_blank>Melitta</a>. <br />BACCHIS: What a dirty trick! I understand now. Somebody wrote the words on the wall in order to get even with <a href=/people/1990 target=_blank>Charinos</a>, knowing he is very jealous. He believed what he read without asking a question. If I saw him, I'd tell him about it. <br />MELITTA: But how can you see him? How can anybody see him? He has shut himself up with <a href=/people/6923 target=_blank>Simiche</a>. His parents came to my house to see if <a href=/people/1990 target=_blank>Charinos</a> was with me. Ah, if only I could find an old witch who would make the right kind of incantation. She'd save my life. <br />BACCHIS: Don't worry, my dear. I happen to be acquainted with an experienced witch. She is a Syrian, still in the prime of her career as a magician. You remember how <a href=/people/1636 target=_blank>Phanias</a> left me for no reason at all, just like <a href=/people/1990 target=_blank>Charinos</a> now? Well, this Syrian witch worked a reconciliation after four months' time. I was despairing of ever getting him back, and she, by the means of her enchantments, made him return to my bed. <br />MELITTA: What did the old woman do — if you do not fear telling me? <br />BACCHIS: Not at all. I'll tell you everything. You don't need to pay her very much, <a href=/people/4203 target=_blank>Melitta</a>, only one drachma and a loaf of bread. But you will have to bring along some salt, seven oboles, sulfur and a torch. The witch takes it all, and — oh, yes! You must bring some wine in a krater; the old woman will drink the wine. And you'll need something of the man himself as, for example, an article of clothing, a hair, or some such thing. <br />MELITTA: I still have his shoes. <br />BACCHIS: Well, she will hang them on a nail, burn the sulfur underneath and strew salt over the fire while she keeps repeating your name, your own and your lover's. Then she draws a top from between her breasts and spins it, reciting at the same time her secret charm. Oh, what secret, barbarian words! It'll make you shudder. That is what she did for me, and very soon <a href=/people/1636 target=_blank>Phanias</a> — in spite of the reproaches of his comrades and the pleading of the false <a href=/people/10074 target=_blank>Phoibis</a> — came back to my bed. It was the charm that made him return. It urged him on toward me. The same witch also taught me the way to make <a href=/people/10074 target=_blank>Phoibis</a> perfectly hateful. You watch the print of her feet as she passes by, and then you rub out the footprints by putting your right foot where she has placed her left foot and your left on her right. You do it and say at the same time: I have trampled on you; I am above you. I am above you. I have trampled on you; I am above you. I did exactly what she told me, and now <a href=/people/1636 target=_blank>Phanias</a> is back in my bed. And he passionately kisses me all over my body, something he always refused to do before. <br />MELITTA: Not a moment's delay, <a href=/people/1394 target=_blank>Bacchis</a>! Find me immediately the Syrian witch. And you, <a href=/people/8746 target=_blank>Akis</a>, prepare the bread and the sulfur and everything we shall need for a proper incantation. </p>                        </div>

People say <a href=/people/5775 target=_blank>Megilla</a>, the wealthy lady from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>, is in love with you, as if she were a man, and that she — I can't explain how — — — but — — — . I have heard it said that the two of you couple up just like — — — <br />LEAINA: (Abashed silence) <br />CLONARION: What's the matter? You are blushing. Is it true then? <br />LEAINA: It is true, <a href=/people/7525 target=_blank>Clonarion</a>. I am ashamed. It is so strange — — — <br />CLONARION: By the great <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrasteia</a>, you must tell me about it! What does that woman require of you? Exactly what do you do when you get into bed together? <br />LEAINA: (Abashed silence) <br />CLONARION: Now I am sure you don't love me. If you did, you would not think of hiding such things from me. <br />LEAINA: I do love you, <a href=/people/7525 target=_blank>Clonarion</a>. I love you more than anybody else. But this is such a strange matter. I am so ashamed. That woman is so terribly like a male. <br />CLONARION: I don't understand. Do you mean to say she is one of those man-like females of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a> who will not suffer in their beds the company of men, but prefer to find pleasure, instead, with other women, as if they themselves were men? <br />LEAINA: She is somewhat like that. <br />CLONARION: (With enthusiasm) In that case, <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>, tell me everything, please! How did she seduce you, in the first place? And how was it that you let <a href=/people/5775 target=_blank>Megilla</a> have her way with you? And what came after? Tell me everything, please! <br />LEAINA: You see, <a href=/people/5775 target=_blank>Megilla</a> and <a href=/people/2819 target=_blank>Demonassa</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a>, sweating and very hot, pulled off her false hair — I had never suspected her of wearing a wig. And I saw her head was smooth-shaven as that of a young athlete. I was quite scared to see this. But <a href=/people/5775 target=_blank>Megilla</a> spoke up and said to me: Tell me, O <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>, have you ever seen a better looking young man? But I see no young man here, <a href=/people/5775 target=_blank>Megilla</a>! I told her. Now, now! Don't you effeminate me! she reproved. You must understand my name is Megillos. <a href=/people/2819 target=_blank>Demonassa</a> is my wife. Her words seemed so funny to me, <a href=/people/7525 target=_blank>Clonarion</a>. I started to giggle. And I said: Can it be, Megillos, that you are a man and lived among us under the disguise of a woman, just like <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, who stayed among the girls hidden by his purple robe? And is it true that you possess a man's organs, and that you do to <a href=/people/2819 target=_blank>Demonassa</a> what any husband does to his wife? That <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>, she replied, is not entirely so. You will soon see how we shall couple up in a fashion that is much more voluptuous. In that case, I said, you are not a hermaphrodite. They, I have been told, have both a man's and woman's organs. No, she said, I am quite like a man. <a href=/people/2417 target=_blank>Ismenodora</a>, the Boeotian flute player, has told me about a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=demonym long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Theban</a> woman who was changed into a man. A certain good soothsayer by the name of <a href=/people/468 target=_blank>Teiresias</a> — — — Did any accident like that happen to you by chance? No, <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>, she said. I was born with a body entirely like that of all women, but I have the tastes and desires of a man. And do those desires of yours suffice you? I asked, smiling. Let me have my own way with you, <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>, if you don't believe me, she answered, and you will soon see that I have nothing to envy men for. I have something that resembles a man's estate. Come on, let me do what I want to do and you will soon understand. She pleaded so hard that I let her have her way. And you must understand that she made me a gift of a splendid necklace and several tunics of the finest linen. Then I embraced her and held her in my arms, as if she were a man. And she kissed me all over the body, and she set out to do what she had promised, panting excitedly from the great pleasure and desire that possessed her. <br />CLONARION: But exactly how did she manage it? What did she do? Tell me, <a href=/people/1948 target=_blank>Leaina</a>! Tell me especially that! <br />LEAINA: Please, don't ask me for details. These are shameful things. By the Mistress of Heaven, I will never, never, tell you that! </p>                        </div>

You have spent your first night with a man. You have earned your first gift, no less than a hundred drachmas. With that I'll buy you a necklace. <br />CORINNA: Yes, dear mother, do buy me a necklace. Let it be a necklace made of fine, shining stones like the one <a href=/people/1787 target=_blank>Philainis</a> wears. <br />CROBYLE: I promise. It will be just like the one <a href=/people/1787 target=_blank>Philainis</a> wears. But listen: I want to teach you how you should conduct yourself with men. Take my words to heart, daughter. We have only your favor with men to depend on for a living. You can't imagine how hard it has been for us to get along since your blessed father's death. We lacked nothing when he was alive. He had quite a reputation as a blacksmith in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>. People say there will never be another blacksmith like Philipinos. After his death I sold his tongs, anvil and hammer for two hundred drachmas. We lived on that for some time. I found work weaving and turning thread, barely earning enough to buy bread with. I have raised you, however, my precious little daughter. You are the only hope left me. <br />CORINNA: Weren't you going to say something about my hundred drachmas, mother? <br />CROBYLE: No, child. But I thought you were now big enough to support your tired mother. Not only that: you can even earn enough to dress richly, to buy yourself the newest robes of purple, and slaves. <br />CORINNA: What do you mean, mother? Why do you say that? <br />CROBYLE: Don't you understand, little fool? Why, you will earn a great deal being attentive to nice young men, drinking in their company and going to bed with them — for money, of course. <br />CORINNA: (Scandalized) You mean like Lyra, the daughter of <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a>? <br />CROBYLE: Yes. <br />CORINNA: But she is — a courtesan! <br />CROBYLE: What of it? There is no harm in that. You will become rich. You are sure to have many lovers. <br />CORINNA: (Weeps) <br />CROBYLE: Why, <a href=/people/2304 target=_blank>Corinna</a>! Why do you weep? Don't you see how many courtesans there are, how they are all sought after, and how they all make money? I knew <a href=/people/161 target=_blank>Daphnis</a> when she was in rags — that was before she got sense enough to make use of her body. Look at her now! She struts like a queen, all bespangled with gold, wearing flowery dresses, and no less than four slaves behind her. <br />CORINNA: And how did she get all that, dear mother? <br />CROBYLE: Well, in the first place, by dressing elegantly and being amiable and cheery with everybody. She does not giggle at any little thing, as you do; instead, she only smiles, which is much more attractive. She treats shrewdly, but without double-crossing, the men that come to see her or take her to their houses. She never approaches them first. When she is paid to assist at a banquet, she takes care not to get drunk — it is foolish and men can't bear it — and she does not stuff herself with food like an imbecile, so that when she gets into bed she is in condition to serve her lover well. She no more than touches the various dishes served — delicately, with her fingertips, and always in silence. And she never guzzles her wine, but drinks slowly, quietly, in gentle little sips. <br />CORINNA: But supposing she is thirsty, dear mother? <br />CROBYLE: Especially when she is thirsty, foolish girl! And she never speaks more than is necessary, and never pokes fun at anybody present, and has eyes only for the man who has paid her. That is why everybody appreciates her. Furthermore, when it is time to get into bed, she never resorts to any obscenity, but does her task with care and loving attention. In bed, she bears one thing in mind — to win the man and make a steady lover of him. That is why everybody speaks highly of her. If you take this lesson to heart and do likewise we, too, shall be rich, for she is far from having your looks and your complexion. But I won't say anything more. Long may you live, little daughter, and prosper! <br />CORINNA: But tell me, dear mother: Will all those that will pay me be as handsome as Eucritos, the fellow I slept with yesterday? <br />CROBYLE: Not all. There will be better looking fellows. And some will be very vigorous and energetic — you know what I mean; while others will not be quite as handsome. <br />CORINNA: And shall I have to give myself to the homely fellows too? <br />CROBYLE: Especially to them, my child. It is that class that pays best. The beautiful kind only want to give their looks. I repeat: be careful to attach yourself to men who pay best — if you want to have people point you out on the street and say: Do you see that <a href=/people/2304 target=_blank>Corinna</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/6395 target=_blank>Crobyle</a>? Do you notice how rich she became, and what happiness she brings to her old mother? Oh, thrice happy has she rendered her, blessed be the girl! What do you say, child? Will you do that? You'll do what your old mother tells you, won't you? Ah, you will easily surpass the best of our courtesans. Now run and wash yourself, child. Possibly little Eucritos will be back tonight. He has promised to come to my little daughter. Both of you will enjoy it more tonight. </p>                        </div>

For we shall be happy. Yes, thrice happy! You should understand by now how much we are ever likely to get from that young man. He hasn't given us a single obol, or one piece of clothing or a pair of slippers, and not a box of perfumes. His only stock in trade seems to be pretexts, promises and fine hopes. He is always mumbling: If my father ever and — — — I become master of the estate, everything, everything will be yours. You say he has sworn to marry you legally? <br />MOUSARION: He did, mother. He swore by the two goddesses and by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Pallas Athena</a>. <br />MOTHER: And you believe all that? Why, the other day, when he did not have enough money to pay a debt, you handed him your ring; you said nothing to me. And he traded it for a few drinks. Then followed both of your Ionic necklaces, each of which weighs no less than two darikes. The armorer <a href=/people/6850 target=_blank>Praxias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=person long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> had to send to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> to get them for you. Well, dear <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> had better start paying what he owes us. I won't say anything about your linen and shirts. Every lover naturally gives those things. But <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> isn't much of an asset as a lover. <br />MOUSARION: But he is so handsome. There isn't a sign of a hair on his chin. And he tells me he loves me and often weeps while he is saying that he loves me. Furthermore, he is the son of Dinomache and Lathes the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=person long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagite</a>. We shall get married as soon as the old man shuts his eyes for good. <br />MOTHER: (Ironically) Well, Mousarion. Whenever we are in need of shoes and the cobbler says, Two drachmas, please, we shall tell him, Sorry, we have no money, but won't you take a few fine hopes? And when the flour merchant presents his bill, we'll say, Wait. The old <a href=/people/1267 target=_blank>Laches</a> Collyetus will soon be dead. We shall pay after the marriage ceremony. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You are the only one among courtesans without a pair of earrings, without a necklace, or one <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=demonym long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentine</a> tunic? <br />MOUSARION: Why should I feel ashamed, mother? Are the other courtesans happier or better looking? <br />MOTHER: But they are more intelligent. They understand their business. They don't let their heads be turned by fine phrases and promises. You are faithful; you love <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> like a husband, you don't let another soul touch you. That is the trouble with you. The other day, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=demonym long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnian</a> farmer boy offered you two hundred drachmas, the full price of the wine he had sold for his father in the city, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=person long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Acharnian</a> had no hair on his chin, either, you laughed at the poor boy and lay down instead with <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a>, your <a href=/people/430 target=_blank>Adonis</a>. <br />MOUSARION: But, mother, you surely did not expect me to abandon <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> and receive in his place that peasant with his smell of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-dung? <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a>'s skin is so smooth and soft.

That was a rustic who smelled of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-dung. But what about <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/733 target=_blank>Menecrates</a>? Why didn't you receive <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a>? He offered you a hundred drachmas for the pleasure of one night? Isn't he handsome? Isn't he a man of the world? Isn't he citified? Is <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a> a day older than your dear little <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a>? <br />MOUSARION: But <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> says he will kill both of us if he ever finds him with me. <br />MOTHER: How those young fellows do threaten and boast! In that case, you will remain without lovers, you will become an honest woman. Why don't you forget that you are a courtesan and put on the dress of the priestesses of the Thesmophorion goddess? But let us leave that. Today is the day of Aloa, a feast of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>. What has your little darling given you for the holiday? <br />MOUSARION: Always you think and speak only of what he will give me. He gives me himself. Has any courtesan more? But — there mother, do not weep. His father has promised him a fine gift of money. <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaireas</a> promised to give whatever stipend he receives to me. He is generous. Have no fear, dear mother. <br />MOTHER: Let us hope it isn't more lying. Don't you forget my words, Mousarion. I'll have occasion to remind you of your folly. </p>                        </div>

And your eyes are red with crying. I have always known you as a cheerful girl. You, of all our friends, should be happy. For it is common gossip that <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> loves you with a love that is bestowed on few women. <br />CHRYSIS: Yes, that is just it. He loves me! But you would not have thought so had you seen him last night, in that insane fury that overcomes him when I but walk in the shadow of another man. No, had you seen him beating me last night, would you but see the marks of his lash on my body now, you would not think him such a lover. Lover indeed! He whips me with more fury than the meanest slave. <br />AMPELIS: But this fury is only another proof of his great love. You should he thankful, not complaining. <br />CHRYSIS: What are you saying? Must he always be beating me? <br />AMPELIS: No. But may he always get angry when your attention wanders to some other man! He must be crazy about you. If he weren't, he wouldn't have gotten excited when he saw you with another lover. <br />CHRYSIS: But I have no other lover. He imagines that I am in love with a rich old man just because I spoke to the fellow the other day. <br />AMPELIS: It is a very good thing that he thinks the rich are after you. The more he will suffer on account of that, the more he will try to rival them — you know how — so as not to be left behind. <br />CHRYSIS: Meanwhile, he raises Cain and whips me and gives me not an obol. <br />AMPELIS: He'll give. Jealous men are always liberal givers. <br />CHRYSIS: But, dearie, I don't see why he should keep on beating me. <br />AMPELIS: I am not saying that. I do know, however, that men become bigger-hearted and better lovers once they get the suspicion that their mistresses care less about them. When a man believes himself to be the one and only lover in a woman's life, he'll whistle and go his way. I ought to know; I have followed this profession for the last twenty years. If you want me to, I will tell you what happened to me a few years ago. At that time I had a steady lover, a certain <a href=/people/4505 target=_blank>Demophantos</a>, a lender living near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BSPo class=place long=23.72265 lat=37.97635>Poikile</a>. He had never given me more than five drachmas and he pretended to be my man. But his love was only superficial, <a href=/people/2508 target=_blank>Chrysis</a>. He never sighed, he never shed tears for me and he never spent the night waiting at my door. One day he came to see me, knocked at my door, but I did not open it. You see, I had the painter, <a href=/people/6319 target=_blank>Callides</a>, in my room; <a href=/people/6319 target=_blank>Callides</a> had given me ten drachmas. <a href=/people/4505 target=_blank>Demophantos</a> swore and beat his fists on the door and left cursing me. Several days passed without my sending for him; <a href=/people/6319 target=_blank>Callides</a> was still in my house. Thereupon <a href=/people/4505 target=_blank>Demophantos</a>, who was already quite excited, went wild. He broke open my door, wept, pulled me about, threatened to kill me, tore my tunic, and did everything, in fact, that a jealous man would do, and finally presented me with six thousand drachmas. In consideration of this sum, I was his for a period of eight months. His wife used to say that I had bewitched him with some powder. That bewitching powder, to be sure, was jealousy. That is why, <a href=/people/2508 target=_blank>Chrysis</a>, I advise you to act likewise with <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>. The boy will be rich if anything happens to his father. </p>                        </div>

We are lost! <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> is back from the war. He was wearing a purple cloak and was surrounded by many slaves. I did not get the opportunity to speak to him in person because, as soon as they caught sight of him, his friends rushed up to greet him. But I noticed at his side a person who had accompanied him abroad; you know whom I mean. And I asked the latter person: Tell me, <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a>, have you got something for us? Has your master brought any worth-while gift from the war? <br />PANNYCHIS: That was wrong. You shouldn't have used such words. You should have said instead: You are safe, praised be the gods, especially <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Dzeus</a> <a href=/people/5315 target=_blank>Xenios</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> <a href=/people/6953 target=_blank>Stratia</a>! The mistress has asked me to inquire how your master has gotten along and if both of you are in good health. And it would have sounded even better if you had added: She hasn't ceased weeping for <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> and thinking about him. That would have been much better. <br />DORCAS: Indeed, I did tell something like what you say as soon as I opened my mouth. But I didn't repeat my words, the exact words I used to <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a>, because I wanted to warn you immediately what I have learned. When I came near <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a>, I started this way: Is it possible, <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a>, that your own and your master's ears did not tingle all thru this war? For the mistress hasn't stopped talking about both of you. She has shed tears every day since you left. And whenever anybody returns from the battle area and there is news of a great fight and many are killed, she tears her hair and beats her breasts. Indeed, any kind of war news makes her lament. <br />PANNYCHIS: Very good, <a href=/people/3382 target=_blank>Dorcas</a>. You have spoken the right words. <br />DORCAS: Then I asked about gifts and such matters, and he replied: <a href=/people/3382 target=_blank>Dorcas</a>, we return in full magnificence. <br />PANNYCHIS: He did not begin by saying that <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> still remembers me and that he hopes to find me alive and awaiting him? <br />DORCAS: In fact, <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a> did mention several little things to that effect; but I found much more agreeable his account of his master's and his own good fortune. <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a> spoke at length of great riches, of gold, fine raiments and slaves and ivory. It appears that they have so much money that they don't count it by pieces but by medimnas, and many are the medimnas they have brought along. <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a> himself carries on his little finger a large polygonal ring in which is set a wonderful tri-colored stone. Before I left him, he tried to tell me how they had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416359WHal class=place long=35.883 lat=41.569>Halys</a> and killed a certain <a href=/people/1518 target=_blank>Tiridates</a>, and how <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> distinguished himself in a fight against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>. I ran to you to announce their return so that you may have time to decide what to do. Should <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> arrive and find <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a> here, he will ... Can you imagine what he might do? <br />PANNYCHIS: We must find some remedy for this queer situation. It would not be wise to desert <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a>; he gave me six thousand drachmas the other day. And, besides, he is a merchant; he may give me much more later. On the other hand, I can not refuse to receive <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> when he returns with so much money. One must respect old loves. This <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> is so jealous a man, it was hard to put up with him when he was poor. I can imagine what he will be like after such a successful war. <br />DORCAS: Here he comes! <br />PANNYCHIS: Oh, I am powerless! What shall I do? I can not think of a way out. Invent something, please. Invent a story immediately! I tremble, <a href=/people/3382 target=_blank>Dorcas</a>! I tremble! <br />DORCAS: And there is <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratos</a>, too! <br />PANNYCHIS: Oh, what will become of me! May the earth open its mouth and swallow me <br />PHILOSTRATOS: (Coming near) I suggest we have a drink, dear <a href=/people/5160 target=_blank>Pannychis</a>. <br />PANNYCHIS: (Low) Oh, miserable man, you have ruined me! (Loudly) Hail, <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>! Why didn't you return sooner? <br />POLEMON: Who is the man who dares to ask <a href=/people/5160 target=_blank>Pannychis</a> to drink with him? <br />PANNYCHIS: (Silent) <br />POLEMON: You are silent. Very well. I have exerted myself to make the journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylae</a> to this city in five days' time in order to see this woman! Many thanks! I must have merited such a reception. From now on you are free to sponge on somebody else. <br />PHILOSTRATOS: And you, friend, who are you? <br />POLEMON: What! You haven't heard of <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379240DSte class=person long=24.0107 lat=37.8982>Steirieus</a>, the Pandionid who was first a chiliarch and now commands his five thousand shields? <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a>, stranger, was the lover of this <a href=/people/5160 target=_blank>Pannychis</a> when he still credited her with human feelings. <br />PHILOSTRATOS: All right, my captain of mercenaries! Learn that <a href=/people/5160 target=_blank>Pannychis</a> is mine. She has already received from me six thousand drachmas and will get more as soon as I sell my cargo. Come along, <a href=/people/5160 target=_blank>Pannychis</a>. Let our valiant chiliarch disport himself with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417265ROdr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41.7>Odrysians</a>. <br />DORCAS: My mistress is free. She will follow whomever she pleases <br />PANNYCHIS: (Low) What shall I do, <a href=/people/3382 target=_blank>Dorcas</a>? <br />DORCAS: It is best to return inside. You can't remain near <a href=/people/322 target=_blank>Polemon</a> while he is in such a dudgeon. He will become even more jealous. <br />PANNYCHIS: All right. Let us go in. <br />POLEMON: I warn you that this is the last time you will drink together. It is not for play alone that I have survived so many a martial slaughter. I shall kill. My <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>, <a href=/people/1247 target=_blank>Parmenon</a>! Let the phalanx cut off this street from the rest of the metropolis! To the front, hoplites! Slingers and bowmen on the flanks! The rest to the rear of the column! <br />PHILOSTRATOS: You think you are talking to children, mercenary. Do you believe you frighten us? Ah, what grand words! Indeed, have you ever killed a rooster? Where did you see war? You may have mounted guard over some safe rampart; possibly not even that. <br />POLEMON: You will learn very soon where I saw war. Wait till you see us in arms! <br />PHILOSTRATOS: Come on then! Bring on your phalanx! I and this faithful Tibios will show you what can be done with stones and oyster shells. We'll make you run so hard that you won't know the why or whither of your hurry. </p>                        </div>

I have her word for it she will be two-and-twenty next Elaphobolion. <br />TRY: Well, which are you going to trust--her word, or your own eyes? Just take a careful look at her temples some day; that is the only place where her own hair shows; all the rest is a thick wig; but at the temples, when the dye fades a little, you can easily detect the grey. But that is nothing; insist on seeing more than her face. <br />CH: Oh, but I am not favoured so far as that. <br />TRY: No, I should think not. She knows what the effect would be; why, she is all over--oh, talk of leopard-skins! And it was she made you cry like that, was it? I dare say, now, she was very cruel and scornful? <br />CH: Yes, she was, dear; and such a lot of money as she has from me! Just now she wants a thousand drachmas; well, I am dependent on my father, and he is very close, and I could not very well get it; so she is at home to <a href=/people/1890 target=_blank>Moschion</a>, and will not see me. That is why you are here; I thought it might vex her. <br />TRY: Well, I'm sure I never never would have come if I had been told what it was for--just to vex somebody else, and that somebody old coffin-ripe Philematium! I shall go away; for that matter the third cock-<a href=/people/10957 target=_blank>crow</a> is past. <br />CH: No, no, not so fast, <a href=/people/4737 target=_blank>Tryphaena</a>. If it is all true--the wig, the dye, and the leopard-skin--I shall hate the sight of her. <br />TRY: If your mother has ever seen her at the bath, ask her. As to the age, you had better ask your grandfather about that, if he is alive. <br />CH: Well, as that is what she is like, come up close to me. Give me your arms--and your lips--and let us be friends. Philematium be hanged!</p>                        </div>

But I deserve it all! I ought to have treated you as any other girl would do,--bothered you for money, and been engaged when you called, and made you cheat your father or rob your mother to get presents for me; instead of which, I have always let you in from the very first time, and it has never cost you a penny, <a href=/people/142 target=_blank>Lysias</a>. Think of all the lovers I have sent away: Ethocles, now a Chairman of Committees, and <a href=/people/765 target=_blank>Pasion</a> the shipowner, and young <a href=/people/1224 target=_blank>Melissus</a>, who had just come into all his father's money. I would not have a word to say to one of them; I kept myself for you, hard-hearted <a href=/people/11023 target=_blank>Phaon</a> that you are! I was fool enough to believe all your vows, and have been living like a <a href=/people/264 target=_blank>Penelope</a> for your sake; mother is furious about it, and is always talking at me to her friends. And now that you feel sure of me, and know how I dote on you, what is the consequence? You flirt with Lycaena under my very eyes, just to vex me; you sit next to me at dinner, and pay compliments to Magidium, a mere music-girl, and hurt my feelings, and make me cry. And that wine-party the other day, with <a href=/people/2550 target=_blank>Thraso</a> and <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a>, when Cymbalium the flute-girl was there, and Pyrallis: you know how I hate that girl: as for Cymbalium, whom you kissed no less than five times, I didn't mind so much about that,--it must have been sufficient punishment in itself:--but the way in which you were always making signs to Pyrallis to notice your cup, and whispering to the boy, when you gave it back to him, that he was not to fill it for any one but Pyrallis! and that piece of apple that you bit off and shot across right into her lap, when you saw that <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> was occupied with <a href=/people/2550 target=_blank>Thraso</a>,--you never even tried to conceal it from me! and she kissed it, and hid it away beneath her girdle.</p>                        </div>

My father had found out about this precious Ioessa, and how long it had been going on, and he locked me in, and gave the porter orders not to open to me.

To make a long story short, I got out, and came here. It was midnight, and I found the door carefully barred. Instead of knocking, I quietly lifted the door off its hinges (it was not the first time I had done so) and passed noiselessly in. Every one was asleep.

Hymnis <br />LEONT: And then that battle with the Galatians; tell her about that, Chenidas — how I rode out in front on the grey, and the Galatians (brave fellows, those Galatians, too) — but they ran away directly they saw me; not a man stood his ground. That time, you know, I used my lance for a javelin, and sent it through their captain and his horse as well; and then, as some of them were left — the phalanx was broken up, you see, but a certain number had rallied— well, I pulled out my trusty blade, rode at them as hard as I could go, knocked over half a dozen of the front rank with the mere rush of my horse, brought down my sword on one of the officers, and clove his head in two halves, helmet and all. The rest of you came up shortly, you remember, when they were already running. <br />CHEN: Oh, but that duel of yours with the satrap in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a>! that was a fine display, too. <br />LEONT: Well remembered; yes, that was not so bad, either. A great big fellow that satrap was, supposed to be a champion fighter too — thought nothing of Greek science. Out he came, and challenged all corners to single combat. There was consternation among our officers, from the lowest to the general himself — though he was a pretty good man. Aristaechmus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=person long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolian</a> he was — very strong on the javelin; I was only a colonel then. However, I was not afraid. I shook off the friends who clung to me— they were anxious about me when they saw the barbarian resplendent in his gilded armour, towering high with his terrible plume and brandishing his lance— <br />CHEN: Yes, I was afraid that time; you remember how I clung to you and besought you not to sacrifice yourself; life would not have been worth living, if you had fallen. <br />LEONT: I ventured it, though. Out I went, as well armed as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=person long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a>, all gold like him. What a shout there was on both sides! the barbarians recognized me too; they knew my buckler and medals and plume. Who was it they all compared me to, Chenidas? <br />CHEN: Why, who should it be? <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, of course; the son of Peleus and Thetis, of course. Your helmet was so magnificent, your purple so rich, your buckler so dazzling. <br />LEONT: We met. The barbarian drew first blood— just a scratch with his lance a little above the knee; but my great spear drove through his shield and right into the breast-bone. Then I ran up, just sliced his head off with my sword, and came back carrying his arms, the head spiked on my spear dripping gore upon me. <br />HYMN: How horrid, Leontichus! what disgusting frightful tales you tell about yourself! What girl would look at a man who likes such nastiness— let alone drink or sleep with him? I am going away. <br />LEONT: Pooh!

I am sure I should die; I never saw a chicken killed, even. <br />LEONT: Such a coward, girl? so poor of heart?

Good-bye, mightiest of colonels, and murderer of however many it is! <br />LEONT: Stay, girl, stay.— Why, she is gone! <br />CHEN: Well, Leontichus, you frightened the simple little thing with your nodding plumes and your incredible exploits. I saw her getting pale as far back as the officer story; her face was all puckered up and quivering when you split his head. <br />LEONT: I thought it would make me more attractive. Well, but it was your fault too; you started the duel. <br />CHEN: Well, I had to chime in when I saw what you were bragging for. But you laid it on so thick. Pass the cutting off the wretched <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=person long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonian</a>'s head, what did you want to spike it on a spear for, and let the blood run down on you? <br />LEONT: That was a bit too strong, I admit; the rest was rather well put together. Well, go and persuade her to come back. <br />CHEN: Shall I tell her you lied to make her think you a fine fellow? <br />LEONT: Oh, plague upon it! <br />CHEN: It's the only way. Choose— a mighty champion, and loathed, or a confessed liar, and— Hymnis? <br />LEONT: Bad is the best; but I say Hymnis.

This is not sandals from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363293UPat class=place long=29.316 lat=36.2618>Patara</a> or cheese from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368226PGyt class=place long=22.5623 lat=36.7637>Gythion</a> and a lot of worthless chatter about love, mournful sailor! <br />DORION: But you don't say how he is himself. You don't describe the man you prefer to me on account of his impossible riches. He is more than fifty years old. He is bald-headed. He is as red as a lobster. And you haven't noticed his teeth, I suppose. Where are his teeth, <a href=/people/1843 target=_blank>Myrtale</a>? I ask you: Where are his teeth? And what grace is his? O <a href=/people/526 target=_blank>Dioscuri</a>, what grace! It is most evident when he tries to sing and play the young fellow. An <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> strumming on a lyre! You can keep your <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>! He is quite worthy of you. May you have a son that looks like the father! As for me, I'll find my <a href=/people/5603 target=_blank>Delphis</a> or Kymbalion. Don't you worry! Your neighbor, the flute player, looks pretty good to me. Carpets, necklaces, gifts of two hundred drachmas aren't bad. You can't have a good-looking young man like me, but you must sleep with a sack of offal, insist on carpets, necklaces and rich gifts. We can't have everything, you know. <br />MYRTALE (Ironically) Oh, happy will be the woman whom you choose as your beloved! For you will bring her <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> onions and cheese upon your return from Gythion. </p>                        </div>

Where do you hail from with your flutes all broken? <br />PARTHENIS: The soldier, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=demonym long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolian</a>, the big fellow, he beat me because he found me playing in the house of that <a href=/people/4947 target=_blank>Crocale</a> woman. I was paid by <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgos</a>. <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgos</a> is his rival. And he broke my flutes and beat me and did all kinds of nasty things. And he turned over the table and threw himself on the krater and emptied it. And then he seized <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgos</a>, the farmer, by his hair and dragged him out of the banquet hall. And the soldier — I think <a href=/people/5601 target=_blank>Deinomachos</a> is his name — and some of his comrades surrounded the farmer and beat him so hard. I don't know, <a href=/people/9166 target=_blank>Cochlis</a>, if he'll ever recover. Blood flowed from his nostrils and his face was swollen and blue. <br />COCHLIS: Was the man insane or drunk? It sounds like the work of a drunkard. <br />PARTHENIS: I think it was jealousy, <a href=/people/9166 target=_blank>Cochlis</a>, jealousy and too much love. <a href=/people/4947 target=_blank>Crocale</a> asked the soldier for twelve hundred drachmas if he wanted to have her exclusively for himself. <a href=/people/5601 target=_blank>Deinomachos</a> refused to give the sum, and she shut the door in his face and received instead <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgos</a> of Oinoe, a rich farmer who had been in love with her for some time. They drank together and I came to play the flute. The banquet was going along fine. I had just finished a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> melody and the farmer had got up and danced, while the <a href=/people/4947 target=_blank>Crocale</a> beat time with her palms, and everything was joyful, when all of a sudden there was a noise and a shout and the front door burst off its hinges and eight young men rushed into the hall, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=demonym long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> among them. Without stopping to explain, they overturned the table; and <a href=/people/1265 target=_blank>Gorgos</a>, as I have said, was knocked down, kicked and beaten on his head. The <a href=/people/4947 target=_blank>Crocale</a> woman succeeded in saving herself by running away to the house of her neighbor, the courtesan Thespias. As for me, <a href=/people/5601 target=_blank>Deinomachos</a> slapped me good and hard and called me Ball of Smut and threw my flutes in my face. Then two of his soldier friends tore my robe and tunic off my body and played with me. They slapped and beat me about my thighs till my nether part was burning red. Then they lifted their own tunics and made me sink down in their laps so that I felt very much ashamed. Then they obliged me to take . . . . . . between my lips, saying: Try a new melody, genial little flute player! Now I am bound for my master's house. I am going to tell him everything that happened. The farmer went to find friends in the city to help him bring the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=demonym long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> to justice. <br />COCHLIS: That is what you get out of those resplendent military love affairs — blows and lawsuits. To hear them talk they are all chiliarchs or hegemons. But when it comes to paying for services rendered — Wait, they say, Wait till I get paid. As soon as I receive my salary, you will surely be made happy. Let those boasters carry themselves off to their wars! May they all be killed off! I believe I do best by not receiving any of that herd. All others are welcome: fishermen, sailors, farmers, they are all welcome. They don't know how to flatter, but they pay. Anyhow, those flaunters of plumes and tellers of martial tales are never serious lovers. What do they know about love! </p>                        </div>
