                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg034:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;SILENUS O <a href=/people/1553 target=_blank>Bromius</a>, unnumbered are the toils I bear because of thee, no less now than when I was young and hale; first, when thou wert driven mad by <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> and didst leave the mountain nymphs, thy nurses; next, when in battle with earth-born spearmen I stood beside thee on the right as squire, and slew <a href=/people/2137 target=_blank>Enceladus</a>, smiting him full in the middle of his targe with my spear. Come, though, let me see; must I confess 'twas all a dream? No, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>! since I really showed his spoils to the Bacchic god. And now am I enduring to the full a toil still worse than those. For when <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> sent forth a race of Tyrrhene <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a> against thee, that thou mightest be smuggled far away, I, as soon as the news reached me, sailed in quest of thee with my children; and, taking the helm myself, I stood on the end of the stern and steered our trim craft; and my sons, sitting at the oars, made the grey billows froth and foam as they sought thee, my liege, But just as we had come nigh <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Malea</a> in our course, an east wind blew upon the ship and drove us hither to the rock of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a>, where in lonely caverns dwell the one-eyed children of ocean's god, the murdering <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a>. Captured by one of them we are slaves in his house; <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a> they call him whom we serve; and instead of Bacchic revelry we are herding a godless <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>'s flocks; and so it is my children, striplings as they are, tend the young thereof on the edge of the downs; while my appointed task is to stay here and fill the troughs and sweep out the cave, or wait upon the ungodly <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> at his impious feasts. His orders now compel obedience; I have to scrape out his house with the rake you see, so as to receive the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, my absent master, and his <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> in clean caverns. But already I see my children driving their browsing flocks towards me. What means this? is the beat of feet in the <a href=/people/5251 target=_blank>Sicinnis</a> dance the same to you now as when ye attended the Bacchic god in his revelries and made your way with dainty steps to the music of lyres to the halls of <a href=/people/1122 target=_blank>Althaea</a>? (The CHORUS OF SATYRS enters, driving a flock of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. Servants follow them.) </p>                        </div>

(To SILENUS) But prithee, why such haste, father? <br />SILENUS: I see the hull of a ship from Hellas at the shore, and men, that wield the oar, on their way to this cave with some chieftain. About their necks they carry empty vessels and pitchers for water; they are in want of food. Luckless strangers! who can they be? They know not what manner of man our master <a href=/people/882 target=_blank>Polyphemus</a> is, to have set foot here in his cheerless abode and come to the jaws of the cannibal <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> in an evil hour.

Why, what is this? We seem to have chanced upon a city of the Bromian god; here by the caves I see a group of <a href=/people/185 target=_blank>Satyrs</a>. To the eldest first I bid All hail! <br />SILENUS: All hail, sir! tell me who thou art, and name thy country. <br />ODYSSEUS <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383204UIth class=person long=20.643 lat=38.453>Ithaca</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382206IKep class=ethnic long=20.59 lat=38.2>Cephallenians</a>' land. <br />SILENUS: I know him for a prating knave, one of <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a>' shrewd offspring. </p>                        </div>

Now when that hell-cook, god-detested, had everything quite ready, he caught up a pair of my companions and proceeded deliberately to cut the throat of one of them over the yawning brazen pot; but the other he clutched by the tendon of his heel, and, striking him against a sharp point of rocky stone, dashed out his brains; then, after hacking the fleshy parts with glutton cleaver, he set to grilling them, but the limbs he threw into his cauldron to seethe. And I, poor wretch, drew near with streaming eyes and waited on the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>; but the others kept cowering like frightened birds in crannies of the rock, and the blood forsook their skin. Anon, when he had gorged himself upon my comrades' flesh and had fallen on his back, breathing heavily, there came a sudden inspiration to me. I filled a cup of Maron's wine and offered him a draught, saying, <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, son of Ocean's god, see here what heavenly drink the grapes of Hellas yield, glad gift of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. He, glutted with his shameless meal, took and drained it at one draught, and, lifting up his hand, he thanked me thus Dearest to me of all my guests! fair the drink thou givest me to crown so fair a feast. Now when I saw his delight, I gave him another cup, knowing the wine would make him rue it, and he would soon be paying the penalty.

So there he is singing discordantly amid the weeping of my fellow-sailors, and the cave re-echoes; but I have made my way out quietly and would fain save thee and myself, if thou wilt. Tell me then, is it your wish, or is it not, to fly from this unsocial wretch and take up your abode with <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiad</a> nymphs in the halls of the Bacchic god? Thy father within approves this scheme; but there! he is powerless, getting all he can out of his liquor; his wings are snared by the cup as if he had flown against bird-lime, and he is fuddled; but thou art young and lusty; so save thyself with my help and regain thy old friend <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, so little like the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>. <br />LEADER: Best of friends, would we might see that day, escaping the godless <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>! </p>                        </div>

Truly we have long heard of thy cleverness. <br />ODYSSEUS: I mean to keep him from this revel, saying he must not give this drink to his brethren but keep it for himself alone and lead a happy life. Then when he falls asleep, o'ermastered by the Bacchic god, I will put a point with this sword of mine to an olive-branch I saw lying in the cave, and will set it on fire; and when I see it well alight, I will lift the heated brand, and, thrusting it full in the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>' eye, melt out his sight with its blaze; and, as when a man in fitting the timbers of a ship makes his auger spin to and fro with a double strap, so will I make the brand revolve in the eye, that gives the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a> light and will scorch up the pupil thereof. <br />LEADER: Ho! ho! how glad I feel! wild with joy at the contrivance! <br />ODYSSEUS: That done, I will embark thee and those thou lovest with old <a href=/people/344 target=_blank>Silenus</a> in the deep hold of my black ship, my ship with double banks of oars, and carry you away from this land. <br />LEADER: Well, can I too lay hold of the blinding brand, as though the god's libation had been poured? for I would fain have a share in this offering of blood. </p>                        </div>

I am being mocked; ye jeer me in my evil plight. <br />LEADER: They are no longer there; but facing thee that stranger stands. <br />CYCLOPS: Master of villainy, where, oh! where art thou? <br />ODYSSEUS: Some way from thee I am keeping careful guard over the person of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>. <br />CYCLOPS: What, a new name! hast changed thine? <br />ODYSSEUS: Yes, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, the name my father gave me. But thou wert doomed to pay for thy unholy feast; for I should have seen <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> burned to but sorry purpose, unless I had avenged on thee the slaughter of my comrades. <br />CYCLOPS: Woe is me!

E'en as I say, so have I done. And now will I get me to the beach and start my hollow ship across the sea of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to the land of my fathers. <br />CYCLOPS: Thou shalt not; I will break a boulder off this rock and crush thee, crew and all, beneath my throw. Blind though I be, I will climb the hill, mounting through yonder tunnel. <br />LEADER: As for us, henceforth will we be the servants of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, sharing the voyage of this hero <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>. </p>                        </div>
