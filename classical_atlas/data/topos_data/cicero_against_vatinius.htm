                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi023:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If, O <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, I had chosen to regard merely what the unworthiness of your character deserved, I should have treated you in a way that would have been very pleasing to these men, and, as your evidence could not, on account of the infamy of your life and the scandal of your private conduct, be possibly considered of the slightest consequence, I should have dismissed you without saying a single word to you. For not one of these men considered it worth my while either to refute you, as if you were an adversary of any importance, or to question you, as if you were a scrupulous witness. But I was, perhaps, a little more intemperate just now than I should have been. For from detestation of you, in which, although, on account of your wicked conduct to me, I ought to go beyond all men, yet I am in fact surpassed by everybody, I was carried away so far, that though I did not despise you at all less than I detest you, still I chose to dismiss you in embarrassment and distress, rather than in contempt. <br /> [2] Wherefore, that you may not wonder at my having paid you this compliment of putting questions to you, whom no one thinks worthy of being spoken to or visited, whom no one thinks deserving of a vote, or of the rights of a citizen, or even of the light of life; know that no motive would have induced me to do so, except that of repressing that ferocity of yours, and crushing your audacity, and checking your loquacity by entangling it in the few questions I should put to you. In truth, you ought, O <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, even if you had become suspected by Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> undeservedly, still to pardon me, if, on the occasion of such great danger to a man who has done me such great services, I had yielded to the consideration of what his necessities required, and what his inclination deserved of me. [3] But you unintentionally showed a few moments ago that you spoke falsely in the evidence which you gave yesterday, when you asserted that you had never had the least conversation with Albinovanus, not only about the prosecution of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, but about anything whatever; and yet you said just now that Titus <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> had been in communication with you, and had asked your advice with respect to the conduct of the prosecution against <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, and that Albinovanus, who you had said before was hardly known to you, had come to your house, and had held a long conversation with you. And lastly, you said that you had given to Albinovanus the written harangues of Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, which he had never had any knowledge of, and did not know where to find, and that they had been read at this trial. And by one of these statements you confessed that the accusers had been instructed and suborned by you; and by the other you confessed your own inconsistency, liable to the double charge of folly and of perjury; when you stated that the man who you had previously said was an entire stranger to you, had come to your house, and that you had given the documents which he asked for to aid him in his accusation to a man whom you had from the beginning considered a trickster and a prevaricator. </p>                        </div>

I ask whether <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> has ever passed any law in defiance of the auspices? whether he has despised the <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> or the Fufian law? when he has offered violence to the consul? whether he has occupied any temple with armed men? whether he has driven away by violence any magistrate who was exercising his veto? whether he has profaned any religious ceremonies? whether he has drained the treasury? whether he has pillaged the republic? These, all these, are actions of yours. No imputation of this sort is cast upon <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>. He was said to have read a document. It was urged in his defence, his colleagues giving evidence in support of his cause, that he read it not for the sake of reading it but for the sake of examining it more particularly. However, it was quite certain that <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> dismissed the council that day, and submitted to the interposition of the veto. But you who are offended at my defending <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, what cause do you bring to your advocates to uphold, or what countenance have you to show? when you already point out to them in an imperious manner, what a disgrace it will be to them if they defend you by thinking the defence of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> a matter for accusation and abuse of me. <br /> [6] However, <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, remember this — that a little after the time when I defended him in a way which you say gave great offence to all good men, I was appointed consul in the most honourable manner in which any one has been elected since the memory of man, not only by the exceeding zeal in my behalf of the entire Roman people, but also by the special and extraordinary exertions in my cause of every virtuous man; and that I gained all these honours by living in a modest manner, which you have over and over again said that you hoped to obtain by dealing in the most impudent prophecies. </p>                        </div>

[7] Wherefore, I entreat you, O <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, to pardon me for sparing the country which I had saved; and I beg you, if I bear with you who would willingly be a harasser and destroyer of the republic, to bear also with me who have been its preserver and its guardian. Do you find fault with that man for having departed from the city, who, as you see, was recalled by the regret of all the citizens, and by the grief of the republic herself? <br />Oh, but you say that men were anxious for my return, not for my sake, but for the sake of the republic. As if any man who had mixed himself up in the affairs of the state in a proper spirit could think anything more desirable for him than to be beloved by his fellow-citizens for the sake of the republic. [8] Forsooth, my nature, I suppose, is a harsh one, I am difficult of access, my countenance is forbidding, my answers to men are arrogant, my way of life insolent. No one ever sought the aid of my humanity, — no one was ever anxious for my intimacy, for my advice, or my aid; for mine, out of regret for whom (to say the least of it) the forum was sad, the senate-house silent, and all studies of virtuous and liberal sciences voiceless and lifeless. <br />However, I will allow that nothing was done for my sake. Let us admit that all those resolutions of the senate and commands of the people, and decrees of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and of all companies, and of all colleges and guilds concerning me were passed for the sake of the republic. What then, O man most ignorant of the character of solid glory and real dignity, could possibly happen better for me? What could be more desirable as regards the immortality of my glory and the everlasting recollection of my name, than for all my fellow citizens to be of this opinion, — that the safety of the state was indissolubly bound up with my individual safety? [9] But I will send you back the arrow which you aimed at me. For as you said that I was dear to the senate and people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> not so much for my own sake as for that of the republic, so I say that you, although you are a man of scandalous character, disgraced by every sort of foulness and infamy, still are detested by the city, not so much on your own account as for the sake of the republic. </p>                        </div>

What any one of us may say of himself, that is not the question. Let good men judge; that is the consideration of the greatest importance and weight. [10] There are two times at which the decisions of our fellow-citizens about us are looked for with anxiety, — one when our honours, and the other when our safety is at stake. Honours have been given to few men with such good-will on the part of the Roman people as I have experienced. No one has ever been restored to safety with such extraordinary zeal on the part of all the citizens as I have. But what men think of you we have already had experience when you were a candidate for honour; and now that your safety is at stake, we are in expectation of what we shall see. <br />However, not to compare myself with these the leading men of the state, who are here to give their countenance to Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> by their presence, but merely to compare myself to one, the most impudent and vilest of men, I will just ask you, O <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, — you the most arrogant of all men, and also the most hostile to me, — whether you think it was better and more desirable for this state, for this republic, for this city, for these temples, and for the treasury, and for the senate-house, and for these men whom you see around us, and their property, fortunes, and children, — whether you think it was better and more desirable for all the rest of the citizens, and for the temples of the gods, and for the auspices, and for the religious rites and observances of the city, that I should have been born as a citizen in this city, or that you should? When you have answered me this question, either so impudently that men will hardly he able to keep their hands off you, or in so melancholy a manner as to burst that inflated neck and throat of yours; after that, reply to me from memory to these questions which I am going to put to you. </p>                        </div>

Do you recollect when Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> was unanimously elected quaestor, that you then were named as the last quaestor, against the will of every one; not owing to the kindness which the people felt for you, but only to that of the consul? [12] In that magistracy, when the province of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a>, down by the water's edge, had fallen to your lot, raising a great outcry at the time, were you not sent by me, as I was consul, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>, to prevent gold and silver being exported from thence? While occupied in the discharge of that duty, do you remember that, as you acted as if you supposed that you had been sent, not as a guardian to take care and keep the wealth at home, but as a carrier to distribute it, and as you in a most robber-like manner were examining into every one's house, and store, and ship, and harassing men occupied in business and in trade with most iniquitous law proceedings, frightening merchants as they disembarked from their ships, and delaying them as they were embarking, — do you recollect, I say, that violent hands were laid on you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> while you were present among the body of the Roman settlers? and that the complaints of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> were brought before me as consul? Do you recollect that after your quaestorship you went as lieutenant into the further Spain, Caius <a href=/people/3566 target=_blank>Cosconius</a> being the proconsul? Do you recollect too, that though that journey into Spain is usually made by land, or if any one chooses to go by sea, there is a regular route by which they sail, you came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>, and from thence into Africa? Were you not in the kingdom of <a href=/people/3187 target=_blank>Hiempsal</a>, — a proceeding on your part which was perfectly illegal without a decree of the senate to authorize it? Were you not in the kingdom of Mastanesosus?3 Did you not come to the strait by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350000RMau class=place long=-5 lat=35>Mauritania</a>? and did you ever hear of any lieutenant of any part of Spain before you who went to that province by that route? <br /> [13] You were made tribune of the people, (for why need I put questions to you about the iniquities and most sordid robberies which you committed in Spain?) I ask of you first in a general manner what description of dishonesty and wickedness did you omit to practise in your discharge of that office? And I now give you this warning, — not to mix up your own infamy with the high character of most eminent men. I, in whatever questions I put to you, will question you yourself only, and I will drag you forth not from the dignity of a great man, which you affect, but from your own obscurity and darkness. And all my weapons shall be directed at you in such a manner, that no one else shall be wounded (to use an expression of your own) through your side; my arrows shall stick in your lungs and in your entrails. </p>                        </div>

[22] I ask whether there was ever any one before your time so wicked as to do such a thing as that? So that we may know whether you are an imitator of old crimes or an inventor of new ones.

So that all men may see that you trampled not only on the acts of us whom you call tyrants, but even on the laws of your own most intimate friend; before whom you are in the habit of employing hard words against us, who are very friendly to him, while you abuse him in the most insulting manner every time that you say that he is in the least degree connected with you. <br /> [30] And I wish also to know this from you, with what design or with what intention you attended at the banquet given by Quintus <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a>, an intimate friend of mine, in a black robe? who you ever saw do such a thing before? who you ever heard of having done such a thing? What precedent had you for such conduct, or what custom can you plead for it? You will say that you did not approve of those supplications. Very well. Suppose that those supplications were inexcusable. Do you not see that I am not questioning you at all with respect to the occurrence of that year, nor of those circumstances in which you may appear to be concerned in common with any eminent men; but only about your own peculiar acts of wickedness? Grant that the supplication was informal. Still, tell me, who ever went to a banquet in a mourning garment? For by such conduct the banquet itself is turned into a funeral feast; though the proper intention of a banquet is to be a scene of enjoyment and compliment. </p>                        </div>

When so many thousand men were sitting at the feast, when the master of the feast himself, Quintus <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a>, was in a white robe, you introduced yourself into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCas class=place long=12.48563 lat=41.89172>temple of Castor</a>, with Caius Fidulus and the rest of your Furies, in black garments, like the assistants at a funeral. Who was there who did not then receive you with groans? who was there who did not lament over the fate of the republic? what other topic of conversation was there at that banquet except this, that this city, so great and so wise, was now exposed not only to your frenzy, but also to your derision? [32] Were you ignorant of the usual practice on such occasions? had you never seen a feast of the sort? had you never, when a boy or young man, been among the cooks? had you not a short time before satisfied your ancient voracity at that most magnificent banquet of <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a>, a noble young man? And when did you ever see the master of a feast and his friends in mourning, and in black robes, while sitting at a feast? What insanity took possession of you, that you should think, that, unless you did what it was impious to do, unless you insulted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCas class=place long=12.48563 lat=41.89172>temple of Castor</a>, and the name of a feast, and the eyes of a citizen, and ancient custom, and the authority of the man who had invited you, you had not given sufficient proof that you did not think that a properly decreed and formal supplication? </p>                        </div>

I ask you, whether you were not prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of the Licinian and Junian laws? whether Caius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, the praetor, did not in accordance with that law, order you by his edict to appear on the thirtieth day? When that day arrived, did you not do what was not only never done before in this republic, but what was never even heard of, at any time since the beginning of the world? Did you not appeal to the tribunes of the people to save you from the necessity of pleading your cause? I have put the case too lightly; although that of itself would be an unprecedented and an intolerable thing to have done; but did you not appeal by name to that pest of the year, to that Fury of his country, to that storm which was desolating the republic, to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>? and when he could not by any right which he possessed, or by virtue of any precedent or by any power given him by his office, offer any obstacle to proceedings in a court of justice, he had recourse to his usual violence and frenzy, and put himself at the head of your soldiers as their leader. And, in respect to this transaction, that you may not consider anything as a direct statement of mine, rather than as elicited by questions put to you, I will not impose on myself the burden of producing any evidence in support of what I say; and what I see that I shall have to state in the same place in a short time, I will reserve at present and I will not accuse you; but as I have done with respect to other matters, I will only put questions to you. <br /> [34] I ask you then, O <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, whether any one in the state since the first foundation of the city, has ever appealed to the tribunes of the people to interpose and save him from having to plead his case? Has any criminal ever mounted up to the tribunal of the president of the court which tried him and driven him down from thence by violence? and upset all the benches? and overturned all the balloting urns? and in short, in disturbing the court of justice committed all those crimes on account of which courts of justice were instituted? Are you aware that <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> fled at that time? that your accusers were with difficulty saved from your hands and those of your friends? that the judges were even driven away out of the tribunals which were near? that in the forum, in broad daylight in the sight of the Roman people, the investigation was put an end to, and the magistrates, and the usages of our ancestors, and the laws, and the judges, and the defendant and the penalty, were all alike disregarded and trampled on? Do you know that all these circumstances were, by the diligence of Caius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, entered and proved in the public records? And moreover, I ask you this, when, after you had had an accusation preferred against you, you returned from your lieutenancy, in order that no one might think that you wished to avoid a trial; and when you used to say that, though you might have done whichever you pleased, still you preferred pleading your cause, as you had been accused; I ask, I say, how it was consistent with that conduct of yours, in being unwilling to avail yourself of the door of escape which your lieutenancy opened to you, for you to have recourse to an impious source of assistance by means of a most dishonest appeal? </p>                        </div>

I understand, from your gestures, what answer you are going to give. By your own law, you say. Are not you, then, a most manifest parricide of your country? Had not you had regard to the idea that the conscript fathers might be wholly destroyed from out of the republic? — did you not even leave this to the senate, which no one ever took from it — the privilege, namely, of having all lieutenants appointed by authority of that order? Did the great public council appear to you so contemptible? did the senate appear so depressed? did the republic appear so miserable and prostrate, that the senate was no longer able to appoint, in conformity with the uniform precedent of our ancestors, the messengers of peace and war, and managers, and interpreters, and authors of warlike determinations, and ministers of the different sorts of provincial duty? <br /> [36] You had taken from the senate the power of decreeing provinces to the different magistrates, and the decision as to what general was to be appointed to a command, and the management of the treasury; things which the Roman people never coveted for itself, as it never endeavoured to deprive the republic of the direction of the supreme council. Come, some of these things have been also done by others; it has seldom happened, but still it has happened, that the people has selected a general. Who ever heard that lieutenants have been appointed without a resolution of the senate to authorize it? No one before you. Immediately after you, <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> did the same thing, in the case of those two pestilences of the republic; and, on this account, you deserve to be punished with still greater misfortunes; because you have injured the republic, not only by your deed, but also by your example; and because you are not only infamous yourself, but you have also wished to teach others to be so too. Do you not know that, on all these accounts, you have been branded with the unfavourable judgment of those most strict men, the <a href=/people/11083 target=_blank>Sabines</a>, of those brave tribes, the <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsi</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421139RPae class=ethnic long=13.9 lat=42.1>Peligni</a>, people of the same tribe as yourself, and that there is no other instance, since the foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, of any man of the Sergian tribe having lost the votes of that tribe? <br /> [37] And I wish to hear this also from you, why it is, since I carried the law with respect to bribery and corruption in accordance with the terms of a resolution of the senate and carried it without violence, and with every proper regard to the auspices and to the <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> and Fufian laws that you do not consider that a law? especially as I obey your laws whatever the means are by which they were carried; while my law expressly forbids any one to exhibit shows of gladiators within two years of his standing, or being about to stand for an office, unless he does so in compliance with a will on a day appointed in the will. How can you be so insane as to dare to exhibit shows of gladiators actually at the very time when you are a candidate? Do you think that any tribune of the people can be found like that undeniable gladiator of yours, who will interpose to save you from being prosecuted according to the provisions of my law? </p>                        </div>

That, on that, some one asked him how he liked <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> being repulsed? and that he replied, that <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> had done nothing in his tribuneship without a sufficient recompense; and that, as he cared about nothing but money, he could afford to fail in attaining honour with great equanimity.

Is this to be a matter left to your option and in your power, so that when you see <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s band of artisans, and that troop of furious and abandoned men, you then say, as you said in the assembly, that <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> has besieged the republic with gladiators and men who combat with beasts; but when you come before such men as these, then you do not venture to say anything against a citizen of extraordinary virtue, and integrity, and wisdom, and firmness? [41] But as you praise Titus <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> so excessively, and by your encomium cast some sort of slight stain on that most illustrious man, (for Titus <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> would prefer being one of those men who are loaded with reproaches by you,) still I ask, since in the administration of the affairs of the republic there has been an entire community of and agreement in every counsel between Titus <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> and Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, (a fact which has been proved not only by the decision of the good, but also by that of the wicked; for each of them is now on his trial on the same account and for the same accusation, — the one having had a prosecution instituted against him by that man whom you are sometimes accustomed to confess is the only man who is more worthless than yourself, and the other being reduced to the same condition by your design indeed, not with his assistance,) — I ask, I say, how you can separate those men in your evidence, whom you connect together by your accusation? <br />The last thing which I wish you to answer me is this: — As you said a great deal against Albinovanus with respect to his prevarication, I wish to know whether you said or did not say that you were not pleased at <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> being prosecuted for violence, and that he ought not to have been so prosecuted; and that there was no law and no charge on which he was not more liable to impeachment? Did you also say that the cause of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, a most admirable man, was generally considered as closely connected with his cause? and that the things which were done by <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> in my behalf were agreeable to good men? I am not now arguing against the inconsistency of your language and of your evidence; for you have given evidence at great length against those identical actions of this man which you say have been approved of by good men; and as for the man with whom you connect the cause and danger of my client, <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, you have extolled him with the highest praises. But I ask this; — whether you think that Publius <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> ought to be condemned according to the provisions of a law under which you say that he never ought to have been accused at all? or, if you think that your opinion ought not be asked while you are giving your evidence, lest I should appear to be attributing to you any authority by so doing, I ask whether you gave evidence against a man on his trial for violence, who you say never ought to have been prosecuted for violence at all? </p>                        </div>
