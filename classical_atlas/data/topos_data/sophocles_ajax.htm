It is dawn. ODYSSEUS is discovered examining the ground before the tent. ATHENA appears from above.) <br />ATHENA: Son of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>, ever do I behold thee <br />Scheming to snatch some vantage o'er thy foes. <br />And now among the tents that guard the ships <br />Of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, camped at the army's outmost verge, <br />Long have I watched thee hunting in his trail, <br />And scanning his fresh prints, to learn if now <br />He be within or forth. Skilled in the chase <br />Thou seemest, as a keen-nosed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hound</a>. <br />For the man but now has passed within, his face <br />And slaughterous hands streaming with sweat and blood. <br />No further need for thee to peer about <br />Inside these doors. But say what eager quest <br />Is thine, that I who know may give thee light. <br />ODYSSEUS: Voice of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, dearest of Gods to me, <br />How clearly, though thou be invisible, <br />Do I hear thy call, and seize it with my soul, <br />As when a bronze-mouthed Tyrrhene trumpet sounds! <br />Rightly thou judgest that on a foe's trail, <br />Broad-shielded <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, I range to and fro. <br />Him, and no other, I have long been tracking. <br />This very night against us he has wrought <br />A deed incredible, if in truth 'tis he. <br />For we know nothing sure, but drift in doubt. <br />Gladly I assumed the burden of this task. <br />For not long since we found that our whole spoil <br />Had been destroyed, both herds and flocks, slaughtered <br />By some man's hand, their guardians dead beside them. <br />Now 'tis on him that all men lay this guilt: <br />And a scout who had seen him swiftly bounding <br />Across the plain alone with reeking sword, <br />Informed me and bore witness. I forthwith, <br />Darting in hot chase, now pick out his tracks, <br />But now, bewildered, know not whose they are. <br />Timely thou comest. As in past days, so <br />In days to come I am guided by thy hand. <br />ATHENA: I know it, <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>: so on the path betimes <br />A sentinel friendly to thy chase I came. <br />ODYSSEUS: Dear mistress, do I labour to good purpose? <br />ATHENA: Know 'twas by yonder man these deeds were wrought. <br />ODYSSEUS: And why did he so brandish a frenzied hand? <br />ATHENA: In grievous wrath for <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>' panoply. <br />ODYSSEUS: Why then upon the flocks did he make this onslaught? <br />ATHENA: Your blood he deemed it was that stained his hand. </p>                        </div>

Did he reach his goal? <br />ATHENA: He stood already at the two chiefs' doors. <br />ODYSSEUS: What then withheld his eager hand from bloodshed? <br />ATHENA: 'Twas I restrained him, casting on his eyes overmastering notions of that baneful ecstasy, <br />That turned his rage on flocks and mingled droves <br />Of booty yet unshared, guarded by herdsmen. <br />Then plunging amid the thronging horns he slew, <br />Smiting on all sides; and one while he fancied <br />The <a href=/people/1152 target=_blank>Atreidae</a> were the captives he was slaughtering, <br />Now 'twas some other chief on whom he fell. <br />And I, while thus he raved in maniac throes, <br />Urged him on, drove him into the baleful toils. <br />Thereafter, when he had wearied of such labours, <br />He bound with thongs such <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> as yet lived, <br />With all the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and drove them to his tents, <br />As though his spoil were men, not horned <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. <br />Now lashed together in the hut he tortures them. <br />But to thee too will I expose this madness, <br />That seeing thou mayst proclaim it to all the Greeks. <br />Boldly await him here, nor apprehend <br />Mischance; for I will turn aside his eyes, <br />Foiling his vision lest he see thy face. <br />(She calls to AJAX within the tent.)
