But as time went on, each chafed at the other's rule, and the armies of Gaul and <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> demanded an emperor of their own naming, and so all parts of the empire were thrown into an uproar. <br />3 Now <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> came of a noble family, but he was a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358106UHad class=place long=10.6387 lat=35.8258>Hadrumetum</a> in Africa. 4 Because of this, he applied to himself the oracle in praise of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, which we quoted in the Life of <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a>, for he did not wish it to be interpreted as the worst is the White One, which is contained in the same line in which <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> is praised and <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> commended. 5 But before I discourse on his life and his death I should relate the manner in which he became ennobled.  <a href=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Clodius_Albinus*.html#1 target=_blank>SOL</a></p>                        </div>

I wrote you once officially about the succession to the throne and your own elevation to honour, but I am now sending you this private and confidential message, all written with my own hand, as you will see, in which I empower you, should emergency arise, to present yourself to the soldiers and assume the name of Caesar. 3 For I hear that both <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Septimius Severus</a> and <a href=/people/2174 target=_blank>Nonius</a> <a href=/people/1451 target=_blank>Murcus</a> are speaking ill of me to their troops, hoping thereby to get the appointment to the post of Augustus. 4 You shall have full power besides, when you thus present yourself, to give the soldiers a largess of three aurei apiece. You will get a letter which I am sending to my procurators to this effect, sealed with my signet of an <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazon</a>, which you will deliver to my stewards when the need arises, that they may not refuse your demands on the treasury. 5 And that you may received some definite symbol of an emperor's majesty, I authorize you to wear both at the present time and at my court the scarlet cloak. Later, when you are with me, you shall have the imperial purple, though without the embroidery in gold.

For he saw that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was hated because of his evil ways, which were bringing destruction upon the state and dishonour upon himself, and that he would sometime or other be slain, and he feared that he might perish with him. <br />2 There is still in existence the speech he made when he accepted the imperial power — some say, indeed, by <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>' wish and authorization — in which he makes allusion to this refusal. 3 Of this speech I append a copy: It is against my will, my comrades, that I am exalted to empire, and a proof of it is this, that when <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> once gave me the name of Caesar, I scorned it. Now, however, I must yield to your desire and to that of <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> Augustus, for I believe that under an upright man and a brave one the state can be well ruled. <br />4 It is an undeniable fact, moreover, and <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> also relates it, that <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> at first intended to name <a href=/people/11051 target=_blank>Pescennius</a> <a href=/people/12194 target=_blank>Niger</a> and <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> as his successors, in case aught befell him. 5 Later, as it happened, in the interest of his growing sons, and through envy of the affection in which <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> was held, and most of all because of his wife's entreaties, he changed his purpose and crushed both of them in war. 6 But he did name <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> consul, and this he never would have done had not <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> been a worthy man, since he was ever most careful in his choice of magistrates. </p>                        </div>

And even at that time he showed signs of a haughty and warlike spirit, 2 for at school, it is said, he used often to recite to the children: <br />Madly I seized my arms, though in arms there lay little reason. <br />3 And he repeated again and again the words, Madly I seized my arms. <br />4 It is said that his rule was predicted by a number of omens that occurred at the time of his birth. For instance, a snow-white <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> was born, whose horns were of a deep purple hue. And he is said to have placed these, when tribune of the soldiers, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WAve class=place long=14.0822 lat=40.8393>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, and when he made inquiry of the oracle there concerning his fate, he received a response, it is said, in the following lines: <br />He shall establish the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> though tumult beset her, <br />Riding his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> he shall smite both Poeni and Galli rebellious. <br />5 And, indeed, it is well known that he conquered many tribes in Gaul. He himself always believed, moreover, that the prediction he shall smite the Poeni referred to him and <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, because <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> was a native of Africa. 6 There was another indication of his future rule besides these. A peculiar custom was observed in the family of the Caesars, namely, that the infants of this house should be bathed in tubs of tortoise-shell. Now when <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> was a newly born infant, a fisherman brought as a gift to his father a tortoise of enormous size, 7 and he, being well versed in letters, regarded the gift as an omen and accepted the tortoise gladly. He then gave an order that they should prepare the shell and set it apart for the child for use in the hot baths that are given to infants, hoping that this gift portended noble rank for his son. 8 And again, although <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> appear but rarely in the region in which <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> was born, on the seventh day after his birth, at the very hour of a banquet in honour of the bestowal of his name, seven young <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> were brought in from a nest and placed as though in jest about the cradle of the child. Nor did his father scorn this omen either, but commanded that the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> be fed and guarded with care. 9 Still another omen occurred. It was customary in his family that the bandages in which the children are wrapped should be of a reddish colour. In his case, however, it chanced that the bandages which had been prepared by his mother during her pregnancy had been washed and were not yet dry, and he was therefore wrapped in a bandage of his mother's, and this, as it happened, was of a purple hue. For this reason his nurse, jestingly, gave him the name Porphyrius. 10 These were the omens that betokened his future rule. There were others besides these, but he who desires to learn what they are may read them in <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a>, for he relates all trivial details concerning omens of this sort. </p>                        </div>

His skin was wonderfully white; many indeed think it was from this that he got his name. He had a womanish voice, almost as shrill as a eunuch's. He was easily roused, his anger was terrible, his rage relentless. In his pleasures he was changeable, for he sometimes craved wine and sometimes abstained. 2 He had a thorough knowledge of arms and was not ineptly called the <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> of his age. <br />3 We do not believe it wholly irrelevant to recount the causes which won <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> the love of the senate. 4 After <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had bestowed upon him the name of Caesar, and while by the Emperor's orders he was in command of the troops in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, false tidings were brought that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had been slain. Then he came forth before the soldiers and delivered the following speech: 5 If the senate of the Roman people but had its ancient power, and if this vast empire were not under the sway of a single man, it would never have come to pass that the destiny of the state should fall into the hands of a <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, a <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, or a <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>. Under the rule of consuls there were those mighty families of ours, the Ceionii, the Albini, and the Postumii, of whom your fathers heard from their grandsires and from whom they learned many things. 6 It was surely the senate, moreover, that added Africa to the dominions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the senate that conquered Gaul and the Spains, the senate that gave laws to the tribes of the East, and the senate that dared to attack the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> — and would have conquered them, too, had not the fortune of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> just then assigned our army so covetous a leader. 7 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>, to be sure, was conquered by Caesar, but he was still a senator and not yet dictator. Now as for <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> himself, how much better an emperor would he had been had he stood in awe of the senate! 8 Even as late as the time of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, the power of the senate prevailed, and the senators did not fear to deliver speeches against a base and filthy prince and condemn him, even though he still retained both power of life and death and the empire too. 9 Wherefore, my comrades, the name of Caesar, which <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> now confers on me, I do not wish to accept. May the gods grant that no one else may wish it! 10 Let the senate have rule, let the senate distribute the provinces and appoint us consuls. But why do I say the senate? It is you, I mean, and your fathers; you yourselves shall be the senators. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi2331.phi012:14'><b>&sect; 14</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This harangue was reported at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> while <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> was still alive and roused him greatly against <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>. He forthwith despatched one of his aides, <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, to replace him. 2 The senate, however, was so much pleased that it honoured <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, though absent, with marvellous acclamations, both while <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> still lived and, later, after his murder. Some even counselled <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> to ally himself with <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>, and as for <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a>, <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>' influence had the greatest weight in his plan for murdering <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>. 3 In proof, moreover, that my statements are true, I will quote a letter written by <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> to the prefects of the guard, in which he makes clear his intention of killing <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>; 4 <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> to his prefects, greeting. You have heard, I believe, in the first place, the false statement that I had been slain by a conspiracy of my household; in the second, that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> has delivered an harangue to the senate at great length — and not for nothing, it seems to me. 5 For whoever asserts that the state ought not to be under the sway of one man, and that the senate should rule the empire, he is merely seeking to get the empire himself through the senate. Keep a diligent watch then; for now you know the man whom you and the troops and the people must avoid. <br />6 When <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a> found this letter he desired to make it public in order to stir up hatred against <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a>; and for this reason <a href=/people/818 target=_blank>Albinus</a> advised <a href=/people/732 target=_blank>Julianus</a> to bring about <a href=/people/11046 target=_blank>Pertinax</a>'s death. </p>                        </div>
