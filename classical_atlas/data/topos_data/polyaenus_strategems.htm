From that lowly position he set out to establish himself as tyrant of the city, by the following devices. The citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395223UKra class=place long=22.3057 lat=39.4996>Crannon</a> used to pay by agreement a certain stipend every year for the watch and guard of the city. <a href=/people/1777 target=_blank>Deinias</a> took on this duty; and for three years he performed his office so diligently, that the citizens could walk out more securely in the night, than by day. His conduct in this office gained him a great reputation; and to ingratiate himself further with the people, he hired more watchmen, in order to keep everything in greater security. When the task of collecting the tithe of corn was put out for contract, he persuaded his younger brother, who had never before held any public office, to take it on, by emphasising the profits which could be made from it. His brother, thus appointed collector, associated with him a number of young men, to survey the various tracts of land, and collect the corn. On the occasion of a festival, called Itonia, when the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395223UKra class=place long=22.3057 lat=39.4996>Crannon</a> give themselves up to banqueting and merriment, <a href=/people/1777 target=_blank>Deinias</a> gathered together his own dependants, the watchmen, and the gatherers of corn, who were connected with his brother. With this band of sober men he attacked and easily defeated the drunken citizens; he slew more than a thousand of them, and made himself tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395223UKra class=place long=22.3057 lat=39.4996>Crannon</a>. </p>                        </div>

Himself with his guards, one phalanx of hoplites, and all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> archers, marched eighty stades along the secret road; and halted in the middle of a thick wood.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, thus attacked both above and below, were part of them cut to pieces, some thrown from the precipices, and others taken prisoner. </p>                        </div>

The soil of the plain, on which they fought, was light and sandy: and the two great armies fighting on it, raised such clouds of dust, that both armies were prevented from observing each other's movements. They fought hand to hand; but <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> discovered that the baggage of the enemy was left at a little distance behind, with which were their wives, and children, mistresses, slaves, gold, and silver, and whatever else of value the soldiers, who followed the fortunes of <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, had brought from the army of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> detached some picked horsemen to seize the baggage, and bring it back to his own camp. They accordingly, while the armies were closely engaged, wheeled round, and, with their movement being concealed by a cloud of dust, brought back the baggage, as instructed. After the battle was over, it appeared that <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> had lost five thousand men, and <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> only three hundred. <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>' army therefore returned to their camp in high spirits on the decided success of the day. But as soon as they discovered that their baggage had been carried off, and everything lost, that was precious to them, the victory celebrations were replaced with mourning, and every expression of grief. They were so distressed, the more they reflected on their loss, that many of them sent a deputation to <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, with an offer of their service. When he perceived the effect that the loss of their baggage had on <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>' army, <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> followed it up with a proclamation, that he would let every soldier recover his property without a ransom. After this proclamation, many of them immediately revolted to him — not only <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, but also ten thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> under the command of <a href=/people/1483 target=_blank>Peucestes</a>.

And eventually, there was such a change of sentiment and fortune as a result of this circumstance, that the <a href=/people/12213 target=_blank>Silver Shields</a> delivered up <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> as a prisoner to <a href=/people/12218 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>; who thereby became king of all Asia. </p>                        </div>

They therefore contracted the work out to him, and put into his hands the necessary money. With this money he hired a number of strangers, bought many slaves, and gathered a quantity of stones, timber and iron. As soon as he had laid the foundations, he pretended that his materials had been stolen; and he ordered a proclamation to be made, that if anyone disclosed, who had stolen the stones and iron from the citadel, they would receive a sum of money in reward. The people expressed great indignation at the theft; and gave him permission as he requested, to do what was necessary to prevent such thefts in future; in other words, to strengthen the fortress, and dig a trench around it.

When the company had accordingly left them, he said; Only claim, as I have done, that you possess the secret which I am pretending to reveal; and no-one will venture into any conspiracy against you. <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> was pleased with this advice, and rewarded the man liberally. He told his guards, that the man had revealed to him the most astonishing means of detecting conspirators; which intimidated them so much, that they never ventured in future to form any plots against him. </p>                        </div>

The first use he made of his authority was to stir up the camp servants and the infantry against the merchants and the cavalry, because the latter had every advantage in war, while they themselves struggled under every hardship that attended it. He then ordered them all to disarm themselves, and to pile up their weapons at the gate of the camp, so that an account could be made of them, and their condition could be examined. He ordered the servants to take the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and feed them. He had six hundred peltasts, who were ready to fight and devoted to his interests; and he ordered their commanding officer to make an account of the weapons. Then he withdrew to the trees, where the servants and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were stationed, as if to enjoy the shade a little; and there he persuaded the servants to attack their masters. The servants accordingly mounted the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and seized the weapons, taking them from the peltasts, who were aware of his intentions. Then they fell upon their masters, while they were defenceless and unarmed, and cut them to pieces. The peltasts, who had joined in the slaughter, immediately marched to the city and took possession of it; and in this way, <a href=/people/959 target=_blank>Panaetius</a> became tyrant of the city. </p>                        </div>

For that purpose, some of the citizens joined in a pretended conspiracy, and proposed to betray <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385150PLip class=place long=14.957 lat=38.467>Lipara</a>, an island next to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, to the Roman general Cn.<a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>. <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> accepted their proposal, and ordered half of his fleet to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385150PLip class=place long=14.957 lat=38.467>Lipara</a>, with a military force on board. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> then put to sea; they advanced slowly toward the Roman fleet, and dispatched an embassy to the Roman general, imploring him to grant them a peace. When the ambassadors were admitted to see <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, they asked him to go on board the ship of the Carthaginian admiral, who was at that time exceedingly ill; in order to conclude the treaty in person with them in the clearest and most unequivocal terms. The Roman agreed, and the Africans no sooner saw the enemy's general in their power, than they attacked the Romans in full force, and obtained an easy victory. </p>                        </div>

They had made some progress before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390209UAmb class=ethnic long=20.9538 lat=39.0419>Ambraciots</a> discovered their operations. But when the quantity of earth which was thrown up made their intentions obvious, the defenders made an equal effort to stop them by countermining. They dug a deep ditch at the end of the enemy's works; and placed thin plates of brass in it, in such a way that, whenever the Romans fell into the ditch, the noise was heard by the sentinel. The defenders then entered the ditch, armed with a long spear, which they call sarissa, and engaged with the enemy. However, these subterranean conflicts, in a narrow dark passage, gave no great advantage to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390209UAmb class=ethnic long=20.9538 lat=39.0419>Ambraciots</a>; and they had recourse to another stratagem. They constructed a pot with a mouth as wide as the entrance to the ditch; and perforated the bottom, introducing into it an iron pipe, which they filled with small feathers. They set the feathers on fire, and stopped up the mouth of the pipe with sawdust; the fire was supplied from a brass container, which was fitted to it for that purpose. The enemy's mine works were thus filled with a constant succession of smoke and unbearable stench, which forced them to abandon their excavations. </p>                        </div>

In this book you will observe that even the minds of barbarians are capable of military stratagems, deceptions, and tricks. And therefore you will see that you yourselves should not hold them in too great contempt, and your generals must be similarly cautious. For there is nothing against which they should guard more carefully than tricks, cunning and deception; the barbarians excel much more in these devices, than in military prowess. And nothing will protect them more effectively from the tricks of the barbarians, than a constant distrust of their promises and claims. By uniting this distrust with typical Roman valour, we can be still more superior to them, if we also add a knowledge of the stratagems which they have sometimes employed. </p>                        </div>

Neither beast, nor bird inhabits it; nor do we know whither to proceed, or how to return. <a href=/people/3252 target=_blank>Siraces</a> clapped his hands, and answered him with a laugh, I have gained a noble victory. I have saved my country from impending danger, and I have consigned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army to destruction by famine and thirst.

The king was at the time engaged in a banquet, where <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=person long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Tralles</a> was performing the Bacchae of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>. The actor had just uttered this verse: <br />A new-skinned calf we from the mountains bring, <br />Blest spoil — when they arrived with the head of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, and brought it in to the king. While everyone immediately clapped and cheered, <a href=/people/7689 target=_blank>Exathres</a> jumped up and observed, that the verse was most appropriate for the occasion. This incident gave a new zest to the royal banquet; the king rewarded the bearer with a handsome present, and gave the actor a talent. </p>                        </div>

Her father was dead, and she afterwards married his successor in the kingdom.

She granted them peace, on stipulated terms, which they bound themselves by oath to observe.

On their revolt, <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> wrote a letter, to ask for them to be handed over; which she answered, by alleging that the law of nations justified her in protecting those, who had placed themselves under her protection. The two men, who had revolted, one day requested an audience of her. While one distracted her with a pretended matter of importance, the other levelled a blow at her with a drawn sword, which fell upon her girdle; and the guards immediately seized and imprisoned them. They were afterwards examined by torture, and confessed the whole plot; upon which, <a href=/people/8434 target=_blank>Tirgatao</a> ordered the hostage to be executed, and laid waste the territories of <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> with fire and sword. Stung with remorse for the calamities he had brought upon himself and his country, <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> died in the midst of an unsuccessful war; leaving his son Gorgippus to succeed him in the throne. He renounced his father's proceedings, and sued for peace, which she granted on payment of a tribute, and put and end to the war. </p>                        </div>
