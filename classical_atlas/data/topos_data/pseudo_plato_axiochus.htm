And there is a report that <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> descended to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> after having previously shared in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Mysteries</a> here; and that they put on a boldness for the journey thither from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=demonym long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian</a> (rites). But they, whose life has been passed in a course of evil doings, are driven by the Furies to <a href=/people/933 target=_blank>Erebus</a> and <a href=/people/1434 target=_blank>Chaos</a> through <a href=/people/306 target=_blank>Tartarus</a>, where is the region of the impious, and the unfilled urns of the daughters of <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>, and the thirst of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>! and the entrails of <a href=/people/992 target=_blank>Tityus</a>, and the uncompleted stone of <a href=/people/531 target=_blank>Sisyphus</a>, To whom begins again his labours end.</p>                        </div>

This account did I hear from <a href=/people/1536 target=_blank>Gobryas</a>; and you, <a href=/people/2295 target=_blank>Axiochus</a>, can decide upon it. For carried along myself by reason I know firmly this alone, that the soul is wholly immortal, and that, when it is removed from this spot, it is there without pain; so that it must needs be, <a href=/people/2295 target=_blank>Axiochus</a>, that, if you have lived piously, you will be happy either below or above. <br />AXIOCHUS: I am ashamed, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, to say a word. For so far am I from fearing death, that already I feel a desire for it; so greatly has this beautiful discourse of yours persuaded me, as if it were a heavenly one. And even now I have a contempt for life, as being about to remove to a better home. For the present then I will cast up quietly with myself what has been said; and at mid-day you will be with me, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />SOCRATES: I will do as you say. And for a while I will go back for a walk to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BKyn class=place long=23.732 lat=37.966>Cynosarges</a>, from whence I was sent for hither.</p>                        </div>
