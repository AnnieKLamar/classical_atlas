Their fathers' names I have not added in all cases, God forbid! but only for those who were the sons of illustrious men. For one thing I am aware that the sophist <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> also did not begin with the father's name as a rule, but only in the case of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> mentioned his father, because the thing he had to relate was a marvel, namely, that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s father was a river. And further it would be no great piece of luck for one who desired to be really well informed, to know precisely who was So-and-so's father and mother, yet fail to learn what were the man's own virtues and vices, and in what he succeeded or failed, whether by luck or judgement. This essay of mine, best of proconsuls, will help to lighten the weight of cares on your mind, like <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>'s cup with its <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> drugs.

For it discusses the themes that philosophers treat of, but whereas they, by their method of questioning, set snares for knowledge, and advance step by step as they confirm the minor points of their investigations, but assert that they have still no sure knowledge, the sophist of the old school assumes a knowledge of that whereof he speaks. At any rate, he introduces his speeches with such phrases as I know, or I am aware, or I have long observed, or For mankind there is nothing fixed and sure. This kind of introduction gives a tone of nobility and self-confidence to a speech and implies a clear grasp of the truth. The method of the philosophers resembles the prophetic art which is controlled by man and was organized by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> and, before them, by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>, who used to conjecture the truth by the aid of countless stars; the sophistic method resembles the prophetic art of soothsayers and oracles. For indeed one may hear the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> oracle say: I know the number of the sands of the sea and the measure thereof, and Far-seeing <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> gives a wooden wall to the Tritogenei (thrice-born) and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, <a href=/people/564 target=_blank>Alcmaeon</a>, matricides, and many other things of this sort; just like a sophist. Now ancient sophistic, even when it propounded philosophical themes, used to discuss them diffusely and at length; for it discoursed on courage, it discoursed on justice, on the heroes and gods, and how the universe has been fashioned into its present shape. But the sophistic that followed it, which we must not call new, for it is old, but rather second, sketched the types of the poor man and the rich, of princes and tyrants, and handled arguments that are concerned with definite and special themes for which history shows the way. <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373150PLeo class=person long=14.9981 lat=37.2855>Leontini</a> founded the older type in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, son of <a href=/people/3143 target=_blank>Atrometus</a>, founded the second, after he had been exiled from political life at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and had taken up his abode in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=place long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>; \and the followers of <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> handled their themes with a view to elaborating the methods of their art, while the followers of <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> handled theirs with a view to proving their case. <br />The fountains of extempore eloquence flowed, some say, from <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> their source, and hence <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> has won his great reputation as an orator; but others say that it arose with <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, of whom <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> says that he alone of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> was able to check <a href=/people/826 target=_blank>Python</a>'s insolent and overpowering flow of words; while yet others say that extempore speaking was an invention of <a href=/people/2088 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>; for after he sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> to the court of <a href=/people/1137 target=_blank>Mausolus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar class=person long=28.7 lat=37.01>Caria</a>, he delighted the king by an improvised speech. But my opinion is that <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> did indeed improvise more often than any other speaker, when he went on embassies and gave reports of these missions, and when he defended clients in the courts and delivered political harangues; but I think that he left behind him only such speeches as he had composed with care, for fear that he might fall far short of the elaborate speeches of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, and that it was <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> who founded the art of extempore oratory. For when he appeared in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BDio class=place long=23.7278 lat=37.9703>theatre</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he had the courage to say, Do you propose a theme ; and he was the first to risk this bold announcement, whereby he as good as advertised that he was omniscient and would speak on any subject whatever, trusting to the inspiration of the moment; and I think that this idea occurred to <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> for the following reason. <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376243IKeo class=person long=24.3333 lat=37.6167>Ceos</a> had composed a certain pleasant fable in which <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and <a href=/people/12002 target=_blank>Vice</a> came to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> in the shape of women, one of them dressed in seductive and many-coloured attire, the other with no care for effect; and to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, who was still young, <a href=/people/12002 target=_blank>Vice</a> offered idleness and sensuous pleasures, while <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> offered squalor and toil on toil. For this story <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> wrote a rather long epilogue, and then he toured the cities and gave recitations of the story in public, for hire, and charmed them after the manner of <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> and <a href=/people/1343 target=_blank>Thamyris</a>. <br />For these recitations he won a great reputation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> and a still greater at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, as one who benefited the young by making this fable widely known. Thereupon <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> ridiculed <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> for handling a theme that was stale and hackneyed, and he abandoned himself to the inspiration of the moment. Yet he did not fail to arouse envy. There was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> a certain <a href=/people/1002 target=_blank>Chaerephon</a>, not the one who used to be nicknamed Boxwood in Comedy, because he suffered from anaemia due to hard study, but the one I now speak of had insolent manners and made scurrilous jokes; he rallied <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> for his ambitious efforts, and said: <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>, why is it that beans blow out my stomach, but do not blow up the fire? But he was not at all disconcerted by the question and replied: This I leave for you to investigate; but here is a fact which I have long known, that the earth grows canes for such as you. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> when they observed the too great cleverness of the sophists, shut them out of the lawcourts on the ground that they could defeat a just argument by an unjust, and that they used their power to warp men's judgement. That is the reason why <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> and <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> branded each other with the title of sophist, not because it was a disgrace, but because the very word was suspect in the eyes of the jury; for in their career outside the courts they claimed consideration and applause on the very ground that they were sophists. In fact, <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, if we may believe <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, used to boast to his friends that he had won over the votes of the jury to his own views; while <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> would not, I think, have given the first place to a study of which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=ethnic long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodians</a> knew nothing before his coming, unless he had already devoted serious attention to it at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. <br />The men of former days applied the name sophist, not only to orators whose surpassing eloquence won them a brilliant reputation, but also to philosophers who expounded their theories with ease and fluency. Of these latter, then, I must speak first, because, though they were not actually sophists, they seemed to be so, and hence came to be so called. </p>                        </div>

His style has the ring of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> and <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, but <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a> has besides a peculiar resonance of his own, which enhances theirs as the bridge enhances the tone of musical instruments; and it was combined with a serious and direct simplicity of expression. Again, in <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>'s orations the elements of his own noble character were admirably displayed. For though he very often rebuked licentious cities, he did not show himself acrimonious or ungracious, but like one who restrains an unruly <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> with the bridle rather than the whip; and when he set out to praise cities that were well governed, he did not seem to extol them, but rather to guide their attention to the fact that they would be ruined if they should change their ways. In other connexions also the temper of his philosophy was never vulgar or ironical; and though his attacks were made with a heavy hand, they were tempered and as it were seasoned with benevolence. That he had also a talent for writing history is proved by his treatise On the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>; he did in fact travel as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a> during his wandering as an exile.

But while he planted and dug, drew water for baths and gardens, and performed many such menial tasks for a living, he did not neglect the study of letters, but sustained himself with two books; these were the <a href=/people/1077 target=_blank>Phaedo</a> of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> On the False Embassy. He often visited the military camps in the rags he was wont to wear, and after the assassination of <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, when he saw that the troops were beginning to mutiny, he could not contain himself at the sight of the disorder that had broken out, but stripped off his rags, leaped on to a high altar, and began his harangue with the verse: Then <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> of many counsels stripped him of his rags, and having said this and thus revealed that he was no beggar, nor what they believed him to be, but <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a> the sage, he delivered a spirited and energetic indictment of the tyrant; and he convinced the soldiers that they would be wiser if they acted in accordance with the will of the Roman people. And indeed the persuasive charm of the man was such as to captivate even men who were not versed in Greek letters. An instance of this is that the Emperor <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> set him by his side on the golden chariot in which the Emperors ride in procession when they celebrate their triumphs in war, and often he would turn to <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a> and say: I do not understand what you are saying, but I love you as I love myself. <br />The images employed by <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a> in his orations are entirely in the sophistic manner, but though he abounds in them his style is nevertheless clear and in keeping with the matter in hand. </p>                        </div>

Yet he was so ardent in love that he was actually charged with adultery by a man of consular rank. Though he quarrelled with the Emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, he suffered no ill consequences. Hence he used to say in the ambiguous style of an oracle, that there were in the story of his life these three paradoxes: Though he was a Gaul he led the life of a <a href=/people/1290 target=_blank>Hellene</a>; a eunuch, he had been tried for adultery; he had quarrelled with an Emperor and was still alive.

But when he saw that the Emperor intended to vote against him on the ground that he was not a philosopher, he forestalled him in the following way. O Emperor, he cried, I have had a dream of which you ought to be informed.

However they may be forgiven for that rivalry, since human nature holds that the love of glory never grows old; but they are to be blamed for the speeches that they composed assailing one another; for personal abuse is brutal, and even if it be true, that does not acquit of disgrace even the man who speaks about such things. And so when people called <a href=/people/278 target=_blank>Favorinus</a> a sophist, the mere fact that he had quarrelled with a sophist was evidence enough; for that spirit of rivalry of which I spoke is always directed against one's competitors in the same craft.

For he set an example to the sophists with his virile and energetic style, his daring and unusual expressions, his inspired impressiveness, and his use of the grand style for great themes; and also with his habit of breaking off his clauses and making sudden transitions, by which devices a speech gains in sweetness and sublimity; and he also clothed his style with poetic words for the sake of ornament and dignity.

Moreover, he played a distinguished part at the religious festivals of the Greeks, and declaimed his Pythian Oration from the altar; and for this his statue was dedicated in gold and was set up in the temple of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god. His Olympian Oration dealt with a theme of the highest importance to the state. For, seeing that Greece was divided against itself, he came forward as the advocate of reconciliation, and tried to turn their energies against the barbarians and to persuade them not to regard one another's cities as the prize to be won by their arms, but rather the land of the barbarians. The Funeral Oration, which he delivered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, was spoken in honour of those who had fallen in the wars, to whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> awarded public funerals and panegyrics, and it is composed with extraordinary cleverness.

It is said that though <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> attained to the age of 108, his body was not weakened by old age, but to the end of his life he was in sound condition, and his senses were the senses of a young man. </p>                        </div>

For though the magi invoke the gods in their secret rites, they avoid any public profession of belief in a deity, because they do not wish it to be thought that their own powers are derived from that source.

On the one hand he may be called a good man, for the following reasons. Very often he held commands in war, very often he was victorious; he added to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> navy sixty fully equipped triremes; he was held to be the most able of men, both in the art of speaking and in the invention of themes. On these grounds, then, he deserves praise from me or any other. But on the other hand there are evidently good reasons for regarding him as a bad man, and they are the following. He broke up the democracy; he enslaved the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> people; he sided with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, secretly at first, but openly later on; and he let loose on the public life of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> the mob of the Four Hundred Tyrants.

For, say they, his father was <a href=/people/2070 target=_blank>Sophilus</a> who taught the art of composing rhetorical speeches and educated the son of <a href=/people/810 target=_blank>Cleinias</a>, as well as other men of great influence. </p>                        </div>

The nature of this charge I will proceed to explain. In the case of other branches of science and the arts, men pay honour to those who have won distinction in any one of these fields; that is to say, they pay more honour to physicians who are skilful than to those who are less skilful; in the arts of divination and music they admire the expert, and for carpentering and all the inferior trades they cast the same sort of vote; only in the ease of rhetoric, even while they praise it they suspect it of being rascally and mercenary and constituted in despite of justice. And it is not only the crowd who so regard this art, but also the most distinguished among the men of sound culture. At any rate they apply the term clever rhetorician to those who show skill in the invention of themes and their exposition, thus attaching a far from flattering label to this particular excellence. Seeing that such conditions exist, it was, I think, not unnatural that <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a> like the rest should become a theme for Comedy; for it is just the things which deserve to be a theme that Comedy makes fun of. </p>                        </div>

For he used to run down the tragedies of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, though <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> prided himself more on these than on his power as a tyrant; and once when the tyrant was interested in finding out where the best kind of bronze was produced, and asked the bystanders what continent or island produced the best bronze, <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a>, who happened to be there, said The best I know of is at Athens, of which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237AHaA class=place long=23.7234 lat=37.97513>statues</a> of <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a> have been made. The result of this behaviour was that he was put to death on the charge of plotting against <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> and turning the Sicilians against him. And <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a> was in the wrong, in the first place, for provoking a collision with a tyrant under whom he had chosen to live rather than be under a democracy at home; secondly he was wrong in trying to free the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, whereas he had tried to enslave the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. Furthermore, in diverting <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> from writing tragedy he really diverted him from being easy-going; for pursuits of that sort belong to an easy temper, and their subjects may well prefer tyrants when they are slack rather than when they are strung up. For when they slacken their energies they will put fewer men to death, they will do less violence and plunder less; so that a tyrant who occupies himself with tragedies may be likened to a physician who is sick, but is trying to heal himself. For the writing of myths and monodies and choric rhythms and the representation of characters, the greater part of which necessarily present what is morally good, diverts tyrants from their own implacable and violent temper as taking medicines diverts the course of disease. What I have just said we must not regard as an indictment of <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a>, but rather as advice to all men not to provoke tyrants against themselves, or excite to wrath their savage dispositions. </p>                        </div>

But let me declare my opinion that no human being can be said to have died nobly for a cause that he took up in defiance of the right. And I believe that this is the reason why this man's wisdom and his writings are held in slight esteem by the Greeks; for unless our public utterances and our moral character are in accord, we shall seem, like flutes, to speak with a tongue that is not our own. As regards the style of his oratory, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> abounded in brief and sententious sayings, and he was most skilful in the use of elevated language, but not of the dithyrambic sort, nor did he have recourse to words borrowed from poetry; but his was the kind of elevated language that is composed of the most appropriate words and is not artificial. I observe, moreover, that he was a master of concise eloquence, and that even when he maintained the tone proper to a speech in defence, he used to make vigorous attacks on his opponent; and that he Atticized, but in moderation, nor did he use outlandish words — for bad taste in Atticizing is truly barbarous — but his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> words shine through his discourse like the gleams of the sun's rays. <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> also secures a charming effect by passing without connectives from one part of his speech to another. Then, too, <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> strives for the daring and unusual both in thought and expression, yet his eloquence is somewhat lacking in virility, though it is agreeable and smooth, like the breath of the west wind. </p>                        </div>

'The <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Siren</a> which stands on the tomb of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> the sophist — its pose is that of one singing — testifies to the man's persuasive charm, which he combined with the conventions and customs of rhetoric. For though he was not the inventor of clauses that exactly balance, antitheses, and similar endings, since they had already been invented, nevertheless he employed those devices with great skill. He also paid great attention to rhetorical amplification, rhythm, structure, and a striking effect, and in fact it was by his study of these very things that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> achieved his eloquence. For though <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> was a pupil of <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>, it was on <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> that he modelled himself, but he surpassed him in fire and impetuosity, in amplification, and in rapidity both of speech and thought. Again, the grand style in <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> is more vigorous, while in <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> it is more refined and suave. Let me give a specimen of the grand style of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>: For to all mankind the end of life is death, though a man keep himself shut up in a closet; yet it is the duty of brave men ever to set their hands to all honourable tasks, setting their good hope before them as their shield, and endure nobly whatever comes from the hand of God.! With <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> on the other hand, the grand style is ornate, as in the following: For since the whole earth that lies beneath the heavens is divided into two parts, and one is called Asia, the other Europe, he has received by the treaty one half thereof, as though he were dividing the territory with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. He shrank from political life and did not attend political assemblies, partly because his voice was not strong enough, partly because of the jealous distrust that in politics at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was always especially opposed to those who had a talent above the average for public speaking. Yet in spite of this he took a strong interest in public affairs. Hence in the letters that he addressed to <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> he tried to reconcile him with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; in his writings on peace he tried to wean the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from their maritime policy, on the ground that they thereby injured their reputation; and there is also his Panegyric which he delivered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, when he tried to persuade Greece to cease from domestic quarrels and make war on Asia. This oration, though it is the finest of all, nevertheless gave rise to the charge that it had been compiled from the works of <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> on the same subject. The most skilfully composed of all the works of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> are the <a href=/people/239 target=_blank>Archidamus</a> and the speech called Without Witnesses. For the former is animated throughout by the desire to revive men's courage and spirit after the defeat at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383231ULeu class=place long=23.1717 lat=38.2567>Leuctra</a>, and not only is its language exquisitely chosen, but its composition is brilliant also, and the whole speech is in the style of a legal argument; so that even the myth in it, the story of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, is expressed with vigour and energy.

The whole government at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was divided into two parties, of which one was friendly to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king, the other to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>.

For between temperaments that are antagonistic to one another there grows up a hatred that has no other grounds. And naturally antagonistic the two men were, for the following reasons. <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> was a lover of wine, had agreeable and easy manners, and was endowed with all the charm of a follower of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>; and in fact while he was still a mere boy, he actually played minor parts for ranting tragic actors. <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, on the other hand, had a gloomy expression and an austere brow, and was a water-drinker; hence he was reckoned an ill-tempered and unsociable person, and especially so when the two men along with others went on an embassy to <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, and as messmates the one showed himself pliant and amiable to his fellow-ambassadors, while the other was stiff and dry and took everything too seriously. And their quarrel was intensified by the discussions about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408238PAmp class=place long=23.847 lat=40.822>Amphipolis</a> in <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s presence, when <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> broke down in his speech; but <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> . . . was not one of those who ever throw away the shield, as is evident when one considers the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385241UTam class=place long=24.1042 lat=38.4994>Tamynae</a>, when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=ethnic long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotians</a>.

And after he had been nominated as a deputy to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Pylae</a> he did not escape suspicion from most men of having himself prompted <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> to seize <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386228PEla class=place long=22.783 lat=38.646>Elatea</a>, by his action in stirring up the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Pylae</a> with his specious words and fables. He secretly left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, not because he had been ordered to go into exile, but in order to avoid the political disgrace which he had incurred when he failed to secure the necessary votes in his suit against <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> and <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a>. It was his purpose, when he set out on his journey, to go to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, since the latter was on the point of arriving at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>. But when he touched at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> he learned that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was dead, and that therefore things were greatly disturbed in Asia, so he took up his abode at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, for the island is well adapted to literary pursuits, and having transformed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> into a school for sophists, he continued to live there, sacrificing to peace and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, and introducing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> customs into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> mode of life. </p>                        </div>

For hitherto the inspired manner in oratory had not become a regular device of the sophists, but it dates from <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, who extemporized as though he were carried away by a divine impulse, like one who exhales oracles. He was a pupil of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a>, but his success was due in great part to natural talent. For in his orations shines the light of perfect lucidity, he is at once sublime and seductive, energetic and delightful, and in a word his sort of eloquence defies the efforts of those who would imitate it. There are three orations of <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>; but some ascribe to him a fourth besides, On <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>, though it does no credit to his eloquence.

Accordingly we must limit the eloquence of <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> to three orations, which are: Against <a href=/people/296 target=_blank>Timarchus</a>, In Defence of the Embassy, and the speech Against <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a>. There is also extant a fourth work of his, the Letters, which, though they are few, are full of learning and character. What that character was he clearly showed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>. For once after he had read in public his speech Against <a href=/people/231 target=_blank>Ctesiphon</a>, they were expressing their surprise that he had been defeated after so able a speech, and were criticizing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> as out of their senses, but <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> said: You would not marvel thus if you had heard <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> in reply to these arguments.

Though he was deemed worthy of the highest honour in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, which left nothing unsaid in its loud praise of him as a marvellous man and a great orator, he seldom came forward to speak in the public assembly; and when the crowd accused him of being afraid: I am more afraid, said he, of the public when they praise than when they abuse me. And once when a tax-collector behaved insolently to him in the law court, and said: Stop barking at me, <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a> replied with ready wit: I will, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, if you too will stop biting me. His journey beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> was made at the command of the Emperor, and the reason for it was as follows. A consul named <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> was governing <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> with great harshness and malevolence, and <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a> having come into collision with him in a certain matter, said Good day to him and did not again appear before his court. Now so long as <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> was procurator of only one city, he did not take serious offence at this behaviour; but when he became prefect of the armies in Gaul his anger revived in his memory; for men are uplifted by success in various ways, but especially they refuse any longer to tolerate things that, before their success, when they used ordinary human standards, they used to tolerate. Accordingly he wrote to the Emperor <a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a>, bringing many serious charges against <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a>, to which the Emperor replied: You shall yourself hear him in his own defence, and if you find him guilty do you fix the penalty. Now in writing thus he was not abandoning <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a>, but rather preparing the mind of <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> for forgiveness, since he thought that he would never put to death so worthy a man if the decision were in his hands, nor indeed inflict any other penalty on him, lest he should appear harsh and vindictive to him who had appointed him his enemy's judge. It was therefore on this account that <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a> went to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/507071WRhi class=place long=7.1111 lat=50.736>Rhine</a> and to Gaul, and when he came forward to make his defence he impressed <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> so profoundly that the tears he shed over <a href=/people/2173 target=_blank>Nicetes</a> amounted to more than the water that had been allotted to him for his defence; and he sent him away not only unscathed, but singled out for honour even among the most illustrious of the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>.

But when he attained to manhood he so transformed himself as to be thought to have become another person, for he discarded both from his countenance and his mind the frivolity that had seemed to come to the surface in him; no longer did he, even in the theatre, hearken to the sounds of the lyre and the flute; he put off his transparent garments and his many-coloured cloaks, reduced his table, and left off his amours as though he had lost the eyes he had before. For instance, when <a href=/people/2378 target=_blank>Ardys</a> the rhetorician asked him whether he considered some woman or other handsome, <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a> replied with much discretion: I have ceased to suffer from eye trouble. And when someone asked him what sort of bird and what sort of fish were the best eating: I have ceased, replied <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>, to take these matters seriously, for I now know that used to feed on the gardens of <a href=/people/383 target=_blank>Tantalus</a>.

The style of eloquence that he practised was neither exuberant nor meagre, but simple and natural and suited to the subject matter.

For they say that he is unworthy of the sophistic circle and call him dithyrambic, intemperate in his style, and thick-witted. Those who say this about him are quibblers and sluggish and are not inspired with extempore eloquence; for man is by nature a creature prone to envy. At any rate the short disparage the tall, the ill-favoured the good-looking, those who are slow and lame disparage the light-footed swift runner, cowards the brave, the unmusical the musical, those who are unathletic disparage athletes.

And this is a great crown of glory and more than great wealth. He was one of twins, and as both were lying in one cradle, when they were five days old, one of them was struck by lightning, but the other, though he was lying with the stricken child, was not maimed in any one of his senses. And yet, so fierce and sulphurous was the fire of the thunderbolt that some of those who stood near were killed by the shock, others suffered injury to their ears and eyes, while the minds of others were affected by the shock of the bolt. But <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> was afflicted by none of these misfortunes, for he remained healthy and sound far on into old age. I will explain the reason why I marvel at this. Once, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=place long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, eight harvesters were eating their meal beneath a great oak, near that part of the island called the Horn — this place is a harbour curved in the shape of slender horns — when a cloud covered the oak and a bolt was hurled on to it, so that the tree itself was struck, and the harvesters, when the stroke fell on them, were killed every one of them in the act of doing whatever it might be, one as he lifted a cup, one drinking, one kneading bread, one while eating, in fact, whatever else it might be that they were engaged on, thus in the act they lost their lives; and they were covered with smoke and blackened like bronze statues that are near hot springs and so become darkened by fumes. But <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> was reared under the protection of the gods so carefully that he not only escaped death from the thunderbolt, though not even the most robust of those field-labourers escaped it, but remained with his senses unimpaired, keen-witted, and independent of sleep, and in fact he was never subject even to a feeling of torpor. </p>                        </div>

After the death of <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>'s mother, the old man was preparing to bring home a woman as a concubine and not in legal wedlock, and when the son perceived this he admonished him and tried to deter him, which is always an annoying thing to older men. The woman thereupon trumped up a tale against him to the effect that he was in love with her, and could not endure his lack of success. In this calumny she had also a slave as accomplice, the old man's cook whose name was <a href=/people/5593 target=_blank>Cytherus</a>, and he used to flatter his master, like a slave in a play, and say things of this sort: Master, your son wishes you to die now at once, nor will he allow to your old age a natural death, such as must needs be, not long hence; and he himself is preparing the plot, but he is trying to hire the help of my hands as well. For he has poisonous drugs destined for you, and he orders me to put the most deadly of them in one of my dishes, promising me my freedom, lands, houses, money, and whatever I may please to have from your house; and this, if I obey; but if I disobey he promises me the lash, torture, stout fetters, and the cruel pillory. </p>                        </div>

And this indeed need not surprise us, since he whom he beguiled was an amorous old man, who was perhaps feeble-minded besides, from old age and from that same passion — for even when young men are in love there is not one of them that keeps his wits — but the surprising thing is that he showed himself more than a match for the oratorical talent of <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>, and his high reputation, in the law courts; for he went to law with him over the will, and used <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>'s own fortune to counteract the latter's talent. For by drawing deeply on the estate and bribing with extravagant sums the tongues of all men, and at the same time the votes of the jury, he won a complete victory on every point, and hence <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> used to say that, whereas the property of <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> had become a <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> pasture, his own was a slave pasture. <a href=/people/5593 target=_blank>Cytherus</a> became prominent in public life also, and when he was now an old man and saw that his estate was growing less and that he himself was greatly despised, nay had even received blows at the hands of a man from whom he tried to recover money, he implored <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> to lay aside the memory of his wrongs and his anger, and to take back his father's property, only giving up to himself a part of the house, which was spacious, so that he might live in it without too great squalor; and to yield to him also two fields out of those near the sea.

In the law courts he displayed a temper neither avaricious nor malevolent. For without a fee he would champion the cause of those who were in danger of their lives, and when men became abusive in their speeches, and thought fit to make a great display of indignation, he used to call them tipsy and frenzied old hags. Though he charged a fee for declaiming, it was not the same for every pupil, and depended on the amount of property possessed by each. And he used to appear before his audience with no arrogance or conceited airs, nor again with the bearing of a timid speaker, but as befitted one who was entering the lists to win glory for himself and was confident that he could not fail. He would argue with suavity, so long as he was seated, but when he stood up to speak his oration became more impressive and gained in vigour. He meditated his theme neither in private nor before his audience, but he would withdraw and in a very short time would review all his arguments.

It is said that at these times he would sway to and fro more than usual, as though in a Bacchic frenzy, and when one of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s pupils said of him that he beat a loud drum, <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> took to himself the sneering jest and retorted: Yes, I do beat a drum, but it is the shield of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>. He went on many embassies to the Emperor, and while a peculiar good luck ever accompanied his missions as ambassador, his most successful was that on behalf of the vines. For this embassy was sent, not as in most cases on behalf of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> alone, but on behalf of all Asia in general. I will relate the aim of the embassy. The Emperor resolved that there should be no vines in Asia, because it appeared that the people when under the influence of wine plotted revolution; those that had been already planted were to be pulled up, and they were to plant no more in future. There was clearly need of an embassy to represent the whole community, and of a man who in their defence, like another <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> or <a href=/people/1343 target=_blank>Thamyris</a>, would charm his hearer. Accordingly they unanimously selected <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>, and on this mission he succeeded so far beyond their hopes that he returned bringing not only the permission to plant, but actually the threat of penalties for those who should neglect to do so. How great a reputation he won in this contest on behalf of the vines is evident from what he said, for the oration is among the most celebrated; and it is evident too from what happened as a result of the oration. For by it he won such presents as are usually given at an imperial court, and also many compliments and expressions of praise, and moreover a brilliant band of youths fell in love with his genius and followed him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>. </p>                        </div>

For this reason he rejoiced at <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>'s visit. For when he heard him speak and handle an extempore discourse, by his example he became fledged and fully equipped, and with the idea of pleasing his father he invited him to hear him give a declamation in the same style as their guest. His father greatly admired his imitation and gave him fifty talents, while to <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> himself he gave fifteen; but <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> besides gave him from his own present the same sum as had been bestowed by his father, and called him his teacher. And when he heard this title from <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> it was sweeter to him than the springs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385281WPac class=place long=28.0628 lat=38.4804>Pactolus</a>.

The citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> needed someone to go on an embassy for them, and the mission was on affairs of the greatest moment. But he was now growing old and was past the age for travelling, and therefore <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> was elected, though he had never before acted as ambassador. So in offering up prayers for good luck, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> begged that he might be granted the persuasive charm of <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>, embraced him before the assembly, and applied very aptly to him the verses from the exploits of <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>: Give me thy harness to buckle about my shoulders, if perchance they may take me for thee. <a href=/people/59 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378346PTya class=person long=34.57 lat=37.82>Tyana</a> also, who in wisdom surpassed mere human achievement, ranks <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> among the men to be admired. </p>                        </div>

For to have recourse to one's ancestors is the mark of those who despair of applause for themselves. He was a pupil of <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>, that is of one who, as I have said, employed a natural style, and of this style he successfully took the impressment of his thoughts besides; for this too was characteristic of <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>. And though he presented his ideas with honeyed sweetness, he was not intemperate in the use of pleasing effects, like some of the sophists, but was economical with them, and would always say to his pupils that honey should be tasted with the finger-tip and not by the handful. This indeed is clearly shown in all the speeches delivered by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, whether critical works or forensic or moral disputations, but above all in the Dirge for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>. For when representing <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> as he denounced himself before the Senate after <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>, he ended his speech with this monody: O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>, wicked city! and again: O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> that hast deserted to the barbarians!

As for the story that is told about him that he used to train his pupils in mnemonics by the help of <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> arts, I will show the source of the tradition. There is no such thing as an art of memory, nor could there be, for though memory gives us the arts, it cannot itself be taught, nor can it be acquired by any method or system, since it is a gift of nature or a part of the immortal soul. For never could human beings be regarded as endowed with immortality, nor could what we have learned be taught, did not <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a> inhabit the minds of men. And I will not dispute with the poets whether we ought to call her the mother of Time or the daughter, but let that be as they please. Moreover, who that is enrolled among the wise would be so foolishly careless of his own reputation as to use magic arts with his pupils, and so bring into disrepute also what has been taught by correct methods? How was it then that his pupils had a peculiar gift of memory? It was because the declamations of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> gave them a pleasure of which they could never have enough, and he was compelled to repeat them very often, since he knew that they were delighted to hear them. And so the more ready-witted of these youths used to engrave them on their minds, and when, by long practice rather than by sheer memory, they had thoroughly grasped them, they used to recite them to the rest; and hence they came to be called the memory-artists, and men who made it into an art. It is on these grounds that some people say that the declamations of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> are a collection of odds and ends, for they say one person added this, another that, where he had been concise. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> was beginning to grow old and enjoyed the most distinguished reputation, and <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, on the other hand, was attaining to the height of his career, though he was not yet personally known to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> paid a visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> to plead a case before the Centumviri who had jurisdiction over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a>. And towards evening <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a> and asked <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a> the critic, who was his host: Tell me, <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a>, what is <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> doing here?

What a stroke of luck is this! cried <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, that I shall actually be able to hear <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, for I have never yet had a chance to judge of him. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a> remarked: The young man seems to make you uneasy by his rapid advance to a great reputation. Yes, by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> said <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, he does not even allow me to sleep. He makes my heart palpitate, and my mind too, when I think how many admirers he has. For some think that from his lips flow twelve springs, others measure his tongue by cubits, like the risings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>. But you might cure this anxiety for me by telling me what are the respective superiorities and defects that you have observed in us both. <a href=/people/981 target=_blank>Dorion</a> replied with great discretion: You yourself, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, will be better able to judge between yourself and him, for you are well qualified by your wisdom not only to know yourself but also to observe another accurately. <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> heard <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> defend the suit, and as he left the court he remarked: This athlete possesses strength, but it does not come from the wrestling ground. When <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> heard this he came to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>' door and announced that he would declaim before him.

In his oratory brilliant passages flare out and suddenly come to an end like a flash of lightning. This is evident in all that he wrote, but especially in the example that I now quote. His theme was to denounce <a href=/people/558 target=_blank>Leptines</a> on account of his law, because the supply of corn had failed to reach the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>; and he wound up as follows: The mouth of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> has been locked up by a law, and a few syllables keep back the food supply of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; so that <a href=/people/107 target=_blank>Lysander</a> fighting with his ships and <a href=/people/558 target=_blank>Leptines</a> fighting with his law have the same power. Again, when his theme was to oppose the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, when in a scarcity of funds they were planning to sell the islands, he declaimed with energy the following: Take back, <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, the favour that you granted to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>! Permit her, while we are selling her, to make her escape! In his extempore speeches he imitated <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>, whose pupil he had been. He used to charge handsome fees, and in his classes he not only declaimed but also taught the rules of the art. There are two statues of him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, one in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, the other in the small grove which he is said to have planted himself. </p>                        </div>

Nor must I omit to speak of Marcus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, on whose behalf I will bring this reproach against the Greeks, that though he was as talented as I shall show, he does not as vet receive the honour that he deserves. The genealogy of Marcus dated back as far as the original <a href=/people/5523 target=_blank>Byzas</a>, and his father, who had the same name, owned slaves who were fishermen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a>. (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a> is near the entrance to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>.) His teacher was <a href=/people/357 target=_blank>Isaeus</a>, and from him he learned the natural style of oratory, but he adorned it with a charming suavity. The most characteristic example of the style of Marcus is his speech of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> advising the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> not to receive the men who had returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369217ISph class=place long=21.6657 lat=36.9301>Sphacteria</a> without their weapons. He began this argument as follows: As a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a> who till old age has kept his shield, I would gladly have slain these men who have lost theirs. His style in his discourses may be gathered from the following. He was trying to show how rich and how many-sided is the art of the sophists, and taking the rainbow as the image of an oration, he began his discourse thus: He who sees the rainbow only as a single colour does not see a sight to marvel at, but he who sees how many colours it has, marvels more. Those who ascribe this discourse to <a href=/people/1392 target=_blank>Alcinous</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a> fail to observe the style of his speech, they fail to observe the truth, and are most dishonest men, in that they try to rob the sophist even of what he wrote about his own art. </p>                        </div>

This was evident from the steady gaze of his eyes which were usually intent on secret thoughts, and, moreover, it was admitted by the man himself. For when one of his friends asked him how he declaimed the day before, he replied: To myself, well enough, but to my pupils not so well. And when the other expressed surprise at the answer, Marcus said: I work even when I am silent, and I keep myself in practice with two or three arguments beside the one that I maintain in public.

For, when he had already made his reputation, he once visited <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s school, and when the pupils who had come to attend the lecture had taken their seats, one of those who had made the voyage to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> recognized him and pointed him out to the man next him, and he in turn to his neighbour, and so word was handed on to them all that he was the sophist from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>. Accordingly, when <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> asked for themes to be proposed, they all turned towards Marcus that he might propose one. And when <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> asked: Why do you look to the rustic?

Thereupon <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, who recognized him partly by his <a href=/people/476 target=_blank>Doric</a> dialect, addressed himself to Marcus in a long and wonderful speech on the spur of the moment, and when he had declaimed and heard the other declaim he both admired and was admired.

For the people having from his boyhood observed in him a certain greatness, heaped on the head of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> all the wreaths of honour that were theirs to give, decreeing for himself and his family the distinctions most sought after in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>; for they bestowed on him and his descendants the right to preside over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games founded by <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, and to go on board the sacred trireme. For in the month <a href=/people/4844 target=_blank>Anthesterion</a> a trireme in full sail is brought in procession to the agora, and the priest of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, like a pilot, steers it as it comes from the sea, loosing its cables. By opening his school at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> he benefited the city in the following ways. In the first place he made her appear far more populous than before, since the youth flowed into her from both continents and the islands; nor were they a dissolute and promiscuous rabble, but select and genuinely Hellenic. Secondly, he brought about a harmonious government free from faction. For, before that, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> was rent by factions, and the inhabitants of the higher district were at variance with those on the sea-shore. Also he proved to be of great value to the city by going on embassies to the Emperors and defending the community. <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, at any rate, had hitherto favoured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, but <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> so entirely converted him to the cause of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> that in one day he lavished a million drachmae on the city, and with this the corn-market was built, a gymnasium which was the most magnificent of all those in Asia, and a temple that can be seen from afar, the one on the promontory that seems to challenge <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386265LMim class=place long=26.4695 lat=38.5885>Mimas</a>. Moreover, when they made mistakes in their public policy, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> would rebuke them, and often gave them wise advice; thus he was of great use to them, and at the same time he cured them of arrogance and every kind of insolence, an achievement that has all the greater because it was not like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> to reform his ancient customs. He helped them also in the following manner. The suits which they brought against one another he did not allow to be carried anywhere abroad, but he would settle them at home. I mean the suits about money, for those against adulterers, sacrilegious persons and murderers, the neglect of which breeds pollution, he not only urged them to carry them out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> but even to drive them out. For he said that they needed a judge with a sword in his hand. Though he excited the disapproval of many, because when he travelled he was followed by a long train of baggage-animals and many <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, many slaves and many different breeds of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> for various kinds of hunting, while he himself would ride in a chariot from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> or Gaul, with silver-mounted bridles, by all this he acquired glory for. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>. For just as its market-place and a splendid array of buildings reflect lustre on a city, so does an opulent establishment; for not only does a city give a man renown, but itself acquires it from a man. <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> administered the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> as well, for he often visited his relatives there, and gave what assistance he could in public affairs. </p>                        </div>

I must relate how this happened. <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> was proconsul of the whole of Asia without exception, and once he took up his lodging in <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s house because it was the best in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> and belonged to the most notable citizen. However, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> arrived home at night from a journey and raised an outcry at the door that he was outrageously treated in being shut out of his own house, and next he compelled <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> to move to another house. The Emperor was informed of this, but he held no inquiry into the affair, lest he should reopen the wound. But in considering what would happen after his death, and that even mild natures are often provoked by persons who are too aggressive and irritating, he became anxious about <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>. Accordingly in his last testament on the affairs of the Empire, he wrote: And <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, the sophist, advised me to make this arrangement. By this means he opened the way for him to win favour as a benefactor, and forgiveness enough and to spare. And in fact <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> used to jest with <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> about what had happened in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, thus showing that he had by no means forgotten it, though by the honours with which he exalted him on every occasion he seemed to pledge himself not to bear it in mind. This is the sort of jest he would make. When <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> embraced him, and then said: Give <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> a lodging and do not let anyone turn him out of it. And once when a tragic actor who had performed at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games in Asia, over which <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> presided, declared that he would prosecute him, because <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> had expelled him at the beginning of the play, the Emperor asked the actor what time it was when he was expelled from the theatre, and when he replied that it happened to be at noon, the Emperor made this witty comment: But it was midnight when he expelled me from his house, and I did not prosecute him. Let this suffice to show how mild an Emperor could be, and how arrogant a mere man. For in truth <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> was so arrogant that he conversed with cities as his inferiors, Emperors as not his superiors, and the gods as his equals. For instance, when he gave a display to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> of extempore speeches on first coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, he did not condescend to utter an encomium on the city, though there were so many things that one might say in honour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>; nor did he make a long oration about his own renown, although this style of speech is likely to win favour for sophists in their public declamations. But since he well knew that the natural disposition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> needs to be held in check rather than encouraged to greater pride, this was his introductory speech: Men say, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, that as an audience you are accomplished judges of oratory. I shall soon find out. And once when the ruler of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=place long=36.66 lat=45.36>Bosporus</a>, a man who had been trained in all the culture of Greece, came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> in order to learn about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> not only did not take his place among those who went to salute him, but even when the other begged him to visit him he postponed it again and again, until he compelled the king to come to his door with a fee of ten talents. Again, when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a> suffering from a disease of the joints, he slept in the temple, and when <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a> appeared to him and told him to abstain from drinking anything cold, My good sir, said <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, but what if you were doctoring a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>? This proud and haughty temper he contracted from <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a>' the philosopher, with whom he associated for four years when he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>. It would do no harm to describe <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a> also. This man came from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and his birthplace was <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heraclea</a> whose citizens admire Greek culture. At first he devoted himself to the study of writings on medicine and was well versed in the theories of <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> and <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>. But when he had once heard <a href=/people/833 target=_blank>Euphrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, he set full sail for his kind of philosophy. </p>                        </div>

His language was fluent, vigorous and ready, and it was on this account that <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, who loved this headlong style of oratory, valued him so highly. At any rate, when a quarrel arose between <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a> and <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>, because the latter had become addicted to the use of pitch-plasters and professional hair removers; the youths who were then residing in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> took different sides, but <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, who was the pupil of both men, became one of the faction of <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a> and called him the father of my eloquence. And when he was defending himself before <a href=/people/250 target=_blank>Timocrates</a> for his speeches against <a href=/people/278 target=_blank>Favorinus</a>, he cowered before him in awe and submission, like boys who fear blows from their teachers when they have been disobedient. This same humility <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> showed also towards <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> somewhat later, when he was elected to go on an embassy on behalf of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, and begged for <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>'s power of persuasion as though it were the arms of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>.

I wish to relate how this came about, for it is a good story and worth remembering. <br /><a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, you must know, felt a keener desire to succeed in extempore speaking than to be called a consul and the descendant of consuls, and so, before he was acquainted with <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> in order to study with him. It was at the time when <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> alone was regulating the status of the free cities. When he had embraced <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> and saluted him very affectionately by kissing him on the mouth, he asked: Father, when shall I hear you declaim? Now <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> thought that he would put off the declamation and would say that he hesitated to run any risks in the presence of so great a man, but <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, without any such pretext, replied: Hear me declaim today, and let us be going. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> says that when he heard this, he was struck with admiration of the man and the ready facility both of his tongue and brain. This incident illustrates <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s pride and, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the cleverness with which he was wont to dazzle his hearers, but the following shows equally his modesty and sense of propriety. For when the other arrived to hear him declaim, he received him with a long and appropriate panegyric on the words and deeds of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. </p>                        </div>

He would come forward to declaim with a countenance serene and full of confidence, and he always arrived in a litter, because his joints were already diseased. When a theme had been proposed, he did not meditate on it in public but would withdraw from the crowd for a short time. His utterance was clear and incisive, and there was a fine ringing sound in the tones of his voice. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> says also that he used to rise to such a pitch of excitement that he would jump up from his chair when he came to the most striking conclusions in his argument, and whenever he rounded off a period he would utter the final clause with a smile, as though to show clearly that he could deliver it without effort, and at certain places in the argument he would stamp the ground just like the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> adds that he listened to his first declamation like an impartial judge, to the second like one who longs for more, to the third as one who can but admire; and that he attended his lectures for three days. Moreover, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> has recorded the themes of the declamations at which he was present. The first was: <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> swears that he did not take the bribe of fifty talents the charge which <a href=/people/570 target=_blank>Demades</a> brought against him, on the ground that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had communicated this fact to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, having learned it from the account-books of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. In the second, on the conclusion of peace after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> war, he urged: That the trophies erected by the Greeks should be taken down. The third argument was to persuade the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to return to their demes after the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403266UAig class=place long=26.611 lat=40.35>Aegos Potami</a>. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> says that in payment for this he sent him 150,000 drachmae, and called this the fee for his lectures. But since he did not accept it, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> thought that he had been treated with contempt, but <a href=/people/3050 target=_blank>Munatius</a> the critic, when drinking with him (this man came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=place long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Tralles</a>), remarked: <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, I think that <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> dreamed of 250,000 drachmae, and so thinks that he is being stinted because you did not send so large a sum. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> says that he added the 100,000 drachmae, and that <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> took the money without the least hesitation, as though he were receiving only what was his due. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> gave <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> leave not to appear after him to give an exhibition of his oratory, and not to have to maintain a theme after him, and allowed him to depart from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> by night, lest he should be compelled to do this, since <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> thought it outrageous to be compelled to do anything. And from that time forward he never failed to commend <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, and to think him beyond praise. For instance, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, when <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> had brilliantly maintained the argument about the war trophies, and was being complimented on the fluency and vigour of his speech, he said: Read <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s declamation, and then you will know a great man. And at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games when all Greece acclaimed him, crying: You are the equal of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>! he replied: I wish I were the equal of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a>, applying this name to <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> because in those days <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> counted as part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>. </p>                        </div>

And when <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> the consul asked him what teachers he had had, he replied: This man and that, while I was being taught, but <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, when I was teaching others. <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> says that he studied also with <a href=/people/674 target=_blank>Dio</a>, and that in order to do so he paid a visit to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>. He used to say that the works of prose writers needed to be brought out by armfuls, but the works of poets by the wagon-load. Among the honours that he received were also the following. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> was contending on behalf of her temples and their rights, and when he had already reached the last stage of his life, appointed <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> as one of her advocates. But since he died at the very outset of the journey to defend those rights, the city was entrusted to other advocates. Before the imperial tribunal they presented their case very badly, whereupon the Emperor looked towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> and said: Had not <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> been appointed as your public advocate in this suit? Yes they replied, if you mean the sophist. Then, perhaps said the Emperor, he wrote down some speech in defence of your rights, inasmuch as he was to speak for the defence in my presence and on behalf of such great issues. Perhaps, O Emperor, they replied, but not as far as we know. Whereupon the Emperor adjourned the case until the speech could be brought, and when it had been read aloud in court the Emperor gave his decision in accordance with it; and so <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> carried off the victory, and the citizens departed declaring that <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> had come to life to help them. </p>                        </div>

There was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> youth who was indulging in a life of dissipation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> to a degree not customary with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, and was being ruined by his great wealth, which is a vicious teacher of ill-regulated natures. Now the youth's name was <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, and he had been so spoiled by parasites that he had convinced himself that he was the fairest of the fair, the tallest of the tall, and the noblest and most expert of the youths at the wrestling-ground, and that not even the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> could strike up a prelude more sweetly than he, whenever he had a mind to sing. He had the same notions about the sophists; that is to say, that he could outstrip even their tongues whenever he declaimed — and he actually used to declaim — and those who borrowed money from him used to reckon their attendance at his declamations as part of the interest. Even <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, when he was still a young man and not yet an invalid, was induced to pay this tribute, for he had borrowed money from him, and when he did not pay court to him or attend his lectures, the youth resented it and threatened him with a summons to recover the debt. This summons is a writ issued by the law court proclaiming judgement by default against the debtor who fails to pay. Thereupon his friends reproached <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> with being morose and discourteous, seeing that when he could avoid being sued and could profit by the young man's money by merely giving him an amiable nod of approval, he would not do this, but provoked and irritated him. </p>                        </div>

On another occasion, when the consul was putting to the torture a bandit who had been convicted on several charges, and declared that he could not think of any penalty for him that would match his crimes, <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> who was present said: Order him to learn by heart some antiquated stuff. For though this sophist had learned by heart a great number of passages, he nevertheless considered that this is the most wearisome of all exercises. Again, on seeing a gladiator dripping with sweat out of sheer terror of the life-and-death struggle before him, he remarked: You are in as great an agony as though you were going to declaim. Again, when he met a sophist who was buying sausages, sprats, and other cheap dainties of that sort, he said: My good sir, it is impossible for one who lives on this diet to act convincingly the arrogance of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> and <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0638.tlg003:1.25.9'><b>&sect; 1.25.9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>'s style of eloquence is passionate, combative, and ringing to the echo, like the trumpet at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games. The Demosthenic cast of his thought lends it distinction and a gravity which is not dull or inert but brilliant and inspired, as though delivered from the tripod. But they fail to understand the man who say that he handles invective more skilfully than any other sophist, but is less skilful in making a defence. Such a criticism is proved to be untrue by this and that declamation in which he speaks for the defence, but especially by the speech in which <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> swears that he did not accept the fifty talents. For in establishing a defence so difficult to make, his ornate rhetoric and technical skill were fully equal to the argument. I observe the same error in the case of those who hold that he was not qualified to sustain simulated arguments, but was forced off the course like a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> for whom the ground is too rough, and that he deprecated the use of these themes when he quoted the maxim of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: For hateful to me even as the gates of hell is he that hideth one thing in his heart and uttereth another. Perhaps he used to say this with a double meaning, and to illustrate by this allusion how intractable are such themes; nevertheless, these too he sustained with great skill, as is evident from his Adulterer Unmasked or his <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> refuses to survive <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>; or his <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> demands that his laws be rescinded after <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> has obtained a bodyguard. Then there are the three on <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, the first where he denounced himself after <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385228PCha class=place long=22.8416 lat=38.4944>Chaeronea</a>, the second in which he pretends that he ought to be punished with death for the affair of <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a>, lastly that in which he advises the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to flee on their triremes at the approach of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, though <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a> had carried a law that anyone who mentioned the war should be put to death. For in these more than any other of the simulated themes that he produced, he has given free reins to the argument, and yet the ideas preserve the effect of presenting both sides. When the doctors were regularly attending him for hardening of the joints, he exhorted them to dig and carve in the stone-quarries of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>. And in writing to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> about this disease he sent this bulletin: I must eat, but I have no hands; I must walk, but I have no feet; I must endure pain, and then I find I have both feet and hands. When he died he was about fifty-six years old, but this age-limit, though for the other learned professions it is the beginning of senility, for a sophist still counts as youthfulness, since in this profession a man's knowledge grows more adaptable with advancing age. <br />He has no tomb in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, though several there are said to be his. For some say that he was buried in the garden of the temple of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>; others, not far from that place near the sea, and there is a small temple thereabouts with a statue of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> in it, arrayed as he was when he performed the sacred rites on the trireme, and beneath his statue they say that the man himself lies; while others say that he was buried in the courtyard of his house under the bronze statues. But none of these accounts is true, for if he had died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> there is not one of the marvellous temples in that city in which he would have been deemed unworthy to lie. But yet another version is nearer the truth, namely that he lies at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> near the Syrian gate, where, in fact, are the sepulchres of his ancestors; that he was buried while still alive, for so he had enjoined on his nearest and dearest; and that, as he lay in the tomb, he thus exhorted those who were shutting up the sepulchre: Make haste, make haste! Never shall the sun behold me reduced to silence! And when his friends wailed over him, he cried with a loud voice: Give me a body and I will declaim! With <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> ended the house of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, for his descendants, though they were his kindred, were not the sort of men who could be compared with his surpassing merit, with the exception of one, of whom I shall speak a little later. </p>                        </div>

And moreover they bring this reproach on <a href=/people/641 target=_blank>Plutus</a> that he is blind; but even if at all other times he appeared to be blind, yet in the case of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> he recovered his sight. For he had eyes for his friends, he had eyes for cities, he had eyes for whole nations, since the man watched over them all, and laid up the treasures of his riches in the hearts of those who shared them with him. For indeed he used to say that he who would use his wealth aright ought to give to the needy that they might cease to be in need, and to those that needed it not, lest they should fall into need; and he used to call riches that did not circulate and were tied up by parsimony dead riches and the treasure-chambers in which some men hoard their money prison-houses of wealth; and those who thought they must actually sacrifice to their hoarded money he nicknamed <a href=/people/12244 target=_blank>Aloadae</a>, for they sacrificed to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> after they had imprisoned him. </p>                        </div>

For his grandfather <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> suffered the confiscation of his estate on the charge of aspiring to a tyranny, of which the Emperor was not ignorant, though the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> did not bring it forward. His son <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, however, the father of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, was not overlooked by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> after he had lost his wealth and become poor, but she revealed to him a prodigious treasure in one of the houses which he had acquired near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BDio class=place long=23.7278 lat=37.9703>theatre</a>. And since, on account of its vastness, it made him cautious rather than overjoyed, he wrote the following letter to the Emperor: O Emperor, I have found a treasure in my own house. What commands do you give about it? To which the Emperor (<a href=/people/1075 target=_blank>Nerva</a> at that time was on the throne) replied: Use what you have found. But <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> did not abandon his caution and wrote that the extent of the treasure was beyond his station. Then misuse your windfall, replied the Emperor, for yours it is. Hence <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> became powerful, but <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> still more so, for besides his father's fortune his mother's also, which was not much less, helped to make him affluent. This same <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> was also distinguished for his lordly spirit. As an instance, at a time when <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was governor of the free cities in Asia, he observed that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was ill-supplied with baths, and that the inhabitants drew muddy water from their wells, and had to dig cisterns to catch rain water. Accordingly he wrote to the Emperor <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> to ask him not to allow an ancient city, conveniently near the sea, to perish from drought, but to give them three million drachmae to procure a water-supply, since he had already bestowed on mere villages many times that sum. The Emperor approved of the advice in the letter as in accordance with his own disposition, and appointed <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> himself to take charge of the water-supply. But when the outlay had reached the sum of seven million drachmae, and the officials who governed Asia kept writing to the Emperor that it was a scandal that the tribute received from five hundred cities should be spent on the fountain of one city, the Emperor expressed his disapproval of this to <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, whereupon <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> replied in the most lordly fashion in the world: Do not, O Emperor, allow yourself to be irritated on account of so trifling a sum. For the amount spent in excess of the three millions I hereby present to my son, and my son will present it to the town. His will, moreover, in which he bequeathed to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> a mina annually for every citizen, proclaims the magnificence of the man; and he practised it in other ways also. He would often sacrifice a hundred <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> to the goddess in a single day, and entertain at the sacrificial feast the whole population of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> by tribes and families.

The terms of the will were as I have stated, and <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> drew it up by the advice of his freedmen, who since they saw that <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was by nature prone to deal harshly with his freedmen and slaves, tried in this way to prepare a haven for themselves among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, by appearing responsible for the legacy. What sort of relation existed between the freedmen and <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> may be plainly seen in the invective which he composed against them. For in it he shot forth at them every weapon that his tongue could command. When the will had been read, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> made a compact with <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> that by paying them each five minae down he should redeem his obligation to keep up continued payments. But when they came to the banks to get the sum that had been agreed upon, then and there they had to listen to the recital of contracts made by their fathers and grandfathers, showing that they were in debt to the parents of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, and they were held liable for counter-payments, with the result that some received payment of only a small sum, others nothing at all, while some were detained in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a> as debtors who must pay. This treatment exasperated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, who felt they had been robbed of their legacy, and they never ceased to hate <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, not even at the time when he thought he was conferring on them the greatest benefits. Hence they declared the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPan class=place long=23.7404 lat=37.969>Panathenaic stadium</a> was well named, since he had built it with money of which all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were being deprived.

Further he colonized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403195UOri class=place long=19.4297 lat=40.319>Oricum</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, which by this time had fallen into decay, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and made it habitable by giving it a water-supply, since it was greatly in need of this. And he endowed the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=place long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboea</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> with various gifts. And yet, though he had achieved such great works, he held that he had done nothing important because he had not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230ACoC class=place long=22.9686 lat=37.94528>cut</a> through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a>. For he regarded it as a really brilliant achievement to cut away the mainland to join two seas, and to contract lengths of sea into a voyage of twenty-six stades. This then he longed to do, but he never had the courage to ask the Emperor to grant him permission, lest he should be accused of grasping at an ambitious plan to which not even <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> had proved himself equal. But in conversation he did let out that ambition in the following way. For as I have been told by <a href=/people/4948 target=_blank>Ctesidemus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was driving to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> with <a href=/people/4948 target=_blank>Ctesidemus</a> sitting by his side, and when he arrived at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> cried: <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, I aspire to do it, but no one will let me! <a href=/people/4948 target=_blank>Ctesidemus</a> was surprised at what he had said and asked him why he had made the remark. Whereupon <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> replied: For a long time I have been striving to bequeath to men that come after me some proof of an ambition that reveals me for the man I am, and I consider that I have not yet attained to this reputation. Then <a href=/people/4948 target=_blank>Ctesidemus</a> recited praises of his speeches and his deeds which no other man could surpass. But <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> replied: All this that you speak of must decay and yield to the hand of time, and others will plunder my speeches and criticize now this, now that. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230ACoC class=place long=22.9686 lat=37.94528>cutting</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> is a deathless achievement and more than one would credit to human powers, for in my opinion to cleave through the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230LIst class=place long=22.973 lat=37.928>Isthmus</a> calls for <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> rather than a mere man. <br />As to the being whom most men used to call the <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, this was a youth in early manhood, as tall as a tall <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=person long=7 lat=49>Celt</a>, and in fact about eight feet high. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> describes him in one of his letters to <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a>. He says that his hair grew evenly on his head, his eyebrows were bushy and they met as though they were but one, and his eyes gave out a brilliant gleam which betrayed his impulsive temperament; he was hook-nosed, and had a solidly built neck, which was due rather to work than to diet. His chest, too, was well formed and beautifully slim, and his legs were slightly bowed outwards, which made it easy for him to stand firmly planted. He was draped in <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>-skins sewed together to make a garment, and he used to contend against wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, jackals, <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, and mad <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, and would exhibit the scars from these combats. Some say that this <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> was earth-born and sprang from the folk in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, but <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> says that he heard him say that his mother was a woman so strong that she herded <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and his father was <a href=/people/4758 target=_blank>Marathon</a> whose statue is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381240DMar class=place long=23.9701 lat=38.1466>Marathon</a>, and he is a rustic hero. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> asked this <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> whether he also was immortal. To which he replied: I am only longer lived than a mortal. Then he asked him what he lived on, and he said: I live chiefly on milk, and am fed by <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and herds of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> and brood mares, and the she-ass also provides a sweet sort of milk and light to digest. But when I meet with barley meal, I eat ten quarts, and the farmers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381240DMar class=place long=23.9701 lat=38.1466>Marathon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> supply me with this feast; they also nickname me <a href=/people/6180 target=_blank>Agathion</a>, because they think that I bring them luck. And what about your speech? asked <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. How were you educated, and by whom? For you do not seem to be an uneducated man. The interior of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> educated me <a href=/people/6180 target=_blank>Agathion</a> replied, a good school for a man who wishes to be able to converse. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> in the city admit as hirelings youths who come in like a flood from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=person long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> and from other barbarian peoples, and their own speech deteriorates from the influence of these barbarians to a greater extent than they can contribute to the improvement of the speech of the newcomers. But the central district is untainted by barbarians, and hence its language remains uncorrupted and its dialect sounds the purest strain of <a href=/people/940 target=_blank>Atthis</a>. Were you ever at a public festival? inquired <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. Yes, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pytho</a>, replied <a href=/people/6180 target=_blank>Agathion</a>, but I did not mingle with the crowd, but from the summit of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a> I listened to the musical competitions when <a href=/people/1594 target=_blank>Pammenes</a> won applause in tragedy, and it seemed to me that the wise Greeks were doing an immoral thing when they listened with delight to the criminal deeds of the houses of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> and <a href=/people/1646 target=_blank>Labdacus</a>; for when myths are not discredited they may be the counsellors of evil deeds. When <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> saw that he had a philosophic bent, he asked him also what was his opinion about the gymnastic contests, and he replied: Even more do I laugh at them when I see men struggling with one another in the pancratium, and boxing, running, wrestling, and winning crowns for all this. Let the athlete who is a runner receive a crown for running faster than a deer or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and let him who trains for a weightier contest be crowned for wrestling with a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> or bear, a thing which I do every day; for fortune has robbed me of a really great encounter, now that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka class=place long=21 lat=38.8>Acarnania</a> no longer breeds <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>. On this <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> admired him greatly and begged him to dine with him. Tomorrow, replied <a href=/people/6180 target=_blank>Agathion</a>, I will come to you at noon at the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/313300UCan class=place long=30.0772 lat=31.3107>Canobus</a>, and do you have there the largest bowl that is in the temple full of milk that has not been milked by a woman. Accordingly he came next day at the time agreed upon, but when he had raised the bowl to his nose, he said: The milk is not pure, for the odour of a woman's hand assails my senses. When he had said this he went away without tasting the milk. Then <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> gave heed to what he had said about the woman, and sent to the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-sheds to find out the truth; and on hearing that thus the matter actually stood, he recognized that there was a superhuman character about the man. </p>                        </div>

For though they did in a manner shove one another aside, as happens in a rough place and a narrow road, still they did not break the law by coming to blows, and indeed <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a> would not have neglected to describe the incident in his suit against <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, when he attacked the man so bitterly that he actually censured those acts of his which are regularly applauded. <br />A charge of murder was also brought against <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, and it was made up in this way. His wife <a href=/people/5224 target=_blank>Regilla</a>, it was said, was in the eighth month of her pregnancy, and <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> ordered his freedman <a href=/people/11006 target=_blank>Alcimedon</a> to beat her for some slight fault, and the woman died in premature childbirth from a blow in the belly. On these grounds, as though true, <a href=/people/5224 target=_blank>Regilla</a>'s brother Braduas brought a suit against him for murder. He was a very illustrious man of consular rank, and the outward sign of his high birth, a crescent-shaped ivory buckle, was attached to his sandal. And when Braduas appeared before the Roman tribunal he brought no convincing proof of the charge that he was making, but delivered a long panegyric on himself dealing with his own family. Whereupon <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> jested at his expense and said: You have your pedigree on your toe-joints. And when his accuser boasted too of his benefactions to one of the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> said with great dignity: I too could have recited many such actions of my own in whatever part of the earth I were now being tried. Two things helped him in his defence. First that he had given orders for no such severe measures against <a href=/people/5224 target=_blank>Regilla</a>; secondly, his extraordinary grief at her death. Even this was regarded as a pretence and made a charge against him, but nevertheless the truth prevailed. For he never would have dedicated to her memory so fine a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BOde class=place long=23.7245 lat=37.9708>theatre</a> nor would he have postponed for her sake the casting of lots for his second consulship, if he had not been innocent of the charge; nor again would he have made an offering of her apparel at the temple of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusis</a>, if he had been polluted by a murder when he brought it, for this was more likely to turn the goddesses into avengers of the murder than to win their pardon. He also altered the appearance of his house in her honour by making the paintings and decorations of the rooms black by means of hangings, dyes, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=demonym long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbian</a> marble, which is a gloomy and dark marble. And they say that Lucius, a wise man, tried to give <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> advice about this, and since he could not persuade him to alter it, he turned him into ridicule. And this incident must not be omitted from my narrative, since it is held worthy of mention by learned writers. For this Lucius ranked among men renowned for learning, and since he had been trained in philosophy by <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, his repartees were apt to hit the mark, and he practised a wit well suited to the occasion. Now, as he was very intimate with <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, he was with him when he was most deeply afflicted by his grief, and used to give him good advice to the following effect: <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, in every matter that which is enough is limited by the golden mean, and I have often heard <a href=/people/1297 target=_blank>Musonius</a> argue on this theme, and have often discoursed on it myself; and, moreover, I used to hear you also, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>, commending the golden mean to the Greeks, and at that time you would even exhort rivers to keep their course in mid channel between their banks. But what has now become of all this advice? For you have lost your self-control, and are acting in a way that we must needs deplore, since you risk your great reputation. He said more to the same effect. But since he could not convince him, he went away in anger. And he saw some slaves at a well that was in the house, washing radishes, and asked them for whose dinner they were intended. They replied that they were preparing them for <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. At this Lucius remarked: <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> insults <a href=/people/5224 target=_blank>Regilla</a> by eating white radishes in a black house. This speech was reported indoors to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, and when he heard it he removed the signs of mourning from his house, for fear he should become the laughingstock of wise men. </p>                        </div>

The Emperor Marcus was greatly interested in Sextus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=person long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a> philosopher, attending his classes and going to his very door. Lucius had just arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and asked the Emperor, whom he met going out, where he was going and for what purpose. Marcus answered: It is a good thing even for one who is growing old to acquire knowledge. I am going to Sextus the philosopher to learn what I do not yet know. At this Lucius raised his hand to heaven, and exclaimed: O <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>! The Emperor of the Romans is already growing old, but he hangs a tablet round his neck and goes to school, while my Emperor <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> died at thirty-two! What I have quoted is enough to show the kind of philosophy cultivated by Lucius, for these speeches suffice to reveal the man as a sip reveals the bouquet of wine. <br />Thus, then, his grief for <a href=/people/5224 target=_blank>Regilla</a> was quenched, while his grief for his daughter Panathenais was mitigated by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, who buried her in the city, and decreed that the day on which she died should be taken out of the year. But when his other daughter, whom he called <a href=/people/2160 target=_blank>Elpinice</a>, died also, he lay on the floor, beating the earth and crying aloud: O my daughter, what offerings shall I consecrate to thee? What shall I bury with thee? Then Sextus the philosopher who chanced to be present said: No small gift will you give your daughter if you control your grief for her. He mourned his daughters with this excessive grief because he was offended with his son <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>. He had been misrepresented to him as foolish, bad at his letters, and of a dull memory. At any rate, when he could not master his alphabet, the idea occurred to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> to bring up with him twenty-four boys of the same age named after the letters of the alphabet, so that he would be obliged to learn his letters at the same time as the names of the boys. He saw too that he was a drunkard and given to senseless amours, and hence in his lifetime he used to utter a prophecy over his own house, adapting a famous verse as follows: One fool methinks is still left in the wide house, and when he died he handed over to him his mother's estate, but transferred his own patrimony to other heirs. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, however, thought this inhuman, and they did not take into consideration his foster-sons <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Polydeuces</a>, and <a href=/people/440 target=_blank>Memnon</a>, and that he mourned them as though they had been his own children, since they were highly honourable youths, noble-minded and fond of study, a credit to their upbringing in his house. Accordingly he put up statues of them hunting, having hunted, and about to hunt, some in his shrubberies, others in the fields, others by springs or in the shade of plane-trees, not hidden away, but inscribed with execrations on any one who should pull down or move them. Nor would he have exalted them thus, had he not known them to be worthy of his praises. And when the <a href=/people/5219 target=_blank>Quintilii</a> during their proconsulship of Greece censured him for putting up the statues of these youths on the ground that they were an extravagance, he retorted: What business is it of yours if I amuse myself with my poor marbles? His quarrel with the <a href=/people/5219 target=_blank>Quintilii</a> began, as most people assert, over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> festival, when they held different views about the musical competition; but some say that it began with the jests that <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> made to Marcus at their expense. For when he saw that, though they were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, the Emperor thought them worthy of the highest honours, he said: I blame <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> also, for loving the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>. But the following reason is nearer the truth. When these two men were both governing Greece, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> invited them to a meeting of the assembly, and made speeches to the effect that they were oppressed by a tyrant, meaning <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>; and finally begged that what they had said might be forwarded to the Emperor's ears. And when the <a href=/people/5219 target=_blank>Quintilii</a> felt pity for the people and without delay reported what they had heard, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> asserted that they were plotting against him, for they were inciting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to attack him. Certainly, after that meeting of the assembly there sprang into activity men like <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a>, <a href=/people/2925 target=_blank>Praxagoras</a> and <a href=/people/3420 target=_blank>Mamertinus</a>, and many others whose public policy was opposed to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. Thereupon <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> indicted them on the charge of a conspiracy to set the people against him, and tried to bring them before the proconsular court. But they escaped secretly and went to the Emperor Marcus, relying both on the Emperor's disposition, which was somewhat democratic, and also on the favourable moment. For the Emperor did not acquit <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> of being an accomplice in the treasonable plots of which he had suspected Lucius, after the latter had become his consort in the Empire. Now the Emperor had his head-quarters among the tribes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a> for his base, and <a href=/people/1995 target=_blank>Demostratus</a> and his friends lodged near the Emperor's head-quarters, where Marcus furnished them with supplies, and often asked them whether they needed anything. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> lodged in a suburb in which towers had been erected, some of full height and others half-towers; and there had travelled with him from home two girls, twins just of marriageable age, who were greatly admired for their beauty. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> had brought them up from childhood, and appointed them to be his cupbearers and cooks, and used to call them his little daughters and loved them as though they were. They were the daughters of <a href=/people/11006 target=_blank>Alcimedon</a>, and he was a freedman of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. Now while they were asleep in one of the towers which was very strongly built, a thunderbolt struck them in the night and killed them. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was driven frantic by this misfortune, and when he came before the Emperor's tribunal he was not in his right mind but longed for death. For when he came forward to speak he launched into invectives against the Emperor, and did not even use figures of speech in his oration, though it might have been expected that a man who had been trained in this type of oratory would have had his own anger under control. But with an aggressive and unguarded tongue he persisted in his attack, and cried: This is what I get for showing hospitality to Lucius, though it was you who sent him to me! These are the grounds on which you judge men, and you sacrifice me to the whim of a woman and a three-year-old child! And when Bassaeus, the pretorian prefect, said that he evidently wished to die, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> replied: My good fellow, an old man fears few things! With these words <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> left the court, leaving much of his allowance of water in the clock still to run. But among the eminently philosophic actions of Marcus we must include his behaviour in this trial. For he never frowned or changed his expression, as might have happened even to an umpire, but he turned to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and said: Make your defence, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, even though <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> does not give you leave. And as he listened to the speeches in defence he was greatly pained, though without showing it, by many things that he heard. But when the decree of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> assembly was recited to him, in which they openly attacked <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> for trying to corrupt the magistrates of Greece with the honeyed strains of his eloquence, and when they exclaimed: Alas, what bitter honey! and again, Happy they who perished in the plague! his feelings were so profoundly affected by what he heard that he burst into tears without concealment. But since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> defence contained an indictment not of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> only but also of his freedmen, Marcus turned his anger against the freedmen, employing a punishment which was as mild as possible; for by this phrase he himself describes his judgement. Only in the case of <a href=/people/11006 target=_blank>Alcimedon</a> he remitted the penalty, saying that the loss of his children was enough. Thus did Marcus conduct this affair in a manner worthy of a philosopher. </p>                        </div>

But though <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> did actually live in this place and fell ill there, and offered sacrifices in return for his recovery from sickness, still he was never condemned to exile nor did he suffer this penalty. And as a witness to the truth of this statement I will employ the divine Marcus. For after the affair in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450190RPan class=place long=19 lat=45>Pannonia</a>, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> lived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> in the demes that he loved best, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381240DMar class=place long=23.9701 lat=38.1466>Marathon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381238DKep class=place long=23.8206 lat=38.0851>Cephisia</a>. And youths from all parts of the world hung on his lips, and they flocked to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in their desire to hear his eloquence. But he put it to the test whether the Emperor was offended with him on account of what had happened in the court, by sending him a letter which so far from being an apology was a complaint. For he said that he wondered why the Emperor no longer wrote to him, though in former times he had written to him so often that three letter-carriers had once arrived at his house in a single day, treading in one another's footsteps. Thereupon the Emperor wrote to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> at some length and on several subjects, tempering what he wrote with an admirable urbanity, and from this letter I will extract all that bears on my present narrative, and publish it. The letter began with these words: I greet you, friend <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>! Then after discussing the military winter quarters where he was at the time, and lamenting his wife of whom he had recently been bereaved by death, and after some remarks on his own bad health, he continued the letter as follows: For yourself I wish you good health, and that you should think of me as well disposed to you. And do not regard yourself as unjustly treated, if after I detected the crimes of some of your household chastised them with a punishment as mild as possible. Do not, I say, feel resentment against me on this account, but if I have annoyed you in aught, or am still annoying you, demand reparation from me in the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> in your city at the time of the Mysteries. For I made a vow, when the war began to blaze highest, that I too would be initiated, and I could wish that you yourself should initiate me into those rites. Such was the apology of Marcus, so benignant and so firm. Who would ever have addressed in these terms one whom he had cast into exile, or who would have imposed exile on one whom he held worthy to be so addressed? Moreover, the story is told that when <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> the governor of the Eastern provinces was plotting treason against Marcus, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> rebuked him in a letter that ran thus: <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> to <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. You have gone mad. We must regard this letter as not merely a rebuke but also as a strong demonstration by one who, to defend the Emperor, took up the weapons of the intelligence. </p>                        </div>

In regard to its style, its characterization is even throughout, for the impressive manner is sustained from the opening sentences to the end of the speech. But the formal modes of expression are manifold and never alike, but are worthy of all praise. I grant that the speech has become famous among the malicious partly on account of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, because it attacked one so distinguished. But how stoutly <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> bore himself in the face of abuse will appear also from what he once said to the <a href=/people/11089 target=_blank>Cynic</a> <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. For this <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> was one of those who have the courage of their philosophy, so much so that he threw himself into a bonfire at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=place long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympia</a>; and he used to <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> the steps of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> and insult him in a semi-barbarous dialect. So once <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> turned round and said: You speak ill of me, so be it, but why in such bad Greek? And when <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> became still more persistent with his accusations, he said: We two have grown old, you in speaking ill of me and I in hearing you. By which he implied that, though he heard him, he laughed him to scorn, because he was convinced that false accusations reach the ears but wound no deeper. will describe also the eloquence of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> and proceed to the main characteristics of his oratory. <br />I have already said that he counted <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a>, <a href=/people/278 target=_blank>Favorinus</a>, and <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a> among his teachers, that he attended the lectures of <a href=/people/1174 target=_blank>Secundus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, but for the critical branch of oratory he studied with <a href=/people/145 target=_blank>Theagenes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidos</a> and <a href=/people/3050 target=_blank>Munatius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=person long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Tralles</a>; and for the doctrines of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, with <a href=/people/10933 target=_blank>Taurus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>. The structure of his work was suitably restrained, and its strength lay in subtlety rather than in vigour of attack. He was impressive in the plain style, sonorous after the manner of <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a>; his ideas were such as would not occur to the mind of another; he had an easy and urbane wit which was not dragged in, but inspired by the subjects themselves; his diction was pleasing and abounded in figures and had grace and beauty; he was skilful in varying his constructions; his tone was not vehement but smooth and steady, and, speaking generally, his type of eloquence is like gold dust shining beneath the waters of a silvery eddying river. For while he devoted himself to the study of all the older writers, from <a href=/people/425 target=_blank>Critias</a> he was inseparable, and he made the Greeks better acquainted with him, since he had hitherto been neglected and overlooked. And when all Greece was loud in applause of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> and called him one of the Ten, he was not abashed by such a compliment, though it seems magnificent enough, but replied to his admirers with great urbanity: Well at any rate I am better than <a href=/people/998 target=_blank>Andocides</a>. Though no man ever learned more easily than he, he did not neglect hard work, but used to study even while he drank his wine, and at night in his wakeful intervals. Hence the lazy and light-minded used to call him the Stuffed Orator. </p>                        </div>

This man was a pupil of <a href=/people/3622 target=_blank>Lollianus</a>, but he had also attended the lectures of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>. He lived to be over fifty, held the chair for two years, and both in the forensic and purely sophistic branches of oratory the style of his speeches was sufficiently good. </p>                        </div>

This man belonged to a family of consular rank, and though from boyhood to early manhood he had devoted himself to the teachings of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> school, he went over entirely to the sophists, and at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> regularly attended the lectures of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> on extempore oratory. Now, so long as he was a student of philosophy he was slovenly in appearance, unkempt and squalid in his dress, but now he began to be fastidious, discarded his slovenly ways, and admitted into his house all the pleasures that are afforded by the lyre, the flute, and the singing voice, as though they had come begging to his doors. For though hitherto he had lived with such austerity he now began to be immoderate in his attendance at theatres and their loud racket. When he was beginning to be famous at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a>, and all the Hellenes in that region hung on his oratory, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> travelled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391272PPer class=place long=27.1842 lat=39.1325>Pergamon</a> and sent all his own pupils to hear him, thereby exalting the reputation of <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a> as though <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> herself had cast her vote. His style of eloquence was lucid and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a>, but it was more suited to formal discourse than to forensic argument, for his language is without acrimony or impulsive outbreaks on the spur of the moment. And even his Atticism, tested by comparison with the language of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, will seem over-subtle and deficient in the qualities of magnificence and sonorousness. <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a> died when his hair was streaked with grey, on the very threshold of old age. </p>                        </div>

No doubt that was because he knew that he had a bitter and violent temper, and that he could not control it.

He had no talent for formal discourse, and since he was the shrewdest of men he used to run down this branch of the art as childish, so that he might appear to despise it rather than to be unequal to it. But in declamation he won great fame, for he had a sure touch in simulated arguments, was energetic in accusation and invective, brilliant in defence, strong in characterization, and, in a word, his style of eloquence was somewhat too sophistic for the forensic branch and more forensic than sophistic usually is. He handled the emotions more skilfully than any other sophist, for he did not spin out long monodies or abject lamentations, but expressed them in a few words and adorned them with ideas better than I can describe, as is evident in other cases that he pleaded, but especially in the following. A girl has been ravished, and has chosen that her ravisher shall be put to death l; later a child is born of this rape, and the grandfathers dispute as to which one of them shall bring up the child. <a href=/people/12139 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was pleading on behalf of its paternal grandfather, and exclaimed: Give up the child! Give it up this instant before it can taste its mother's milk! The other theme is as follows. A tyrant abdicates on condition of immunity for himself. He is slain by one whom he has caused to be made a eunuch, and the latter is on his defence for the murder. In this case <a href=/people/12139 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> refuted the strongest point made by the prosecution when they quoted the compact between the people and the tyrant; and threw in an ingenious argument while he set forth the eunuch's personal grievance: With whom, pray, cried he, did he make this agreement? With children, weak women, boys, old men, and men. But there is no description of me in that contract. Most skilful, too, was his defence of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=ethnic long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Cretans</a>, standing their trial in the matter of the tomb of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; when he made brilliant use of arguments drawn from natural philosophy and all that is taught concerning the gods. He delivered extempore declamations, but he also took pains with written compositions, as others of his works make evident, but above all, his History. For in this he has displayed to the full both his powers of language and of thought, and, moreover, he devotes himself to the love of the beautiful. Concerning the end of <a href=/people/12139 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, some say that he died at the age of seventy, others that he was not so old; again, some say that he died at home, others abroad. </p>                        </div>

After pausing for a brief space he sprang from his seat with a look of gladness on his face, like one who brings good news to those who shall listen to what he has to tell them. While his speech was proceeding, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> made his appearance, wearing a shady <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> hat as was the fashion in the summer season at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, but perhaps also to show <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> that he had just arrived from a journey. Thereupon <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> adapted his speech so as to take note of the famous man's presence in impressive and sonorous language; and he put it to him whether he would prefer to listen to the argument that was already being discussed or to propose another himself. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> glanced towards the audience, saying that he would do whatever they decided, and they unanimously agreed that they would hear The Scythians; for indeed <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was making out his case with brilliant success, as the anecdote shows. But he made a further wonderful display of his marvellous powers in what now took place. For the sentiments that he had so brilliantly expressed before <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> came he now recast in his presence, but with such different words and different rhythms, that those who were hearing them for the second time could not feel that he was repeating himself. For example, before <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> appeared, the epigram that won the greatest applause was this: When it is stagnant, even water goes bad. But after his arrival he gave it a different force, by saying: Even those waters are sweeter that keep on the move. Here are some more quotations from The Scythians of <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a> froze I would travel South, but when it thawed I would go North, always in perfect health, not as I am now, an invalid. For what harm can come to a man who follows the seasons in their course? In the last part of his speech he denounced the city as a cramped and suffocating dwelling, and for the closing sentence he cried out very loud: Come fling open the gates, I must breathe the air! Then he hastened up to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, embraced him and said: Pray regale me in return. Why not indeed, said <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, when you have regaled me so splendidly? When the declamation was over, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> called together the more advanced of his own pupils and asked them what was their opinion of the sophist; and when <a href=/people/10245 target=_blank>Sceptus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=person long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a> said that he had found the clay but had still to find the <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> cut him short, and said: Do not talk like that to anyone else, for, said he, you will incriminate yourself as an illiterate critic. Nay rather follow me in thinking him a more sober <a href=/people/1849 target=_blank>Scopelian</a>. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> thus characterized him because he had observed that the sophist knew how to combine a sober and tempered eloquence with a bold use of sophistic modes of thought; and when he himself declaimed before <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> he raised his eloquence to a higher pitch, because he knew that <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> took the keenest pleasure in intensity and force; and he introduced into his speech rhythms more varied than those of the flute and the lyre, because he considered that <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was especially skilful in elaborate variations. The theme elected by his audience was, The wounded in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> implore the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> who are retreating thence to put them to death with their own hands. In the course of this argument, with tears in his eyes, he uttered that famous and often quoted supplication: Ah, <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a>! Ah, my father!

And that <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was delighted beyond measure by this eulogy, and yielding to his innate generosity presented him with ten pack animals, ten <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, ten cup-bearers, ten shorthand writers, twenty talents of gold, a great quantity of silver, and two lisping children from the deme <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKll class=person long=23.726 lat=37.967>Collytus</a>, since he was told that <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> liked to hear childish voices.

For among the Greeks he has never yet attained to the full measure of the renown that is his due. The following quotations from his discourses show how sublime and at the same time how delightful was his style of eloquence. <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> was in love with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> with fluteplaying. And again: Arabia is a land of abundant woods, well-shaded plains, there is no barren spot, her soil is all plants and flowers. Not a leaf that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> grows would one ever throw aside, no stem or stalk that grew there would one ever cast away; so happy is her soil in all that exudes therefrom. And again: I am a poor man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=person long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>, yet <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> consists of pure Hellenes who colonized the land of the barbarians. <a href=/people/12139 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> made fun of this style, and despised <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for indulging too much in the luxury of fine-sounding words; and so when he came before the public at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> he began his speech with the words: Ionias, Lydias, Marsyases, foolishness, propose me themes. </p>                        </div>

For instance, when his theme was this: <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> urges that they should keep up the war, even after the oracle in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god declared that, whether summoned to their aid or not summoned, he would be the ally of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, he withstood the oracle with these words: But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> god, you say, promises to aid the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>. He is deceiving them. Even so did he promise them <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>. And again, when representing the man who advised <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> to throw a bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>, he said: Let the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a> of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> flow beneath your feet, and if he gives your army a smooth crossing do him the honour of drinking of his waters. Again, when he sustained the part of <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a> trying to dissuade <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> from making a second expedition against Greece, he summed up the argument as follows: Now the condition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> is as I have said, O King, if you stay where you are. But the soil of the Greeks is poor, their sea is narrow, their men are foolhardy, their gods are jealous gods. When he was trying to persuade those who had bad health in the plains to migrate to the mountains, he thus discoursed on nature: I believe the Creator of the universe hurled down the plains as being of less precious material, and raised up the mountains as worthy of regard. These the sun greets first and abandons last. Who would not love a place where the days are longer than elsewhere?  </p>                        </div>

His teacher was Quadratus the consul, who used to argue extempore on abstract philosophical themes, and as a sophist followed the fashion set by <a href=/people/278 target=_blank>Favorinus</a>. <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> was commonly nicknamed the stork, because of the fiery hue and beaked shape of his nose, and that this witticism was not far-fetched we may gather from the likenesses of him which are dedicated in the temple of the goddess of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370309PPer class=place long=30.856 lat=36.961>Perge</a>.

But when <a href=/people/970 target=_blank>Hermogenes</a> arrived at manhood his powers suddenly deserted him, though this was not due to any apparent disease, and this provided the envious with an occasion for their wit.

The following will show the kind of eloquence that he affected. In a speech that he was delivering before Marcus, he said, You see before you, Emperor, an orator who still needs an attendant to take him to school, an orator who still looks to come of age. He said much more of this sort and in the same facetious vein.

For instance it is said that when someone in his audience began to go to sleep, he gave him a blow in the face with his open hand. After making a brilliant start in his career while still a mere boy, he did not fall short of it even when he began to grow old, but made such progress that he was regarded as the model of what a teacher should be.

For he was walking towards evening in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XKer class=place long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Cerameicus</a> with four men of the sort that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> chase after the sophists, and saw a young man on his right, with several others, keep turning round, and imagining that he was making some jest at his expense he called out: Well, and who may you be?

In <a href=/people/1484 target=_blank>Philagrus</a>, was the answer. Now this foolish brawl went no further at the time; but on the next day he learned that <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> was living in his suburban villa, and wrote him a letter accusing him of neglecting to teach his pupils decent manners. </p>                        </div>

Not thus is it with this mighty fire. For it seems to me that, like the poet, he assigns his portion to each, saying: To thee I give the North and to thee the South, to thee the evening, but in the darkness of night are ye all, yea all, when I am invisible; Then the sun rises leaving the fair waters of the sea, and the stars are nowhere. The rhythms that he used in his declamations may be seen in his speech The Uninvited; and indeed he is said to have delighted in such rhythms: Friend, today I have seen thee as thou art, today thou speakest to me in arms and sword in hand. And again: The only friendship that I recognize springs from the assembly of the people. Therefore depart, friends, since for you we preserve this title, and if ever we need allies, we will send for you; if ever, that is to say! In height <a href=/people/1484 target=_blank>Philagrus</a> was below the average, his brow was stern, his eye alert and easily roused to anger, and he was himself conscious of his morose temper. Hence when one of his friends asked him why he did not enjoy bringing up a family, he replied: Because I do not even enjoy myself. Some say that he died at sea, others in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> when he was on the eve of old age. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> had, as it happened, met Marcus once at an earlier time in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>.

But they said that they too had not seen him, for otherwise they would not have failed to present him; and next day they both arrived to escort <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> in state. The Emperor addressed him, and inquired: Why did we have to wait so long to see you? To which <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> replied: A subject on which I was meditating kept me busy, and when the mind is absorbed in meditation it must not be distracted from the object of its search. The Emperor was greatly pleased with the man's personality, so unaffected was it and so devoted to study, and he asked: When shall I hear you declaim?  Propose the theme today, he replied, and tomorrow come and hear me, for I am one of those who do not vomit their speeches but try to make them perfect. Permit my students also, O Emperor, to be in the audience. They have my permission, said Marcus, for that is democratic. And when <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> added: and give them leave, O Emperor, to shout and applaud as loud as they can the Emperor smiled and retorted: That rests with you. I have not given the theme of this declamation, because the accounts of its title vary, but in this at least all agree, that <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> in speaking before Marcus employed an admirable impetuosity of speech, and that far ahead fate was preparing for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> to be rebuilt through the efforts of this gifted man. And when I say this I do not imply that the Emperor would not of his own accord have restored the ruined city which he had admired when it was still flourishing, but I say it because even dispositions that are truly royal and above the ordinary, when incited by good advice and by eloquence, shine out more brightly and press on with ardour to noble deeds. </p>                        </div>

They also criticize a proverbial phrase of his, on the ground that he had thrown it in casually with an effect of vulgarity. I mean that, when attacking <a href=/people/12138 target=_blank>Alexander</a> for merely imitating his father's energy in affairs, he said: He is a chip off the old block. These same critics also condemn a jest of his when he said that the one-eyed <a href=/people/11015 target=_blank>Arimaspi</a> were <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s kinsmen. And yet even <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> defended his policy to the Greeks against one whom he called the tragic ape and the rustic <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a>. But do not judge of <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> from these extracts, but rather estimate his powers in such speeches as <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> tries to wean the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from their empire of the sea; or The speaker upbraids <a href=/people/3790 target=_blank>Callixenus</a> for not having granted burial to the Ten; or The deliberations on the state of affairs in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; or <a href=/people/96 target=_blank>Aeschines</a>, when he had not received the corn from <a href=/people/704 target=_blank>Cersobleptes</a>; or They reject the treaty of alliance after their children have been murdered. It is in this last argument above all that he teaches us how, without making any slip, one may handle daring and tragic conceptions. And I know several other arguments of his that demonstrate the man's erudition, force and power of characterization, and it is by these that he ought to be estimated rather than by passages in which he has drivelled somewhat and has fallen into affectation. Moreover, <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> was of all the sophists most deeply versed in his art, and his strength lay in the elaborate cogitation of a theme; for which reason he refrained from extempore speaking. For the desire not to produce anything except after long cogitation keeps the mind too busy and robs it of alertness. Some writers record that <a href=/people/797 target=_blank>Aristeides</a> died at home, others say that it was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>; again some say that he reached the age of sixty, others that he was nearly seventy. </p>                        </div>

For, as I used to hear from my own teachers, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in the time of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> and there displayed a great natural talent for sophistic, and it was generally held that he would rise to greatness in his profession. For he began to attend the school of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> when he was perhaps eighteen years old, was very soon admitted to the same privileges as <a href=/people/10245 target=_blank>Sceptus</a> and <a href=/people/4406 target=_blank>Amphicles</a>, and was enrolled among the pupils belonging to the <a href=/people/7522 target=_blank>Clepsydrion</a>. Now the <a href=/people/7522 target=_blank>Clepsydrion</a> was conducted in the following manner. After the general lecture which was open to all, ten of the pupils of <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, that is to say those who were proved worthy of a reward for excellence, used to dine for a period limited by a water-clock timed to last through a hundred verses; and these verses <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> used to expound with copious comments, nor would he allow any applause from his hearers, but was wholly intent on what he was saying. And since he had enjoined on his pupils not to be idle even when it was the hour for drinking, but at that time also to pursue some sort of study over their wine, <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> used to drink with the pupils of the clepsydra as their partner in a great and mysterious rite. Now a discussion was once going on about the style of all the sophists, when <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> came forward in their midst, and said: I will now give a sketch of their types of style, not by quoting from memory brief phrases of theirs or smart sayings, or clauses or rhythmical effects. But I will undertake to imitate them, and will reproduce extempore the style of every one of them, with an easy flow of words and giving the rein to my tongue. But in doing this he left out <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, and <a href=/people/4406 target=_blank>Amphicles</a> asked him to explain why he had omitted their own teacher, seeing that he himself was enamoured of his style of eloquence, and saw that they were likewise enamoured. Because, said he, these fellows are the sort that lend themselves to imitation, even when one is drunk. But as for <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, the prince of eloquence, I should be thankful if I could mimic him when I have had no wine and am sober. When this was reported to <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> it gave him the keenest pleasure, naturally, since he never could resist his longing for approbation. When he was still a mere youth <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> invited <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> to hear him make a speech extempore. <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> listened to him, not as some people unjustly accuse him, in an envious or scoffing spirit, but with his usual calm and kindly bearing, and afterwards he encouraged the youth, and ended by saying: These might well be great fragments of a colossus. Thus while he tried to correct his disjointed and ill-constructed style as a fault of youth, he applauded the grandeur both of his words and of his ideas. When <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a> died <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> delivered a funeral oration which did full justice to the man, so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were moved to tears while they listened to his speech. So full of self-confidence was <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> when he ascended the chair of rhetoric at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, that in the prooemium of his address to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> he dilated not on their wisdom but on his own, for he began by announcing: Once again letters have come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>. In fact his prooemium was in the tone of one who breathed on a higher plane than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and bestowed a benefit on them rather than received it.

They went so far as to reverence him just as the tribes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> reverence the initiating priest when he is ceremoniously performing the rites. Then, too, he won them over by giving games and wine-parties and hunts, and by sharing with them the Hellenic festivals; thus adapting himself to their youthfulness and all its varied interests, so that they felt towards him as sons feel towards a father who is amiable and indulgent, and with them keeps up the most boisterous Greek dance. Indeed I myself know that some of them used actually to shed tears when they remembered this sophist, and that some would try to imitate his accent, others his walk, or the elegance of his attire. </p>                        </div>

But the relatives of the dead man charged the sophist with murder in the court of the proconsul of Greece, as being an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> citizen, since both his tribe and his deme were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. He however denied the charge, alleging that neither with his own hands or the hands of any of his slaves had he struck the man who was said to have died. He was assisted in his defence, first by the whole crowd of Hellenes who made every possible plea in his behalf, weeping the while, and secondly by the evidence of the doctor about the wine. Now at the time when the Emperor Marcus travelled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> to be initiated into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Mysteries</a>, this sophists was already in possession of the chair of rhetoric at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and among the things- that Marcus wished to investigate at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> he counted this, that he would inform himself as to the professional skill of <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a>. For he had indeed appointed him to lecture to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> youth without testing him by hearing him lecture, but in acquiescence with the general rumour about him. Now the consul <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> was attacking <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> for putting too much passion and frenzy into his purely sophistic arguments, because his real strength lay in forensic pleading. Therefore Marcus, who wished to put this to the proof, proposed as the theme for declamation <a href=/people/326 target=_blank>Hypereides</a>, when <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386228PEla class=place long=22.783 lat=38.646>Elatea</a>, pays heed only to the counsels of <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>. </p>                        </div>

The Emperor admired him greatly, and exalted him to the skies by grants and gifts. By grants, I mean the right to dine at the expense of the state, a seat of honour at the public games, immunity from taxes, priestly offices, and all else that sheds a lustre on men; and by gifts I mean gold and silver, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, slaves, and all the outward signs of wealth with which he lavishly endowed not only <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a> but his family also, one and all..

And they listened to him as to a sweet- voiced nightingale, struck with admiration of his facile tongue, his well-modulated and flexible voice, and his rhythms, whether in prose or when he sang in recitative.

He was about eighty when he died, and had attained to such high honour that many actually believed him to be a magician. But in my account of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> I have said enough to show that a well-educated man would never be led astray into the practice of magic arts. But I suppose it was because he used to tell marvellous tales in his declamations about the customs of the magicians that he drew down on himself from his hearers this sort of appellation. They slander him too in saying that he had shameless manners because, when one of his pupils sent him a present of fish lying on a silver plate embossed with gold, he was enchanted with the plate and so did not return it, and in acknowledging the present to the sender, he said: It was indeed kind of you to send the fish as well. But it is said that he made this jest as a sarcasm against one of his pupils who had been reported to him as using his wealth in a miserly fashion, and that he gave back the piece of silver after he had castigated the student in this witty manner. This sophist had a copious flow of ideas and handled them brilliantly, and also in the disposition of his themes he showed the utmost variety, which he had acquired from his study of tragedy. He did not observe the conventional arrangement or follow the rules of the art, but he furnished himself with the diction of the ancient sophists and clothed his style therewith as with a garment, with sonorousness rather than striking effects. But in the grand style he often failed, because he employed tragedy with too prodigal a hand. </p>                        </div>

But he came before them in the assembly and broke up the embassy, saying many memorable things in his discourse, and he ended with these words: The ten thousand drachmae do not make a man. He had a weakness for wine, but he kept in check the drunken insolence, levity, and arrogance which wine induces in the minds of men; and his ability to keep sober was so extraordinary that, though his potations went on till cockcrow, he would then attack his studies before he had snatched any sleep. He made himself especially obnoxious to youths of the foolish boasting sort, in spite of the fact that they are more profitable than the rest for the payment of fees.

In his case, then, we must take into account the following facts. <a href=/people/4273 target=_blank>Pollux</a> had been sufficiently well trained in the science of criticism, because he was the pupil of his father, who was an expert in the art of criticism; but he composed his purely sophistic speeches with the aid of audacity rather than art, relying on his natural talents, for he was indeed very highly endowed by nature. He was a pupil of <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a>, and represents the mean between that sophist's excellences and defects. For while he never sinks too low, he never soars, except that rivulets, so to speak, of sweetness permeate his oratory. Here is an example of his style in a discourse: <a href=/people/5355 target=_blank>Proteus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha class=person long=29.8856 lat=31.213>Pharos</a>, that marvel in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, puts on many and manifold shapes, for he rises up into water, blazes into fire, rages into a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, makes a rush into a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, crawls into a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, springs into a panther, and when he turns into a tree, grows leaves for hair. To show the characteristics of his style in declamation, let me quote the theme The islanders who sell their children in order to pay their taxes; for they claim that this is his most successful argument.

For though I might recount even more honours of this sort, they would yet not be worthy of comparison with the man's skill and learning. But rather let his eloquent tongue be his passport to fame, and that keen intelligence which he employed by preference in simulated arguments. For this type of eloquence he was much admired; in the first place because it is a difficult kind of oratory, since in themes that are composed as simulated arguments one needs to put a curb on what one actually says, but to apply the spur to what one leaves unsaid. Then, too I think he was admired because his own natural disposition was taken into account. For though his character was naturally open and without guile, he was clever in portraying characters that were not at all suited to his natural bent. And though he became the wealthiest man in the region of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408280WPro class=place long=28 lat=40.75>Propontis</a>, though he won a great reputation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> for extempore eloquence and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> also, yet he nowhere incurred the enmity of any city or individual, but made money out of his benevolent disposition. It is said of him that he used to harden his body by athletics, that he always followed a rigid diet, and exercised himself like a regular athlete. As a boy he studied with <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, with <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a> when he was a stripling, and he was greatly esteemed by the latter; but he took more pride in <a href=/people/281 target=_blank>Herodes</a>, and used to call him the master, the tongue of the Hellenes, the prince of eloquence, and much more of the same sort. He died at home aged sixty-one years, and left sons about whom I have nothing important to relate, except indeed that they were his offspring. </p>                        </div>

If I shall not be thought too frivolous, we can observe his style in his speech The man who fell in love with a statue. Here is a quotation from it: O living loveliness in a lifeless body, what deity fashioned thee? Was some goddess of <a href=/people/656 target=_blank>Persuasion</a>, or a <a href=/people/1505 target=_blank>Grace</a>, or <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> himself the parent of thy loveliness?

Yea and thou hast a voice ever about to speak. And one day it may be that thou wilt even speak, but I shall be far away. O unloving and unkind! O faithless to thy faithful lover!

Nay for you rather, retorted <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a>, for indeed it also was written on behalf of exemptions. <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> took as the starting-point and basis of his eloquence the style of <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a>, whose pupil he had in fact been. But in spite of this he slips into rhythms that belong to verse, and anapaestic effects; but whenever he avoided these his style has great impressiveness and a stately march. This may be observed in others also of his arguments, but especially in that called <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a> tries to dissuade the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> from burning the dead: Lift the torch on high, man! Why do you do violence to its fire and abase it to the earth and torment it? Fire belongs to the sky, it is ethereal, it tends towards that which is akin to itself. It does not lead the dead down below, but leads the gods up to the skies. Alas, <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>, torch-bearer and fire-bringer, see how thy gift is insulted! It is polluted by the senseless corpse. Come to its help, give it aid, and, if thou canst, even from where thou art steal this fire! I have not quoted this passage in order to excuse him for his licence in the use of rhythms, but to show that he also knew how to use the more sober sort. For the rest he died aged about seventy-five, after a career of great energy as a speaker at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and was buried in the suburbs near the highway that leads to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a>.

So he sailed away secretly, and spent his life in that city. He brought with him a large sum of money, many slaves and other household gear, all splendid and ornate. Even while yet a stripling he was well thought of at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, but after he had attained to manhood he became far more renowned. This was due in the first place to the manner of life that he elected, but also I think it was because of a beneficent act of his, which, though it concerned only one <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> citizen, yet furnished clear proof of a noble and generous disposition. For when he had arrived by ship at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, he inquired of one of the inhabitants of that place whether a certain person still lived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and whether his affairs were going well. Now these inquiries concerned a friend and host of his with whom he had been intimate as a young man at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, at the time, that is, when he was attending the lectures of <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a>. He was told that he still survived and lived there, but that he was on the point of being evicted from his house, and that it was being advertised for sale in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XAgo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.975>Agora</a>, for ten thousand drachmae, for which sum he had mortgaged it. Thereupon, before he himself even went up to the city, he sent the man the sum named, with this message; Free your house, that I may not see you depressed. We are to consider this the act not of a rich man merely, but of one who knew how to use his riches to good purpose, one whom education had made truly humane, and who had an exact understanding of the claims of friendship. </p>                        </div>

He had a son who dissipated his fortune in breeding fighting cocks, quails, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a>, and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, but instead of rebuking him he used to join him in these youthful pursuits. And when many people blamed him for this, he said: He will stop playing with old men sooner than he will with those of his own age. When his son died and then his wife, he became attached to a mistress, since even eyes that are growing old can be captivated, and as she had all the feminine vices he gave her the rein in all matters, and showed himself a very poor guardian of his own estate. <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> laid down the following rules for attendance at his school of declamation. One hundred drachmae paid down gave one the right to attend his lectures at all times. Moreover, he had a library at his own house which was open to his pupils and supplemented the teaching in his lectures. And to prevent us from hissing or jeering at one another, as so often happens in the schools of the sophists, we were summoned to come in all together, and when we had obeyed the summons we sat down, first the boys, then the pedagogues in the middle, and the youths by themselves. It was the rarest thing for him to deliver a formal prooemium, but whenever he did embark on such an address, <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> and <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> were the men whom he resembled. He used to review his declamations on the day before he delivered them in public. Even when he was an old man, aged ninety years, in his powers of memory he surpassed even <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>. The style of his eloquence was natural, but in his abundant use of synonyms he imitated <a href=/people/376 target=_blank>Adrian</a>. </p>                        </div>

This work is a portico a stade in length, all of marble, and the idea of this structure is that the worshippers need not stay away from the temple in case of rain. When this work was completed at great expense, he inscribed it with a dedication to his wife, but the banqueting-hall in the temple he dedicated in his own name, and in size he built it to surpass all that exist elsewhere put together. He decorated it with an elegance beyond words, for it is adorned up by the eleven pupils whose names precede the inscriptionn with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> marble such as had never before been quarried.

For though he was not trained by any sophist of great repute, but was a pupil of <a href=/people/1354 target=_blank>Rufinus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=person long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> who in the sophistic art displayed more audacity than felicity, he easily surpassed all the Greeks of his day in variety, whether of eloquence or invention or arrangement; and it was not that he excelled thus in some kinds of arguments and not in others, but in all, without exception, to which he devoted his attention. For indeed he was very skilful also in handling speeches with simulated arguments, devised many ambiguous expressions, and inserted among his veiled allusions a hint of the true meaning. His grandfather was <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, son of <a href=/people/368 target=_blank>Polemo</a> the sophist, and his father was Rufinianus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=person long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a>, a man of consular rank who had married <a href=/people/1033 target=_blank>Callisto</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>. After his father's death he quarrelled with his own mother so irrevocably that <a href=/people/1033 target=_blank>Callisto</a> did not even shed a tear for him when he died in the flower of his youth, though on such an occasion even to the bitterest enemies it seems piteous to die at that age. One who hears this and only this, will be inclined to impute it to the youth's own evil disposition that not even his mother felt any grief for his loss. But if one takes into account the real reason, and that he ceased to love his mother because of her low passion for a slave, it will appear that the son conformed to the laws, which actually give him the right to put a woman to death for a reason of that sort; whereas the woman deserves to be detested even by those outside the family for the disgrace that she brought upon herself and her son. But while we acquit <a href=/people/675 target=_blank>Hermocrates</a> of this charge, it is not so easy to acquit him of another. For he had inherited from his father a very handsome property, but he squandered it, not on breeding <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, or on public services from which one may win a great reputation, but on strong drink and boon companions of the sort that furnish a theme for Comedy, such a theme, I mean, as was once furnished by the flatterers of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponicus</a>. After <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> had been promoted to be Imperial Secretary he desired to arrange a marriage between <a href=/people/675 target=_blank>Hermocrates</a> and his daughter who was very unattractive in appearance. But <a href=/people/675 target=_blank>Hermocrates</a> did not jump at the chance to share <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s prosperity, but when the woman who was arranging the affair called his attention to the great resources of which <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was then possessed, he replied that he could never become the slave of a large dowry and a father-in-law's swollen pride. And though his relatives tried to push him into this marriage, and regarded <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> as <a href=/people/2558 target=_blank>Corinthus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, he did not give way until the Emperor <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a> summoned him to the East and gave him the girl in marriage. Then, when one of his friends asked him when he was going to celebrate the unveiling of the bride, <a href=/people/675 target=_blank>Hermocrates</a> replied with ready wit: Say rather the veiling, when I am taking a wife like that. And it was not long before he dissolved the marriage, on finding that she had neither a pleasing appearance nor an agreeable disposition. </p>                        </div>

Then, too, the courage of this stripling, when facing a crowded audience, produced in most of his hearers that thrill of admiration which human beings feel for those who achieve great things without intense effort. Moreover his easy flow of words and the striking effects of his voice contributed to his success, and the fact that he could review his themes in the twinkling of an eye, and that what he recited from a manuscript or declaimed was more what one expects from hoary old age than from a mere youth to invent and deliver. There are extant perhaps eight or ten declamations by <a href=/people/675 target=_blank>Hermocrates</a> and a sort of short address which he delivered at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=place long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaea</a> over the Pan-<a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> loving-cup.

But <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> was still more notable as a sophist, because of his great abilities both in invention and oratorical expression; in judicial arguments also he was simple and direct, and in speeches composed for public gatherings he never revelled in a mere frenzy of rhetoric. When he had been turned out of the chair of rhetoric at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in consequence of a conspiracy against him got up by the followers of <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309306UNau class=person long=30.5925 lat=30.8972>Naucratis</a>, in which <a href=/people/3206 target=_blank>Marcianus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372374UDol class=person long=37.3646 lat=37.1547>Doliche</a> was first, middle, and last, he betook himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, which more than any other city sacrificed to the sophistic <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>.

Though in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> it was thought a great thing to have been president at the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> even once, Hippodromus twice presided over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> games, and he outdid his predecessors in wealth and in the elegance with which he ordered the games, and also in the magnanimity and justice which he showed as umpire. At any rate, his conduct in the affair of the tragic actor has left no one else a chance to surpass him in justice and good judgement. The facts are these. <a href=/people/2509 target=_blank>Clemens</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=person long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> was a tragic actor whose like has never yet been seen for artistic skill. But since he was winning his victories at a time when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> was being besieged, he used to be sent away without the reward of victory, lest it should appear that a city that had taken up arms against the Romans was being proclaimed victor in the person of one of her citizens. Accordingly, after he had performed brilliantly in the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyonic</a> games, the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyons</a> were on the point of voting that he should not receive the prize, because for the reason that I have mentioned they were afraid. Whereupon Hippodromus sprang up with great energy and cried: Let these others go on and prosper by breaking their oath and giving unjust decisions, but by my vote I award the victory to <a href=/people/2509 target=_blank>Clemens</a>. And when another of the actors appealed to the Emperor against the award, the vote of Hippodromus was again approved; for at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=demonym long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantine</a> actor carried off the prize. </p>                        </div>

Nevertheless he did not fail to attend regularly the public festivals of Greece, but frequented them partly in order to declaim in public, partly that he might not be forgotten.

For Hippodromus came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> after the death of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> — he had never been there before — and on leaving the ship he went to the market-place in the hope of meeting someone who was proficient in the local style of eloquence. And when he saw a temple with attendants sitting near it, and slaves in waiting carrying loads of books in satchels, he understood that someone of importance was holding his school inside. So he entered, and after greeting <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a>, sat down without making any inquiry. Now <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> thought that he was going to talk to him about pupils, and that he was some father or guardian of boys, and asked him why he had come. You shall learn that, he replied, when we are alone. Accordingly when <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> had finished examining his pupils, he said: Tell me what you want. Let us exchange garments, said Hippodromus. He was in fact wearing a travelling — cloak, while <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> wore a gown suitable for public speaking. And what do you mean by that? asked <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a>. I wish, he replied, to give you a display of declamation. Now <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> really thought that he was mad in making this announcement and that his wits were wandering. But when he observed the keenness of his glance and saw that he seemed sane and sober, he changed clothes with him. When he asked him to suggest a theme, <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> proposed The magician who wished to die because he was unable to kill another magician, an adulterer. And when he took his seat on the lecturer's chair, and after a moment's pause sprang to his feet, the theory that he was mad occurred still more forcibly to <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a>, and he thought that these signs of proficiency were mere delirium. But when he had begun to argue the theme and had come to the words: But myself at least I can kill, <a href=/people/2331 target=_blank>Megistias</a> could not contain himself for admiration, but ran to him and implored to be told who he was. I am, said he, Hippodromus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>, and I have come to practise my art on you in order that I may learn from one man so proficient as you are the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=demonym long=27.3 lat=38>Ionian</a> manner of declaiming.

Thereupon he took up his theme afresh, but gave a wholly different force to the ideas that he had already expressed. And when later on he made his appearance before the public of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, they thought him truly marvellous, and worthy of being enrolled among men of former days. </p>                        </div>

How this came about I must now relate. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405217REor class=ethnic long=21.7 lat=40.5>Heordaean</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> had summoned <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> to perform public services in their city, as was their right in the case of all who on the mother's side were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405217REor class=ethnic long=21.7 lat=40.5>Heordaeans</a>, and since he did not undertake them they referred the matter to the courts. Accordingly the suit came before the Emperor (this was <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> the son of the philosophic <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>); and <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> travelled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to protect his own interests. There he attached himself closely to <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>'s circle of mathematicians and philosophers, and obtained from her with the Emperor's consent the chair of rhetoric at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. But the Emperor, like the gods in <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> who are portrayed as granting favours to one another, but sometimes against their will, nourished the same sort of resentment, and was ill-disposed to <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> because he thought that the latter had stolen a march on him. So when he heard that there was a suit brought against him and that he was to hear it tried, he ordered the official in charge of lawsuits to give notice to <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> that he must make his defence himself and not through another. And when <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> appeared in court he gave offence by his gait, he gave offence by the way in which he stood, his attire seemed far from suitable to the occasion, his voice effeminate, his language indolent and directed to any subject rather than to the matter in hand. All this made the Emperor hostile to <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a>, so that he kept pulling him up throughout the whole speech, both by interjecting his own remarks in the other's allotted time, and by interrupting with abrupt questions. And since the replies of <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> were beside the mark, the Emperor exclaimed: His hair shows what sort of man he is, his voice what sort of orator! And after cutting him short like this many times, he ranged himself on the side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405217REor class=ethnic long=21.7 lat=40.5>Heordaeans</a>. And when <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> said: You have given me exemption from public services by giving me the chair at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, the Emperor cried at the top of his voice: Neither you nor any other teacher is exempt! Never would I, for the sake of a few miserable speeches, rob the cities of men who ought to perform public services. Nevertheless he did, even after this incident, decree for <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=person long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnos</a>, then aged twenty-four, exemption from public service as a reward for a declamation. These then were the reasons why <a href=/people/1007 target=_blank>Philiscus</a> was deprived of the privilege of exemption. </p>                        </div>

But when he had entered he actually looked boldly at the Emperor, asked for time to be allotted to him in which to plead, and then with ready skill delivered his protest, saying: It will seem strange to you, most mighty Emperor, that one should nullify his own suit by pleading it alone, without <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> having your commands to do so. At this the Emperor sprang from his seat and called <a href=/people/1203 target=_blank>Heliodorus</a> a man such as I have never yet known, a new phenomenon such as has appeared only in my own time, and other epithets of this sort, and raising his hand he shook back the fold of his cloak.

But when he bestowed on him the public honour of equestrian rank and also on all his children, men marvelled at the goddess <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> who showed her power by events so incredible.
