But since events subsequent, and scarcely inferior to these, have not hitherto been made the subject of a continuous narrative, I have resolved, though but ill-qualified for such a task, to undertake the labour which the subject demands, and to embody them in a history; surely trusting in Him who enlightened fishermen, and endued a brute tongue with articulate utterance, for ability to raise up transactions already entombed in oblivion, to reanimate them by language, and immortalise them by memory: my object being, that my readers may learn the nature of each of these events, up to our time; the period, place, and manner of its occurrence, as well as those who were its objects and authors; and that no circumstance worthy of recollection, may be lost under the veil of listless indifference, or, its neighbour, forgetfulness. I shall then begin, led onwards by the divine impulse, from the point where the above-mentioned writers closed the history. </p>                        </div>

He fears to assault the faith in open war, embattled by so many holy fathers, and he had been already shorn of nearly all his power in battling against it: but he pursues his purpose with a robber's stealth, by raising certain questions and answers; his new device being to turn the course of error towards Judaism, little foreseeing the overthrow that hence would befall the miserable designer. For the faith which formerly was alone arrayed against him, this he now affects: and, no longer exulting in the thought of forcing us to abandon the whole, but of succeeding in corrupting a single term, while he wound himself with many a malignant wile, he devised the change of merely a letter, tending indeed to the same sense, but still with the intention of severing the thought and the tongue, that both might no longer with one accord offer the same confession and glorification to God. The manner and result of these transactions I will set forth, each at its proper juncture; giving at the same time a place in my narrative to other matters that may occur to me, which, though not belonging to my immediate subject, are worthy of mention, laying up the record of them wherever it shall please our compassionate God. </p>                        </div>

The war of the churches took its rise from the following circumstances. A certain presbyter named <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, a man of corrupt opinions, and a warm admirer of Nestorius and his <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> sentiments, who also accompanied him when setting out from his country to take possession of his bishoprick; at which time Nestorius, having met with <a href=/people/2793 target=_blank>Theodore</a> at Mop-suestia, was perverted by his teaching from godly doctrine, as Theodulus writes in an epistle upon this subject—this <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, in discoursing to the <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>-loving people in the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, dared to say, without any reserve, Let no one style Mary the Mother of God; for Mary was human, and it is impossible for God to be born of a human being. When the <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>-loving people were disgusted, and with reason regarded his discourse as blasphemous, Nestorius, the real teacher of the blasphemy, so far from restraining him and upholding the true doctrine, on the contrary, imparted to the teaching of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> the impulse it acquired, by urging on the question with more than ordinary pugnacity. And further, by mingling with it notions of his own, and thus vomiting forth the venom of his soul, he endeavoured to inculcate opinions still more blasphemous, proceeding so far as thus to avouch, upon his own peril, I could never be induced to call that God which admitted of being two months old or three months old. These circumstances rest on the distinct authority of <a href=/people/10932 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, and the former synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. </p>                        </div>

They accordingly summon Nestorius, with an exhortation that he would defend himself against the allegations.

With these were combined many statements in which holy fathers had purely set forth the true faith, having side by side with them various blasphemies which the frenzy of the impious Nestorius had vented. When all this had been done, the holy synod declared its judgment precisely in the following terms: Since, in addition to the other matters, the most reverend Nestorius has refused to submit to our summons, or yet to admit the most holy and godly bishops who were sent by us, we have of necessity proceeded to the investigation of his impieties: and having convicted him of entertaining and avowing impious sentiments, on the evidence both of his letters and writings which have been read, and also of words uttered by him lately in this metropolitan city, and established by sufficient testimony, at length, compelled by the canons, and in accordance with the epistle of our most holy father and fellow-minister, Celestine, bishop of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, we have, with many tears, proceeded to this sad sentence.

On them the Lord of Hosts himself bestows blessings with a bountiful hand, and grants them victory over their adversaries. <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> He does bestow: for never can he lie who says, As I live, saith the Lord, those that glorify me, I glorify.

And presently he proceeds thus: That the dissension of the church has been altogether unnecessary and without sufficient ground, I am fully convinced, now that my lord the most pious bishop Paul has brought a paper presenting an unexceptionable confession of the faith, and has assured me that it was drawn up by your holiness and the most pious bishops of your country. And such is the writing thus drawn up, and inserted verbatim in the epistle; which, with reference to the Mother of God, speaks as follows: When we read these your sacred words, and were conscious that our own sentiments were correspondent—for there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism—we glorified God, the Preserver of all things, with a feeling of mutual joy, that both your churches and ours maintain a faith in agreement with the divinely inspired Scriptures and the tradition of our holy fathers.

Nestorius, then, himself, the father of the blasphemy, who raised his structure not on the foundation already laid, but built upon the sand one which, in accordance with the Lord's parable, quickly fell to ruin, here, in addition to other matters of his choice, puts forth a defence of his own blasphemy, in reply to those who had charged him with unnecessary innovation and an unseemly demand for the convening of the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. He asserts that he was driven to assume this position by absolute necessity, on account of the division of the church into two parties, one maintaining that Mary ought to be styled Mother of Man; the other, Mother of God; and he devised the title, Mother of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, in order, as he says, that error might not be incurred by adopting either extreme, either a term which too closely united immortal essence with humanity, or one which, while admitting one of the two natures, involved no mention of the other. He also intimates that <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, from feelings of friendship, withheld his ratification of the sentence of deposition; and, afterwards, that, on occasion of the mission of several bishops of both parties from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> to the emperor, and, moreover, at his own request, he was allowed to retire to his own monastery, situated without the gates of the city now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Theopolis</a>. It is not, indeed, expressly named by Nestorius, but is said to be that which is now styled the monastery of Euprepius; which we know to be, in fact, not more than two stadia from that city. Nestorius, then, himself says, that during a residence there of four years, he received every mark of respect and distinction; and that, by a second edict of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, he is banished to the place called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/255307UOas class=place long=30.7305 lat=25.5968>Oasis</a>. But the pith of the matter he has suppressed. For in his retirement he did not cease from his peculiar blasphemy; so that John, the president of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, was led to report the circumstance, and Nestorius was, in consequence, condemned to perpetual banishment. He has addressed also a formal discourse to a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>, on the subject of his banishment to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/255307UOas class=place long=30.7305 lat=25.5968>Oasis</a>, where he treats of these circumstances more fully. But the retribution with which, unable to escape the all-seeing eye, he was visited for his blasphemous imaginations, may be gathered from other writings addressed by him to the governor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebaid</a>: in which one may see how that, since he had not yet reached the full measure of his deserts, the vengeance of God visited him, in pursuance, with the most terrible of all calamities, captivity. Being, then, still deserving of greater penalties, he was liberated by the Blemmyes, into whose hands he had fallen; and, after <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> had decreed his return to his place of exile, wandering from place to place on the verge of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebaid</a>, </p>                        </div>

In order that I may not incur a charge of slander, let me bring Nestorius himself into court as an evidence on these points.

And presently he proceeds thus: Inasmuch as the beforementioned place has fallen into the hands of the barbarians, and been reduced to utter desolation by fire and sword, and I, by a most unexpected act of compassion, have been liberated by them, with a menacing injunction instantly to fly from the spot, since the Mazices were upon the point of succeeding them in their occupation of it; I have, accordingly, reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebaid</a>, together with the captive survivors whom they had joined with me, by an act of pity for which I am unable to account.

Therefore I entreat your highness to take that just view of my seizure which the laws would enjoin, and not sacrifice a prisoner of war to the malice and evil designs of men: lest there should hence arise this melancholy story with all posterity, that it is better to be made captive by barbarians, than to fly for refuge to the protection of the Roman sovereignty. He then prefers, with solemn adjuration, the following request: I request you to lay before the emperor the circumstance, that my arrival hither from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/255307UOas class=place long=30.7305 lat=25.5968>Oasis</a> arose from my liberation by the barbarians; so that my final disposal, according to God's good pleasure, may now be determined.

For while we are endeavouring to trace the unutterable and unsearchable scheme of God's mercy to man, and to revere and exalt it to the utmost, our opinions are swayed in this or that direction: and with none of those who have been the authors of heresies among <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, was blasphemy the first intention; nor did they fall from the truth in a desire to dishonour the Deity, but rather from an idea which each entertained, that he should improve upon his predecessors by upholding such and such doctrines. Besides, all parties agree in a confession which embraces the essential points; for a Trinity is the single object of our worship, and unity the complex one of our glorification, and the Word, who is God begotten before the worlds, and became flesh by a second birth in mercy to the creature: and if new opinions have been broached on other points, these also have arisen from the freedom granted to our will by our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> God, even on these subjects, in order that the holy catholic and apostolic church might be the more exercised in bringing opposing opinions into captivity to truth and piety, and arrive, at length, at one smooth and straight path. Accordingly the apostle says most distinctly: There is need of heresies among you, that the approved ones may be manifested. And here also, we have occasion to admire the unutterable wisdom of God, who said to the divine Paul, My strength is made perfect in weakness. For by the very causes by which the members of the church have been broken off, the true and pure doctrine has been more accurately established, and the catholic and apostolic church of God has attained amplification and exaltation to heaven. But those who have been nurtured in Grecian error, having no desire to extol God or his tender care of men, were continually endeavouring to shake the opinions of their predecessors, and of each other, rather devising gods upon gods, and assigning to them by express titles the tutelage of their own passions, in order that they might find an excuse for their own debaucheries by associating such deities with them. Thus, their supreme Father of Gods and men, under the form of a bird, shamelessly carried off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> boy; and as a reward of his vile service, bestowed the cup, with leave to pledge him in an amorous draught, that they might with the nectar drink in their common shame. Besides innumerable other villanies, reprobated by the meanest of mankind, and transformations into every form of brutes, himself the most brutish of all, he becomes bi-sexual, pregnant, if not in his belly yet in his thigh, that even this violation of nature might be fulfilled in his person: whence springing, the bi-sexual dithyrambic birth outraged either sex; author of drunkenness, surfeit, and mad debauch, and all their fearful consequences. To this Aegis-wearer, this Thunderer, they attach, in spite of these majestic titles, the crime of parricide, universally regarded as the extremity of guilt; inasmuch as he dethroned <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> who unhappily had begotten him. Why need I also mention their consecration of fornication, over which they made <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> to preside, the shell-born Cyprian, who abhorred chastity as an unhallowed and monstrous thing, but delighted in fornication and all filthiness, and willed to be propitiated by them: in whose company <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> also suffers unseemly exposure, being, by the contrivance of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>, made a spectacle and laughing-stock to the Gods? Justly would one ridicule their phalli and ithyphalli, and phallagogia; their <a href=/people/806 target=_blank>Priapus</a>, and <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=demonym long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian</a> mysteries, which in one respect deserve praise, namely, that the sun was not allowed to see them, but they were condemned to dwell with darkness.

Domnus was then bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>; and he, having visited <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>, and being struck with the singularity of his position and mode of life, was desirous of more mystic intercourse. They met accordingly, and having consecrated the immaculate body, imparted to each other the life-giving communion. This man, endeavouring to realise in the flesh the existence of the heavenly hosts, lifts himself above the concerns of earth, and, overpowering the downward tendency of man's nature, is intent upon things above: placed between earth and heaven, he holds communion with God, and unites with the angels in praising him; from earth, offering his intercessions on behalf of men, and from heaven, drawing down upon them the divine favour. An account of his miracles has been written by one of those who were eye-witnesses, and an eloquent record by Theodoret, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394492WKyr class=place long=49.2343 lat=39.4192>Cyrus</a>: though they have omitted a circumstance in particular, the memory of which I found to be still retained by the inhabitants of the holy desert, and which I learnt from them as follows.

When the person, thus deputed, came and announced the command of the fathers, and <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>, in pursuance of the injunction, immediately put one foot forward, then he declared him free to fulfil his own course, saying, 'Be stout, and play the man: the post which thou hast chosen is from God.' This circumstance, which is omitted by those who have written about him, I have thus thought worthy of record. In so great a measure had the power of divine grace taken possession of him, that, when <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> had issued a mandate, that the synagogues of which they had been previously deprived by the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, should be restored to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=person long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, he wrote to the emperor with so much freedom and vehement rebuke, as standing in awe of none but his own immediate sovereign, that <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> re-called his commands, and in every respect favoured the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, even superseding the prefect who had suggested the measure. He further proceeded to prefer a request to this effect, to the holy and aerial martyr, that he would entreat and pray for him, and impart a share of his own peculiar benediction. <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> prolonged his endurance of this mode of life through fifty-six years, nine of which he spent in the first monastery, where he was instructed in divine knowledge, and forty-seven in the Mandra, as it is termed; namely, ten in a certain nook; on shorter columns, seven; and thirty upon one of forty cubits. After his departure, his holy body was conveyed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, during the episcopate of Martyrius, and the reign of the emperor <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, when Ardabyrius was in command of the forces of the East, on which occasion the troops, with a concourse of their followers and others, proceeded to the Mandra, </p>                        </div>

The emperor also demanded possession of the body; and the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> addressed to him a petition in deprecation of his purpose, in these terms: Forasmuch as our city is without walls, for we have been visited in wrath by their fall, we brought hither the sacred body to be our wall and bulwark. Moved by these considerations, the emperor yielded to their prayer, and left them in possession of the venerable body. It has been preserved nearly entire to my time: and, in company with many priests, I enjoyed the sight of his sacred head, in the episcopate of the famous <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, when Philippicus had requested that precious relics of saints might be sent to him for the protection of the Eastern armies. And, strange as is the circumstance, the hair of his head had not perished, but is in the same state of preservation as when he was alive and sojourning with mankind. The skin of his forehead, too, was wrinkled and indurated, but is nevertheless preserved, as well as the greater part of his teeth, except such as had been violently removed by the hands of faithful men, affording by their appearance an indication of the personal appearance and years of the man of God. Beside the head lies the iron collar, to which, as the companion of its endurance, the famous body has imparted a share of its own divinely-bestowed honours; for not even in death has <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> been deserted by the loving iron.

I was desirous of visiting the precinct of this saint, distant nearly thirty stadia from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Theopolis</a>, and situated near the very summit of the mountain. The people of the country give it the title of Mandra, a name bequeathed to the spot, as I suppose, by the holy <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>, in respect of the discipline which he there had practised. The ascent of the mountain is as much as twenty stadia. The temple is constructed in the form of a cross, adorned with colonnades on the four sides. Beside the colonnades are arranged handsome columns of polished stone, sustaining a roof of considerable elevation; while the centre is occupied by an unroofed court of the most excellent workmanship, where stands the pillar, of forty-cubits, on which the incarnate angel upon earth spent his heavenly life. Adjoining the roof of the colonnades is a balustrade, termed by some persons windows, forming a fence towards both the before-mentioned court and the colonnades. At the balustrade, on the left of the pillar, I saw, in company with all the people who were there assembled, while the rustics were performing dances round it, a very large and brilliant star, shooting along the whole balustrade, not merely once, twice, or thrice, but repeatedly; vanishing, moreover, frequently, and again suddenly appearing: and this occurs only at the commemorations of the saint. There are also persons who affirm—and there is no reason to doubt the prodigy, considering the credibility of the vouchers, and the other circumstances which I actually witnessed—that they have seen a resemblance of the saint's face flitting about here and there, with a long beard, and wearing a tiara, as was his habit. Free ingress is allowed to men, who repeatedly compass the pillar with their beasts of burden: but the most scrupulous precaution is taken, for what reason I am unable to say, that no woman should enter the sacred building: but they obtain a view of the prodigy from the threshold without, since one of the doors is opposite to the star's rays. </p>                        </div>

To such a degree did he waste his flesh by severe discipline, and feed his soul by elevating doctrine, as to pursue upon earth the life of angels, and be ever a living monument of monastic life and contemplation of God. Besides his numerous other writings, well stored with various profit, there are some addressed to the renowned <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>; from which it appears that he flourished contemporary with the divine bishop. And now, while endeavouring to give every attraction to my work, let me also bring upon the scene Synesius of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=person long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, whose memory will add an embellishment to my narrative. This Synesius, while possessed of every other kind of learning, carried the study of philosophy, in particular, to its highest pitch; so as to gain the admiration even of those <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> whose decision upon things which fall under their observation is not guided by favouring or adverse prejudice. They, accordingly, persuade him to resolve on partaking of the saving regeneration, and to take upon himself the yoke of the priesthood, while as yet he did not admit the doctrine of the resurrection, nor was inclined to hold that tenet; anticipating, with well-aimed conjecture, that this belief would be added to his other excellencies, since divine grace is never content to leave its work unfinished. Nor were they disappointed in their expectation: for his epistles, written after his accession to the priesthood, and composed with elegance and learning, as well as his discourse addressed to <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> himself, and whatever is extant of his valuable writings, sufficiently show how excellent and great a man he was. </p>                        </div>

Thus, what was formerly the shrine of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, became a sanctuary and holy precinct for <a href=/people/4567 target=_blank>Ignatius</a>, by depositing there his sacred remains, which were conveyed on a car through the city, attended by a solemn procession.

At all events, when visiting the holy city of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, she did many things for the honour of our <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> God, even so far as to erect holy monasteries, and what are termed laurae. In these places the mode of life is different, but the discipline of each terminates in the same devout object. For those who live together in companies are still not under the influence of any of those things which weigh down to the earth, since they possess no gold: but why should I say gold? when no article of even dress or food is the sole property of any one among them, but the gown or vest which one is now wearing, another presently puts on, so that the clothing of all appears to belong to one, and that of one to all. A common table also is set before them, not delicately furnished with meats or any other dainties, but supplied with fare of herbs and pulse, and that only in sufficient quantity to sustain life. They maintain common supplications to God throughout the day and night, to such a degree distressing themselves, so galling themselves by their severe service, as to seem, in a manner, tombless corpses. They also frequently practice superadditions, as they are called, namely, by maintaining their fastings for two or three days; and some on the fifth day, or even later, scarcely allow themselves a portion of necessary food. On the other hand, there is a class who pursue a contrary course, and individually seclude themselves in chambers of so limited a height and width, that they can neither stand upright nor lie down at ease, confining their existence to dens and caves of the earth, as says the apostle. Some, too, take up their dwelling with the wild beasts, and in untracked recesses of the ground; and thus offer their supplications to God. Another mode has also been devised, one which reaches to the utmost extent of resolution and endurance: for transporting themselves to a scorched wilderness, and covering only those parts which nature requires to be concealed, both men and women leave the rest of their persons exposed both to excessive frosts and scorching blasts, regardless alike of heat and cold. They, moreover, cast off the ordinary food of mankind, and feed upon the produce of the ground, whence they are termed Grazers; allowing themselves no more than is barely sufficient to sustain life. In consequence, they at length became assimilated to wild beasts, with their outward form altogether disfigured, and their mind in a state no longer fitted for intercourse with their species, whom they even shun when they see them; and, on being pursued, contrive to escape, favoured either by their swiftness of foot, or by places difficult of access. </p>                        </div>

Its numbers are very small; but still there are persons, who, when by virtue they have attained to a condition exempt from passion, return to the world. In the midst of the stir, by plainly intimating that they are indifferent to those who view them with amazement, they thus trample under foot vain-glory, the last garment, according to the wise <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, which it is the nature of the soul to cast off. By similar means they study the art of apathy in eating, practising it even, if need be, with the petty retailers of victuals. They also constantly frequent the public baths, mostly mingling and bathing with women, since they have attained to such an ascendancy over their passions, as to possess dominion over nature, and neither by sight, touch, or even embracing of the female, to relapse into their natural condition; it being their desire to be men among men, and women among women, and to participate in both sexes. In short, by a life thus all excellent and divine, virtue exercises a sovereignty in opposition to nature, establishing her own laws, so as not to allow them to partake to satiety in any necessary. Indeed, their own rule enjoins them to hunger and thirst, and to clothe the body only so far as necessity requires: and their mode of life is balanced by opposite scales, so accurately poised, that they are unconscious of any tendency to motion, though arising from strongly antagonist forces; for opposing principles are, in their case, mingled to such a degree, by the power of divine grace combining and again severing things that are incongruous, that life and death dwell together in them, things opposed to each other in nature and in circumstances: for where passion enters, they must be dead and entombed; where prayer to God is required, they must display vigour of body and energy of spirit, though the flower of life be past. Thus with them are the two modes of life combined, so as to be constantly living with a total renunciation of the flesh, and at the same time mingling with the living; both applying remedies to their bodies, and presenting to God the cries of suppliants, and in all other respects fully maintaining a practice in accordance with their former mode of life, except as regards restriction in intercourse and place: on the contrary, they listen to all, and associate with all. They also practise a long and continuous series of kneelings and risings, their earnestness alone serving to reinvigorate their years and self-inflicted weakness; being, as it were, fleshless athletes, bloodless wrestlers, esteeming fasting as a varied and luxurious feast, and the utmost abstinence from food a completely furnished table. On the other hand, whenever a stranger visits them, even at early dawn, they welcome him with generous entertainment, devising another form of fasting in eating against their will. Hence the marvel, how far the pittance on which they subsist falls short of a sufficient allowance of food; foes of their own desires and of nature, but devoted to the wills of those around them, in order that fleshly enjoyment may be constantly expelled, and the soul, diligently selecting and maintaining whatever is most seemly and pleasing to God, may alone bear sway: happy in their mode of existence here, happier in their departure hence, on which they are ever intent, impatient to behold Him whom they desire. </p>                        </div>

On going up to it—for, besides the excellence of his other virtues, he was singularly compassionate—he commiserated the occurrence, and suspended his journey for some time, from a desire to discharge the due offices to the dead. Some persons, observing the circumstance, reported it to the authorities at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421247PPhi class=place long=24.751 lat=42.1468>Philippopolis</a>, and they proceeded to apprehend <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, and interrogated him respecting the murder: and when, through the prevalence of conjecture and mere probability over truth and asseveration of innocence, he was upon the point of suffering the punishment of guilt, </p>                        </div>

After this unexpected escape, he presents himself to one of the military bodies stationed in the place, with the intention of enlistment. Struck with the singularity of his fortunes, and with reason concluding that he would arrive at power and preeminent distinction, they gladly admitted him, and that too without placing him, according to military rule, lowest on the roll; but they assigned to him the grade of a lately deceased soldier, named <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, by inscribing in the list, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, called also <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. Thus did his name anticipate the style of our sovereigns, who assume the title of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> on attaining the purple. It was as if the name refused to abide on him without its appropriate rank, and, on the other hand, the rank was not ambitious of another name for the augmentation of its style: and thus arose an identity of his personal and titular appellations, since his dignity and his name found an expression in the same term. Another circumstance also occurred, which might serve as a prognostic of the imperial power being destined to <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>. When serving under Aspar against the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, he was one of many who fell into their hands on the total defeat of that general; and, on the demand of. Genseric to see the prisoners, was dragged with the rest along the plain. When the whole body was collected, Genseric sat in an upper chamber, surveying with delight the numbers that had been taken. As the time wore on, they pursued each his own inclination, for the guard had, at the order of Genseric, released them from their bonds; and while they accordingly disposed of themselves each in his several way, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> laid himself down upon the ground to sleep in the sun, which was shining with unusual heat for the season of the year.

But let us leave this digression, and return to my subject. <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> was pious towards God, and just towards those under his rule; regarding as wealth neither treasured stores nor the revenue of imposts, but only the means of providing relief to the needy, and to the wealthy the security of their possessions. He was dreaded, not in the infliction of punishment, but only by its anticipation. On this account he received the sovereignty not as an inheritance, but as the prize of virtue, conferred by the unanimous voice both of the senate and men of all ranks, at the suggestion of Pulcheria, whom he also espoused as his partner in the imperial dignity, though she still remained a virgin to old age. These transactions took place without a previous ratification of the choice by <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, the emperor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who, however, accorded his approval to the virtues of the person elected. It was further the desire of <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, that an undivided service should be offered up by all to God, by uniting in pious concord the tongues which the arts of impiety had confounded, and that the Deity should be honoured by one and the same doxology. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, who had been president of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398305UDor class=place long=30.529 lat=39.784>Dorylaeum</a>, was especially urgent, and affirmed that both himself and Flavian had been deposed by the intrigues of Chrysaphius, the minister of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, because, in reply to his demand of an offering in gold, Flavian had, in acknowledgment of his own appointment, sent the sacred vessels to shame him; and also that Chrysaphius made a near approach to <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> in erroneous doctrine. He also said, that Flavian had even been brought to a miserable end by being thrust and trampled on by <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> himself. These circumstances caused the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> to be assembled; for which purpose the bearers of missives were despatched, and the prelates in all quarters were summoned by pious letters. The place named was, in the first instance, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>; and, accordingly, <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, on writing an epistle respecting Paschasianus, Lucentius, and others, whom he had sent as his representatives, inscribed it to the council assembled at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>. It was, however, subsequently convened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405295RBit class=place long=29.5 lat=40.5>Bithynia</a>. <a href=/people/8502 target=_blank>Zacharias</a>, the rhetorician, influenced by partiality, says that Nestorius was also fetched from his place of exile: but this is disproved by the circumstance, that Nestorius was generally anathematised by the members of the synod. And <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>, clearly establishes the point, when writing in the following terms to John, a bishop, and another John, a presbyter, respecting the matters agitated in the assembly. Those who were in quest of the remains of Nestorius, again presenting themselves, clamorously demanded of the synod, why the saints are anathematised: so that the emperor indignantly ordered the guards to drive them far from the place. How then Nestorius was summoned, when he had departed from the world, I am unable to say. </p>                        </div>

The site is a beautiful spot, of so gentle an ascent, that those who are on their way to the temple, are not aware of their immediate approach, but suddenly find themselves within the sanctuary on elevated ground; so that, extending their gaze from a commanding position, they can survey the level surface of the plain spread out beneath them, green with herbage, waving with corn, and beautified with every kind of tree; at the same time including within their range woody mountains, towering gracefully or boldly swelling, as well as parts of the sea under various aspects: here, where the winds do not reach them, the still waters, with their dark blue tint, sweetly playing with gentle ripple on the beach; there wildly surging, and sweeping back the sea-weeds and the lighter shell-fish with the recoil of its waves. Directly opposite is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>: and thus the beauty of the site is enhanced by the view of so vast a city. The holy place consists of three immense buildings. One is open to the sky, including a court of great extent, and embellished on all sides with columns; and next to it another, nearly resembling it in its length, breadth, and columns, and differing from it only in being roofed. On the north side of this, facing the East, is a round building, skilfully terminated in a dome, and surrounded in the interior with columns of uniform materials and size. These support a gallery under the same roof, so contrived, that those who are disposed, may thence both supplicate the martyr and be present at the mysteries. Within the domed building, towards the Eastern part, is a splendid enclosure, where are preserved the sacred remains of the martyr in a long coffin (it is distinguished by some persons by the term long) of silver, skilfully worked. The wonders which have at certain times been wrought by the holy martyr, are manifest to all <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. For frequently she has appeared in a dream to the bishops of the city from time to time, and even to certain persons whose lives have been otherwise distinguished, and has bid them visit her and gather a vintage at her sanctuary. When such an occurrence has been ascertained by the sovereigns, the patriarch, and the city, they visit the temple, both those who sway the sceptre, and those who are invested with sacred and civil offices, as well as the whole multitude, desirous to partake in the mysteries. Accordingly, the president of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, with his attendant priests, enters, in sight of the public, the sanctuary where the already-mentioned sacred body is deposited. There is an aperture in the left side of the coffin, secured with small doors, through which they introduce a sponge attached to an iron rod, so as to reach the sacred relics, and after turning it round, they draw it out, covered with stains and clots of blood. On witnessing this, all the people bend in worship, giving glory to God. So great has been the quantity of blood thus extracted, that both the pious sovereigns and the assembled priests, as well as the congregated people, all share in a liberal distribution, and portions are sent to those of the faithful who desire them, in every place under the sun. The clots also are permanent, neither does the appearance of the sacred blood undergo any change. These divine manifestations occur not at the recurrence of any definite period, but according as the life of the prelate or gravity of manners calls for them. Accordingly it is said, that when the governor of the church is a person reverend and remarkable for virtues, the marvel occurs with peculiar frequency; but when such is not his character, such divine operations are rarely displayed. I will, however, mention a circumstance which suffers no interruption depending on lapse of time or seasonable occasion, nor yet is vouchsafed with a distinction between the faithful and infidels, but to all indiscriminately. Whenever any person approaches the spot where is deposited the precious coffin in which are the holy relics, he is filled with an odour surpassing in sweetness every perfume with which mankind are acquainted, for it resembles neither the mingled fragrance of the meadows, nor that which is exhaled from the sweetest substances, nor is it such as any perfumer could prepare: but it is of a peculiar and surpassing kind, of itself sufficiently indicating the virtue of its source. </p>                        </div>

By way of a cursory statement of the more important points, I mention, that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> was convicted of having suppressed the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, bishop of the elder <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and farther, of having enacted the deposition of Flavian, bishop of new <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in the space of a single day, and procured the subscriptions of the assembled prelates to a blank paper, represented as containing the form of the deposition. Upon these grounds, the senators decreed as follows: Of points relating to the orthodox and catholic faith, we are agreed that a more exact inquiry should take place before a fuller assembly of the council, at its next meeting. But inasmuch as it has been shewn, from examination of the acts and decrees, and from the oral testimony of the presidents of that synod, who admit that themselves were in error, and the deposition was void, that Flavian, of pious memory, and the most reverent bishop <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, were convicted of no error concerning the faith, and were wrongfully deposed, it seems to us, according to God's good pleasure, to be a just proceeding, if approved by our most divine and pious sovereign, that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>; Juvenalis, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; <a href=/people/3088 target=_blank>Thalassius</a>, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387355UMaz class=place long=35.4881 lat=38.7207>Caesarea</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>; <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392289UAnk class=place long=32.863 lat=39.95>Ancyra</a>; <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a>, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>; and Basilius, the most reverent bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364339PSel class=place long=33.9165 lat=36.3765>Seleucia</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a>; who exercised sway and precedency in that synod; should be subjected to the selfsame penalty, by suffering at the hands of the holy synod deprivation of their episcopal dignity, according to the canons; whatever is consequent hereupon, being submitted to the cognizance of the emperor's sacred supremacy. <br />On the presentation of libelli against <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> at the next meeting of the council, containing charges of slander and extortion, and his refusal, for certain alleged reasons, to appear, after a twice and thrice repeated summons, the representatives of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, bishop of the elder <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, made the following declaration:—The aggressions committed by <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, lately bishop of the great city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, in violation of canonical order and the constitution of the church, have been clearly proved by the investigations at the former meeting, and the proceedings of to-day. For, not to mention the mass of his offences, he did, on his own authority, uncanonically admit to communion his partisan <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, after having been canonically deprived by his own bishop, namely, our sainted father and archbishop Flavian; and this before he sat in council with the other bishops at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. </p>                        </div>

Whereas <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> has continued to maintain a haughty carriage, on account of those very circumstances over which he ought to have bewailed and humbled himself to the earth. Moreover, he did not even allow the epistle to be read which the blessed pope <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> had addressed to Flavian, of holy memory; and that too, notwithstanding he was repeatedly exhorted thereto by the bearers, and had promised with an oath to that effect. The result of the epistle not being read, has been to fill the most holy churches throughout the world with scandals and mischief. Notwithstanding, however, such presumption, it was our purpose to deal mercifully with him as regards his past impiety, as we had done to the other bishops, although they had not held an equal judicial authority with him. But inasmuch as he has, by his subsequent conduct, overshot his former iniquity, and has presumed to pronounce excommunication against <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, the most holy and religious archbishop of great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; since, moreover, on the presentation of a paper full of grievous charges against him to the holy and great synod, he refused to appear, though once, twice, and thrice canonically summoned by the bishops, pricked no doubt by his own conscience; and since he has unlawfully given reception to those who had been duly deposed by different synods; he has thus, by variously trampling upon the laws of the church, given his own verdict against himself. Wherefore <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, the most blessed and holy archbishop of the great and elder <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, has, by the agency of ourselves and the present synod, in conjunction with the thrice-blessed and all honoured Peter, who is the rock and basis of the Catholic church, and the foundation of the orthodox faith, deprived him of the episcopal dignity, and severed him from every priestly function. Accordingly, this holy and great synod decrees the provisions of the canons on the aforesaid <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>. <br />After the ratification of these measures by the synod, and the transaction of some other matters, those who had been deposed together with <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, were reinstated, at the request of the synod and the assent of the imperial government; and, after some further transactions, a definition of faith was enounced in these precise words: Our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, while confirming the knowledge of the faith in his disciples said, 'My peace I give to you; my peace I leave to you;' to the purpose, that no one should differ from his neighbour in the doctrines of piety, but should accord in publishing the declaration of the truth. After the reading of the holy Nicene creed, and also that of the hundred and fifty holy fathers, they subjoined as follows: This wise and salutary symbol of divine grace is indeed sufficient for the perfect knowledge and confirmation of godliness; for, concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, its teaching is plain and complete, and it sufficiently suggests the incarnation of the Lord to those who receive it faithfully. </p>                        </div>

In respect to those who have dared to corrupt the mystery of the economy, and with shameless wantonness to represent Him who was born of the holy Virgin as a mere man, the, council has adopted the synodic epistles of the blessed <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, pastor of the church of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, addressed to Nestorius and the prelates of the East, in refutation of the madness of Nestorius, and for the instruction of those who with pious zeal are desirous of being impressed with a due conception of the saving symbol.

It also ejects such as fondly fancy that the form of a servant which He assumed from our own nature, was of a heavenly or any other substance; and it anathematises those who fable a resolution into one, at their union, of two previous natures of the Lord. Following, accordingly, the holy fathers, we confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and we all with one voice declare him to be at the same time perfect in Godhead, and perfect in manhood, very God, and at the same time very man, consisting of a reasonable soul and a body, being consubstantial with the Father as respects his Godhead, and at the same time con substantial with ourselves as respects his manhood; resembling us in all things, independently of sin; begotten, before the ages, of the Father, according to his Godhead, but born, in the last of the days, of Mary, the virgin and mother of God, for our sakes and for our salvation; being one and the same Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, made known in two natures without confusion, without conversion, without severance, without separation, inasmuch as the difference of the natures is in no way annulled by their union, but the peculiar essence of each nature is rather preserved, and conspires in one person and one subsistence, not as though he were parted or severed into two persons, but is one and the same Son, Only-begotten, Divine Word, Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, as the prophets declared concerning Him, and <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> himself has fully instructed us, and the symbol of the fathers has conveyed to us. Since, then, these matters have been defined by us with all accuracy and diligence, the holy and universal synod has determined that no one shall be at liberty to put forth another faith, whether in writing, or by framing, or devising, or teaching it to others. And that those who shall presume to frame, or publish, or teach another faith, or to communicate another symbol to those who are disposed to turn to the knowledge of the truth from heathenism or Judaism, or any other sect—that they, if they be bishops or clerks, shall suffer deprivation, the bishops of their episcopal, the clerks of their clerical office; and if monks or laics, shall be anathematised.

Juvenalis also and <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> arranged on mutual terms the matters relating to their own provinces, and Theodoret and Ibas were reinstated. Other matters were also mooted; an account of which, as I have already said, is subjoined to this history.

On his taking possession of his see, a very great and intolerable tumult arose among the people, who were roused into a storm against conflicting opinions; for some, as is likely in such cases, desired the restoration of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, while others resolutely upheld Proterius, so as to give rise to many irremediable mischiefs. Thus <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>, the rhetorician, recounts, that he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebaid</a>, and that he saw the populace advancing in a mass against the magistrates: that when the troops attempted to repress the tumult, they proceeded to assail them with stones, and put them to flight, and on their taking refuge in the old temple of <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a>, carried the place by assault, and committed them alive to the flames: that the emperor, when informed of these events, despatched two thousand newly levied troops, who made so favourable a passage, as to reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> on the sixth day; and that thence resulted still more alarming consequences, from the license of the soldiery towards the wives and daughters of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>: that, subsequently, the people, being assembled in the hippodrome, entreated Floras, who was the military commandant, as well as the civil governor, with such urgency as to procure terms for themselves, in the distribution of provisions, of which he had deprived them, as well as the privileges of the baths and spectacles, and all others from which, on account of their turbulence, they had been debarred: that, at his suggestion, Floras presented himself to the people, and pledged himself to that effect, and by this means stopped the sedition for a time. Nor did even the wilderness in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> preserve its tranquillity, unvisited by this commotion. For there arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> some of the monks who had been present at the council, but were disposed to harbour designs in opposition to it; and by lamenting the betrayal of the faith, exerted themselves to fan into a flame the monastic body. And when Juvenalis, after obtaining restitution to his see, had been compelled to return to the imperial city, by the violence of the party who claimed the right to supersede and anathematise in their own province, those who, as we have already mentioned, were opposed to the acts of the council of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, assembled in the church of the Resurrection, and appointed <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, who had especially caused confusion in the council, and been the first to bring a report of its proceedings, and respecting whom, at a subsequent period, the monks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> alleged, in letters to Alcison, that having been convicted of malpractices in relation to his own bishop, he had been expelled from his monastery: and that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> he had impugned the conduct of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, and, after having been severely scourged as a seditious person, had been conveyed round the city on a <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>camel</a>, as is usual with malefactors. To him many of the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> made application, with a view to the ordination of bishops. Among these was Peter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=demonym long=43.5 lat=42>Iberian</a>; to whom was committed the episcopal helm of the city called Majumas, in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>. On being informed of these proceedings, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, in the first place, commands <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> to be conveyed near his own person, and sends Juvenalis to rectify the past, with an injunction that all who had been ordained by <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a> should be ejected. Many sad occurrences followed the arrival of Juvenalis, while either party indulged in whatever proceedings their anger suggested. Such was the device of the envious and God-hating demon in the change of a single letter, that, while in reality the one expression was completely inductive of the notion of the other, still with the generality the discrepancy between them was held to be considerable, and the ideas conveyed by them to be clearly in diametric opposition, and exclusive of each other: whereas he who confesses <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> in two natures, clearly affirms Him to be from two; inasmuch as by confessing <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> at once in Godhead and manhood, he asserts His consistence from Godhead and manhood; and, on the other hand, the position of one who affirms His origin from two natures, is completely inclusive of His existence in two, inasmuch as he who affirms <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> to be from Godhead and manhood, confesses His existence in Godhead and manhood, since there is no conversion of the flesh into Godhead, nor a transition of the Godhead into flesh, from which substances arises the ineffable union. So that in this case by the expression, from two natures, is aptly suggested the thought of the expression, in two, and conversely; nor can there be a severance of the terms, this being an instance where a representation of the whole is afforded, not merely by its origin from component parts, but, as a further and distinct means, by its existence in them. Yet, nevertheless, persons have so taken up the idea of the marked distinction of the terms, either from a habit of thought respecting the glory of God, or by the inclination forestalling the judgment, as to be reckless of death in any shape, rather than acknowledge the real state of the case; and hence arose the occurrences which I have described. Such then was the state of these matters. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> forces Eudoxia, the wife of <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, into a marriage with himself; and she, justly regarding the transaction as an outrage and altogether monstrous, determined to set, as the saying is, all upon a cast, on account of the wrong she had suffered both in the person of her husband and the infringement of her liberty: for a woman, jealous of her chastity, is unscrupulous and implacable if she has suffered defilement, especially by one through whose means she has been deprived of her husband. Accordingly, she sends to Genseric, in Africa, and by considerable presents, as well as by holding out confident expectations of the future, induces him to make a sudden descent upon the Roman empire, with a promise of betraying every thing into his hands. This was accordingly done, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> captured.

The elder daughter, <a href=/people/5000 target=_blank>Eudocia</a>, he espouses to his own son, Huneric; but the younger, Placidia, he subsequently sends, together with her mother Eudoxia, with a royal escort to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, with the view of pacifying <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, who was exasperated both by the burning of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the outrage upon the royal ladies.

On learning this event, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> renewed their feud against Proterius with still greater exasperation and excessive heat: for the populace in general are an inflammable material, and allow very trivial pretexts to foment the flame of commotion, and not in the least degree that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, which presumes on its numbers, chiefly an obscure and promiscuous rabble, and vaunts forth its impulses with excessive audacity. Accordingly, it is said that every one who is so disposed may, by employing any casual circumstance as a means of excitement, inspire the city with a frenzy of sedition, and hurry the populace in whatever direction and against whomsoever he chooses. Their general humour, however, is even of a sportive kind, as <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> records to have been the case with <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>. Such, then, is the character of this people; who were, however, in all other respects by no means contemptible. The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, accordingly, taking advantage of the prolonged absence of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, commander of the legions, in Upper .<a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, decree the elevation to the highest priestly grade, of <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, surnamed Aelurus, who had formerly followed the monastic life, but had subsequently been admitted among the presbyters of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>; and, conducting him to the great church, styled that of Caesar, elect him their bishop, though Proterius was still alive and discharged the functions of his office. There were present at the election, <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, president of the church of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, and Peter the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=demonym long=43.5 lat=42>Iberian</a>, bishop of the town of Majumas, according to the account given of the transaction by the writer of the life of Peter, who also says that Proterius was not killed by the populace, but by one of the soldiers. When <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, on account of the urgency of these disorders, had occupied the city with the utmost dispatch, and was taking prompt measures to quench the towering conflagration of the sedition, some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>, at the instigation of <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, according to the written report made to <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, despatch Proterius when he appeared, by thrusting a sword through his bowels, after he had fled for refuge to the holy baptistery. Suspending the body by a cord, they displayed it to the public in the quarter called Tetrapylum, jeering and vociferating that the victim was Proterius; and, after dragging it through the whole city, committed it to the flames; not even refraining themselves from tasting his intestines, like beasts of prey, according to the account of the entire transaction contained in the petition addressed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> bishops and the whole clergy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> to <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, who, as has been said, was invested with the imperial power on the death of <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>.

And afterwards it proceeds: And having watched the opportunity afforded by the departure from this world to God of the emperor <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, of sacred memory, assuming then in blasphemous terms a bold tone of independence, and shamelessly anathematising the holy and general synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, while he drew after him a mercenary and disorderly multitude, and assailed the divine canons and ecclesiastical order, the commonwealth and the laws, he intruded himself upon the holy church of God, which at that time was possessed of a pastor and teacher in the person of our most holy father and archbishop, Proterius, duly performing the ordinary rites, and offering up to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> of us all, supplications in behalf of your pious sovereignty and your <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>-loving court.

And further on: The blessed man could do nothing else than give place to wrath, according to what is written, and take refuge in the venerable baptistery from the assault of those who were pursuing him to death, a place which especially inspires awe even into barbarians and savages, though ignorant of its dignity, and the grace which flows from it. Notwithstanding, however, those who were eager to carry into execution the design which <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> had from the first conceived, and who could not endure that his life should be protected by those undefiled precincts, neither reverenced the dignity of the place, nor yet the season (for it was the solemnity of the saving paschal feast), nor were awe-struck at the priestly office which mediates between God and man; but put the blameless man to death, cruelly butchering him with six others.

Well may we now say, my lord: Blessed be God, who has not rejected our prayer, nor withdrawn his mercy from us sinners. For, on the receipt of the letters of your worthiness, I admired the zeal and piety of our sovereign, beloved of God, which he manifested and still manifests towards the holy fathers and their unshaken faith. And this gift is not from ourselves, as says the holy apostle, but from God, who, through your prayers, bestowed on him this readiness of mind. And presently he proceeds: On this account, I also, though mean and worthless, the refuse of the monks, have conveyed to his majesty my judgment respecting the creed of the six hundred and thirty holy fathers assembled at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, firmly resolving to abide by the faith then revealed by the Holy Spirit: for if, in the midst of two or three who are gathered in His name, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> is present, how could it be otherwise, than that the Holy Spirit should be throughout in the midst of so many and so distinguished holy fathers? And afterwards he proceeds: Wherefore be stout and courageous in the cause of true piety, as was also <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, in behalf of the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>. I beg you to salute from me all the reverent clergy who are under your holiness, and the blessed and most faithful laity. </p>                        </div>

This grievous visitation occurred in the five hundred and sixth year of the free prerogatives of the city, about the fourth hour of the night, on the fourteenth day of the month Gorpiaeus, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> call September, on the eve of the Lord's day, in the eleventh cycle of the indiction; and was the sixth on record after a lapse of three hundred and forty-seven years, since the earthquake under <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>; for that occurred when the city was in the hundred and fifty-ninth year of its independence; but this, which happened in the time of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, in the five hundred and sixth, according to the most diligent authorities. This earthquake threw down nearly all the houses of the New City, which was very populous, and contained not a single vacant or altogether unoccupied spot, but had been highly embellished by the rival liberality of the emperors. Of the structures composing the palace, the first and second were thrown down: the rest, however, remained standing, together with the adjoining baths, which, having been previously useless, were now rendered serviceable to the necessities of the city, arising from the damage of the others. It also levelled the porticoes in front of the palace and the adjacent Tetrapylum, as well as the towers of the Hippodrome, which flanked the entrances, and some of the porticoes adjoining them. In the Old City, the porticoes and dwellings entirely escaped the overthrow; but it shattered a small portion of the baths of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, and <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, and also laid in ruins some parts of the quarter of houses named Ostracine, together with the porticoes, and levelled what was called the Nymphaeum. All these circumstances have been minutely detailed by John the rhetorician. He says, that a thousand talents of gold were remitted to the city from the tributes by the emperor; and, besides, to individual citizens, the imposts of the houses destroyed: and that he also took measures for the restoration both of them and of the public buildings. </p>                        </div>

The circumstances of the case are as follow:—At the synod lately held at the metropolitan city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=ethnic long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesians</a>— would that it had never met, nor the world been thereby filled with mischiefs and tumult—the excellent <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, regarding neither the principle of justice nor the fear of God, sharing also in the opinions and feelings of the visionary and heretical <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, though unsuspected by the multitude of being such as he afterwards shewed himself, took occasion of the charge advanced by me against his fellow in doctrine, <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, and the decision given by the sainted bishop Flavian, and having gathered a disorderly rabble, and procured an overbearing influence by bribes, made havoc as far as lay in his power, of the pious religion of the orthodox, and established the erroneous doctrine of <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> the monk, which had from the first been repudiated by the holy fathers. Since, then, his aggressions against the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> faith and us are of no trifling magnitude, we beseech and supplicate your majesty to issue your commands to the same most reverent bishop <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, to defend himself against our allegations; namely, when the record of the acts which <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> procured against us, shall be read before the holy synod; on the ground of which we are able to shew, that he is estranged from the orthodox faith, that he strengthened a heresy utterly impious, that he wrongfully deposed and has cruelly outraged us. And this we will do on the issuing of your divine and revered mandates to the holy and universal synod of the bishops, highly beloved of God, to the effect, that they should give a formal hearing to the matters which concern both us and the before-mentioned <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, and refer all the transactions to the decision of your piety, as shall seem fit to your immortal supremacy. If we obtain this our request, we shall ever pray for your everlasting rule, most divine sovereigns. <br />At the joint request of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> and <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, the transactions of the second synod of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> were publicly read; from which it appeared that the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> had not obtained a reading, and that, too, when mention of the subject had been twice started. <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, being called upon to state the reason of this, said expressly that he had twice proposed that it should be done; and he then required that Juvenalis, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and <a href=/people/3088 target=_blank>Thalassius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387355UMaz class=place long=35.4881 lat=38.7207>Caesarea</a>, metropolis of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> Prima, should explain the circumstances, since they shared the presidency with himself. Juvenalis accordingly said, that the reading of a sacred rescript, having precedency, had, at his decision, been interposed, and that no one had subsequently mentioned the epistle. </p>                        </div>

It was then decided that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> should be sought in front of the place of meeting; and, on his not being found, <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, ruled that he ought to be summoned, and be present before the synod.

Afterwards, persons were again sent with a commission to urge <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> to appear; who, on their return, said that they had taken notes of his words. From these it appears that he said: I have already signified to your piety, both that I am suffering from sickness, and that I demand that the most illustrious magistrates and the sacred senate should also on the present occasion attend the investigation of the matters at issue. Since, however, my sickness has increased, on this ground I am withholding my attendance. Cecropius, then, as appears from the acts, intimated to <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, that but a short time before he had made no mention of sickness, and, accordingly, he ought to satisfy the requisitions of the canons. To whom <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> rejoined: I have said once for all, that the magistrates ought to be present.

The acts shew that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> said in answer, that he prayed the <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>-loving emperor to the effect that the magistrates should be present, and also those who had acted as judges in conjunction with himself. To this the deputies rejoined, that <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> accused him only, and there was accordingly no occasion that all should be present. <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> replied, that the others who had acted with him ought to be present, for the suit of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> did not affect himself individually, but rested in fact upon a judgment in which they had all united.

When, accordingly, in the first place <a href=/people/6987 target=_blank>Theodoras</a>, a deacon of the holy church at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, had presented libelli, and afterwards Ischyrion, a deacon, <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, a presbyter, and nephew of <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, and also Sophronius, in which they charged <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> with blasphemies, offences against the person, and violent seizures of money; a third summons was issued urging him to attend. Those who were accordingly selected for this service, on their return, reported <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> to have said: I have already sufficiently informed your piety on this point, and cannot add any thing further. Since <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> had persisted in the same reply, while the delegates continued to press him, the bishop Paschasinus said: At length, after being summoned a third time, <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> has not appeared: and he then asked what treatment he deserved. To this, when the bishops had replied that he had rendered himself obnoxious to the canons, and Proterius, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a>, had observed, that when Flavian had been murdered, no suitable measures had been taken with respect to him; the representatives of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, bishop of the elder <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, made a declaration as follows: — —The aggressions committed by <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, lately bishop of the great city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, in violation of canonical order and the constitution of the church, have been clearly proved by the investigations at the former meeting, and the proceedings of to-day. For, not to mention the mass of his offences, he did, on his own authority, uncanonically admit to communion his partisan <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, after having been canonically deprived by his own bishop, namely, our sainted father and archbishop Flavian; and this before he sat in council with the other bishops at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>. To them, indeed, the holy see granted pardon for the transactions of which they were not the deliberate authors, and they have hitherto continued obedient to the most holy archbishop <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, and the body of the holy and universal synod; on which account he also admitted them into communion with him, as being his fellows in faith. Whereas <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> has continued to maintain a haughty carriage, on account of those very circumstances over which he ought to have bewailed, and humbled himself to the earth. Moreover, he did not even allow the epistle to be read which the blessed pope <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> had addressed to Flavian, of holy memory; and that too, notwithstanding he was repeatedly exhorted thereto by the bearers, and had promised with an oath to that effect. The result of the epistle not being rend, has been to fill the most holy churches throughout the world with scandals and mischief. Notwithstanding, however, such presumption, it was our purpose to deal mercifully with him as regards his past impiety, as we had done with the other bishops, although they had not held an equal judicial authority with him. But inasmuch as he has, by his subsequent conduct, overshot his former iniquity, and has presumed to pronounce excommunication against <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, the most holy and religious archbishop of great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; since, moreover, on the presentation of a paper full of grievous charges against him to the holy and great synod, he refused to appear, though once, twice, and thrice canonically summoned by the bishops, pricked no doubt by his own conscience; and since he has unlawfully given reception to those who had been duly deposed by different synods; he has thus, by variously trampling upon the laws of the church, given his own verdict against himself. Wherefore <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, the most blessed and holy archbishop of the great and elder <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, has, by the agency of ourselves and the present synod, in conjunction with the thrice-blessed and all honoured Peter, who is the rock and basis of the Catholic church, and the foundation of the orthodox faith, </p>                        </div>

After the bishops had with one voice exclaimed, that they all held the same language, and the magistrates had ruled that each patriarch, selecting one or two persons of his own diocese, should come forward into the midst of the council in order to a declaration of their several opinions; <a href=/people/2106 target=_blank>Florentius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>, prayed a respite, so that they might approach the truth with due deliberation: and Cecropius, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400361UHer class=place long=36.0833 lat=39.9967>Sebastopolis</a>, spoke as follows. The faith has been well set forth by the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers, and has been confirmed by the holy fathers, <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, Celestine, Hilary, <a href=/people/1504 target=_blank>Basil</a>, <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, and again, on the present occasion, by the most holy <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>. We accordingly require that the words both of the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers and of the most holy <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> be now read. At the conclusion of the reading the whole synod exclaimed, This is the faith of the orthodox; thus we all believe; thus does the Pope <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> believe; thus did <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> believe; thus has the Pope expounded. <br />Another interlocution was then issued, that the form set forth by the hundred and fifty fathers should also be read: which was accordingly done; and the members of the synod exclaimed, This is the faith of all; this is the faith of the orthodox; thus do we all believe! <br />Then <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, the archdeacon, said that he held in his hand the epistle of the divine <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> to Nestorius, which all who were assembled at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> had ratified by their individual subscriptions; as also another epistle of the same <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> addressed to John of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, which had itself also been confirmed.

Certain persons, as I am informed, treat my rebuke with levity in the presence of your holiness, and that, too, repeatedly, taking especial occasion for that purpose of the meetings of the authorities; perhaps also with the idea of gratifying your own ears. Afterwards it proceeds. The declaration, then, of the holy and great synod was this: that the only begotten Son, begotten naturally of God the Father, very God of very God, light of light, by whose agency the Father made all things, descended, was incarnate, assumed humanity, suffered, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven. This declaration we, too, ought to follow, carefully considering what is signified by the expression, that the Divine Word was incarnate and assumed humanity. For we do not affirm that the nature of the Word by undergoing a change became flesh, nor yet was even converted into a complete human being, consisting of soul and body; but this we rather maintain, that the Word, by uniting personally with himself flesh, animated by a rational soul, became man in an ineffable and incomprehensible manner, and bore the title of the Son of Man, not in respect of mere will or pleasure, nor even, as it were, in an assumption of person merely; and, further, that the natures which conspired to the true unity, were different, but from both is one <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and Son; not as though the difference of the natures had been done away for the sake of the union, but they had rather consummated for us the one Lord and <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and Son, from both the Godhead and the manhood, by their ineffable and mysterious coalition for unity. And presently the epistle proceeds. But since, for our sakes and for our salvation, having personally united humanity with himself, he came forth from a woman; in this respect he is said also to have been born carnally. For he was not born in the first instance an ordinary man of the holy Virgin, and then the Word descended upon him: but the Word, having been united from the very womb, is said to have undergone a carnal nativity, as it were, by an assumption of the nativity of his own flesh. In this manner we say that He suffered and rose again; not as though the Word of God had endured, as regards his own nature, stripes or piercings of nails, or the other wounds, for the Deity is impassible, as being incorporeal. Since, however, his own body underwent these circumstances, Himself is said, on the other hand, to have suffered them on our behalf, inasmuch as the impassible being was in the suffering body. <br />The greater part of the other epistle has been inserted in the preceding portion of this history. It contains, however, a passage to the following effect, which John, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> wrote, and <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> entirely approved. We confess the holy Virgin to be the Mother of God, because from her the Divine Word was incarnate and assumed humanity, and from the very conception united with himself the temple which was derived from her. With respect, however, to the evangelical and apostolical language concerning our Lord, we know that the expressions of the divinely inspired men are sometimes comprehensive, as in respect of a single person; sometimes distinctive, as in respect of two natures; and that they deliver such as are of divine import, in reference to the Godhead of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and those which are humble, in reference to His manhood. <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> then subjoins the following words:—On reading these your sacred expressions, we find that we ourselves hold the same opinion: for there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism. We accordingly glorify God, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> of all, rejoicing mutually, because both our churches and yours hold a faith which is in accordance with the inspired scriptures, and the tradition of our holy fathers. <br />After the reading of these epistles, the members of the synod exclaimed in these words: </p>                        </div>

Again, when the bishops of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a> had expressed their hesitation at the following passage of the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>:—For there operates in each form its peculiar property, in union with what belongs to the other; the Word working that which pertains to the Word, and the body discharging that which pertains to the body; and the one shines forth by the miracles, the other was subjected to the insults; upon this the said <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> read a passage of <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> as follows:—The rest of the expressions are especially appropriate to deity; others, again, are equally suited to manhood; and some hold, as it were, an intermediate place, presenting the Son of God as being God and man at the same time. Afterwards, when the same bishops hesitated at another part of the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, which is as follows:—Although in our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> there is altogether one person, of God and man, yet the one part from which was derived to the other a community of ignominy, is distinct from that from which proceeded a community of glory; for from us was derived the manhood, which is inferior to the Father, and from the Father the Godhead, which partakes equality with the Father; Theodoret said, to adjust the point, that the blessed <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> had also expressed himself thus:— </p>                        </div>

He also prayed that they might have the epistle which was addressed by <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> to Nestorius, in which he exhorts him to assent to his twelve chapters. All expressed their concurrence in these requests; and when the magistrates had ruled that a respite of five days should be allowed, in order to their assembling with <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, all the bishops signified their approval, saying, Thus do we believe, thus do we all believe. Not one of us hesitates. We have all subscribed.

At this stage of the proceedings the members of the synod exclaimed: We all concur: we all approve: we all believe alike: we all hold the same sentiments: thus do we all believe. The fathers to the synod! the subscribers to the synod! Many be the years of the emperor! Many be the years of <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a>! The fathers to the synod: those who agree with us in faith, to the synod! Many be the years of the emperor! Those who agree with us in opinion, to the synod! Many be the years of the emperor! We have all subscribed. As <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> thinks, so do we. An interlocution was then pronounced to the following effect. We have referred these matters to our most sacred and pious lord, and are now waiting the answer of his piety. But your reverence will give account to God concerning <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, who has been deposed by you without the knowledge of our most sacred sovereign and ourselves, and concerning the five for whom you are now making entreaty, and concerning all the acts of the synod. They then expressed their approval, saying, God has deposed <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>; <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> has been justly deposed. <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> has deposed <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>. Afterwards, on the presentation of a response from <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>, leaving the case of those who had been deposed to the decision of the bishops, as the interlocution of the magistrates had set forth; they made entreaty in the following words. We pray that they may be admitted:—our fellows in doctrine, to the synod: our fellows in opinion, to the synod: the subscribers to the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, to the synod. They were accordingly, by an interlocution to that effect, numbered with the members of the synod. <br />Then were read the petitions presented from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> diocese to the emperor <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a>; which, in addition to other matters, contain the following. We agree in opinion with what the three hundred and eighteen fathers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>, and the blessed <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, and the sainted <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a> have set forth anathematising every heresy, both those of <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>, of <a href=/people/2741 target=_blank>Eunomius</a>, of <a href=/people/12062 target=_blank>Manes</a>, of Nestorius, and that of those who say, that the flesh of our Lord was derived from heaven and not from the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, in like manner with ourselves, with the exception of sin. Upon this, the whole synod exclaimed: Why have they not anathematised the doctrine of <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>? Let them subscribe the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, anathematising <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> and his doctrines. Let them concur with the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>. They intend to jeer us, and be gone. In reply, the bishops from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> stated, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> bishops were numerous, </p>                        </div>

After many intreaties on this subject, which were stoutly resisted by the synod, it was ruled, that a respite should be granted to the bishops from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, until their archbishop should be ordained. <br />Then petitions were presented from certain monks; the purport of which was, that they should not be compelled to subscribe certain papers, before the synod which the emperor hud summoned should have assembled, and its determinations be made known. After these had been read, <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, stated that Barsumas, one of the persons present, had been the murderer of Flavian, for he had exclaimed Slay him! and, though not a party to the petition, had improperly obtained admission. Upon this all the bishops exclaimed: Barsumas has desolated all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>; he has let loose upon us a thousand monks. After an interlocution, to the effect that the assembled monks should await the determination of the synod, they demanded that the libelli which they had drawn up, should be read; one requisition therein contained being, that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> and the bishops of his party should be present in the synod. In reply to which all the bishops exclaimed: Anathema to <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>. <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> has deposed <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>! Cast out such persons. Away with outrage; away with violence from the synod! Our words to the emperor! Away with outrage; away with infamy from the synod! After a repetition of these exclamations, it was ruled that the remainder of the libelli should be read: wherein it was affirmed, that the deposition of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> was improper; that, when a matter of faith was before the council, he ought to share in its deliberations, and that, if this were not granted, they would shake their garments from the communion of the assembled bishops. In reference to these expressions, <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, the archdeacon, read a canon against those who separate themselves. Again, when, at the questions of the most holy bishops, the monks manifested disagreement, and afterwards at an interrogation put by <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a> in the name of the synod, some anathematised Nestorius and <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, while others declined; it was ruled by the magistrates, that the petitions of <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> and the other monks should be read: which prayed the emperor no longer to sanction the monks who had lately opposed the orthodox doctrines. Whereupon <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, a monk, termed <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> orthodox: in reply to whom various doctrinal points were started by the magistrates. <br />At the fifth meeting, the magistrates ruled that the determinations relating to the faith should be published; and <a href=/people/625 target=_blank>Asclepiades</a>, a deacon of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, read a formulary, which it was resolved should not be inserted in the acts. Some dissented from it, but the majority approved it: and on the utterance of counter exclamations, the magistrates said, that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> affirmed that he had deposed Flavian on his asserting two natures, whereas the formulary contained the expression from two natures. To this <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> replied, that <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> had not been deposed on a point of faith, but because he had excommunicated <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>, and, after having been thrice summoned, did not appear. The magistrates then required that the substance of the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a> should be inserted in the formulary; but since the bishops objected, and maintained that no other formulary could be framed, inasmuch as a complete one already existed, a relation was made to the emperor; who commanded that six of the Oriental bishops, </p>                        </div>

Our Lord and <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and so forth, as it has been inserted in a previous part of the history. When all had exclaimed, This is the faith of the fathers: let the metropolitans at once subscribe! This is the faith of the Apostles: by this are we all guided: thus do we all think! the magistrates ruled, that the formulary, thus framed by the fathers and approved by all, should be referred to the imperial supremacy. <br />At the sixth meeting <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> was present, and harangued the bishops on the subject of unanimity. At the command of the emperor, the formulary was read by <a href=/people/3753 target=_blank>Aetius</a>, archdeacon of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, and all subscribed it. The emperor then asked, whether the formulary had been composed with the approbation of all: upon which all declared their confirmation of it by expressions of approval. Again the emperor twice addressed them, and all applauded. At the emperor's suggestion certain canons were enacted, and metropolitan rank was conferred upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>. The emperor further commanded the bishops to remain three or four days; that each one should move the synod on whatever matters he might choose, in the presence of the magistrates; and such as were judged proper, should take effect. The meeting was then closed. <br />Another was held, at which canons were enacted; and at the next, Juvenalis and <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> came to an agreement that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> should have for its province the two Phoenicias and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>; and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, the three Palestines; which was ratified by an interlocution of the magistrates and bishops. <br />At the ninth meeting, the case of Theodoret was mooted. He anathematised Nestorius, saying, Anathema to Nestorius, and to him who does not affirm the holy Virgin Mary to be Mother of God, and to him who divides into two Sons the one Son, the only begotten! I have also subscribed the formulary of faith and the epistle of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>. Upon this he was restored to his see, by an interlocution of all parties. <br />At another meeting, the case of Ibas was discussed; and the judgment was read which had been passed upon him by <a href=/people/6809 target=_blank>Photius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and <a href=/people/3024 target=_blank>Eustathius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=person long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>; but the vote was deferred to the next meeting. <br />At the eleventh meeting, when the majority of the bishops had voted that Ibas should be restored to his episcopal rank, others, in rejoinder, said that his accusers were waiting outside, and required that they should be admitted.

And further on: Let it therefore be your pleasure, that nothing be put forward otherwise than as accords with your sacred circular, being assured that, as we have before said, the whole world will be turned upside down, and the evils which have proceeded from the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> will be found trifling in comparison, notwithstanding the innumerable slaughters which they have caused, and the blood of the orthodox which they have unjustly and lawlessly shed.

So long as our great God and <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, who was incarnate and born of Mary, the Holy Virgin, and Mother of God, approves and readily accepts our concordant glorification and service, the power of our enemies will be crushed and swept away, and peace with its blessings, kindly temperature, abundant produce, and whatever is beneficial to man, will be liberally bestowed. Since, then, the irreprehensible faith is the preserver both of ourselves and the Roman weal, petitions have been offered to us from pious archimandrites and hermits, and other venerable persons, imploring us with tears that unity should be procured for the churches, and the limbs should be knit together, which the enemy of all good has of old time been eagerly bent upon severing, under a consciousness that defeat will befall him whenever he assails the body while in an entire condition. For since it happens, that of the unnumbered generations which during the lapse of so many years time has withdrawn from life, some have departed, deprived of the laver of regeneration, and others have been borne away on the inevitable journey of man, without having partaken in the divine communion; and innumerable murders have also been perpetrated; and not only the earth, but the very air has been defiled by a multitude of blood-sheddings; that this state of things might be transformed into good, who would not pray? For this reason, we were anxious that you should be informed, that we and the churches in every quarter neither have held, nor do we or shall we hold, nor are we aware of persons who hold, any other symbol or lesson or definition of faith or creed than the before-mentioned holy symbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers, which the aforesaid hundred and fifty holy fathers confirmed; and if any person does hold such, we deem him an alien: for we are confident that this symbol alone is, as we said, the preserver of our sovereignty, and on their reception of this alone are all the people baptised when desirous of the saving illumination: which symbol all the holy fathers assembled at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> also followed; who further passed sentence of deposition on the impious Nestorius and those who subsequently held his sentiments: which Nestorius we also anathematise, together with <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> and all who entertain opinions contrary to those above-mentioned, receiving at the same time the twelve chapters of <a href=/people/4133 target=_blank>Cyril</a>, of holy memory, formerly archbishop of the holy Catholic church of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a>. We moreover confess, that the only begotten Son of God, himself God, who truly assumed manhood, namely, our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, who is con-substantial with the Father in respect of the Godhead, and con-substantial with ourselves as respects the manhood; that He, having descended, and become incarnate of the Holy Spirit and Mary, the Virgin and Mother of God, is one and not two; for we affirm that both his miracles, and the sufferings which he voluntarily endured in the flesh, are those of a single person: for we do in no degree admit those who either make a division or a confusion, or introduce a phantom; inasmuch as his truly sinless incarnation from the Mother of God did not produce an addition of a son, because the Trinity continued a Trinity even when one member of the Trinity, the God Word, became incarnate. Knowing, then, that neither the holy orthodox churches of God in all parts, nor the priests, highly beloved of God, who are at their head, nor our own sovereignty, have allowed or do allow any other symbol or definition of faith than the before-mentioned holy lesson, we have united ourselves thereto without hesitation. And these things we write not as setting forth a new form of faith, but for your assurance: and every one who has held or holds any other opinion, either at the present or another time, whether at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> or in any synod whatever, we anathematise; and specially the before-mentioned Nestorius and <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, and those who maintain their doctrines. Link yourselves, therefore, to the spiritual mother, the church, and in her enjoy the same communion with us, according to the aforesaid one and only definition of the faith, namely, that of the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers. For your all holy mother, the church, waits to embrace you as true children, and longs to hear your loved voice, so long withheld. Speed yourselves, therefore, for by so doing you will both draw towards yourselves the favor of our Master and <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a> and God, Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and be commended by our sovereignty. <br />When this had been read, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> united themselves to the holy catholic and apostolic church. </p>                        </div>

The news of this circumstance greatly troubled <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, and induced him to send persons to gain information on the subject; when Peter, to convince them that he had not so acted, drew up memorials, in which certain persons said, from their own knowledge, that Peter had not done any thing of the kind. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, while increasing in your endeavours to guide all aright, you have united the holy church of God, by convincing us by the most powerful proofs that nothing at variance with this was enacted in the holy and general synod held at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, but that it accorded with the acts of the holy fathers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>, and confirmed them. Thus, having discovered no novelty therein, we have of our own free motion accorded our assent and belief. But we are informed that certain monks, envying our brotherly union, have conveyed certain slanders to your holy ears, which have with some difficulty succeeded in embittering the feelings of your holiness. And, in the first place, it is alleged that we have removed to another place the remains of our sainted father, the blessed archbishop <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, a thing abhorrent to religion and law: and they have further shifted their ground to another charge, in itself incoherent and worse than the former; for how could we possibly have anathematised the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, which we had previously confirmed by according to it our belief? But the malignant temper and fickleness of our people are notorious, and cannot but be known to your piety, as well as of those monks who are disposed to innovation; who, in conspiracy with certain ill-designing persons that have broken loose from the church, are endeavouring to draw away the people. Through your prayers we have also devised a discourse of a directly healing tendency, and in no way impugning the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, well knowing that its transactions contain no novelty; and, further, for the satisfaction of guileless persons, we have procured those who had united themselves to us, to affirm this point. This mischief, then, by much exertion, I have readily checked: but I make known to your holiness, that even still the monks who are ever sowing the tares, are not at rest, associating also with themselves, as instruments, persons who were never the inmates of monasteries; but they travel about disseminating various rumours to our disadvantage, and, while they do not allow that we act canonically and in a manner suitable to the holy catholic church of God, but are habituating our people to govern rather than obey us, they are bent on doing whatever is unbecoming the service of God. We doubt not, however, that your holiness will inform the most sacred master of the world of all these circumstances, and provide that a formulary shall be put forth by his serenity, embracing the necessary matters relating to such a peace of the church as becomes both God and the emperor; so as to lead all to repose on its provisions. </p>                        </div>

He expressly charged <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a> and Vitalis with holding communion with the heretics, by distinctly uttering the name of Peter in the reading of the sacred diptychs; and affirmed that many simple persons had, on this ground, been beguiled by the heretics, who said that Peter was admitted to the communion even of the Roman see: and, further, in reply to various interrogatories, <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> said that <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a> and his party had declined to have communication with any orthodox person, either in person or by letter, or to sift any of the presumptuous attempts upon the right faith.

On these grounds <a href=/people/5795 target=_blank>Misenus</a> and Vitalis were removed from the priesthood and severed from the holy communion, when a unanimous vote was passed by the synod, in the following terms: The church of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> does not admit Peter, the heretic, who has also been long ago condemned by the holy see, excommunicated, and anathematised. To whom, if there were no other objection, this is sufficient, namely, that having been ordained by heretics, he could not have authority over the orthodox. The decree also contains what follows: The mere circumstance shews <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, to have incurred very great responsibility, because, writing to <a href=/people/3251 target=_blank>Simplicius</a> and having termed Peter a heretic, he has nevertheless made no such declaration to the emperor: which was his duty, if he were loyal to him.

'Unless,' said he, 'thou shalt anathematise all these, as holding the opinions of Nestorius, thou art thyself a Nestorian, though thou shouldest ten thousand times anathematise him and his notion.' He also endeavoured by letters to induce the advocates of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a> and <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a> to take arms with him against Flavian, not however with a view of exacting from him an anathema upon the synod, but merely on the before-mentioned persons. But when the bishop Flavian had maintained a prolonged resistance to them, and other persons had united with Xenaias against him, namely, <a href=/people/7634 target=_blank>Eleusinus</a>, a bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> <a href=/people/8294 target=_blank>Secunda</a>, <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nicias</a>, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355358PLao class=place long=35.7849 lat=35.52>Laodicea</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and others from other quarters, the motive of whose spite against Flavian it is the province of others, not of ourselves, to detail; at last, in hope of peace, he yielded to their contentious spirit, and having in writing anathematised the before-mentioned persons, he despatched the instrument to the emperor, for they had stirred up him also against Flavian as a maintainer of the opinions of Nestorius. Xenaias, not contented with this, again demands of Flavian that he should anathematise the synod itself, and those who maintained two natures in the person of the Lord, namely, the flesh and the Godhead; and on his refusal, again accused him of being a Nestorian. After much stir upon this subject, and after the patriarch had put forth an exposition of faith, in which he confessed that he admitted the synod as far as regards the deposition of Nestorius and <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, not however as defining and teaching the faith; they again impugn him as secretly holding the opinions of Nestorius, unless he would further anathematise the synod itself, and those who maintained two natures in the person of the Lord, the flesh and the Godhead.

At the same time they also demanded of the bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> a written statement of faith; which he put forth, and sent to the emperor by the hands of the party of <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>.

For they have often forged discourses of the fathers, and to many writings of <a href=/people/943 target=_blank>Apollinaris</a> they have attached titles assigning them to <a href=/people/2291 target=_blank>Athanasius</a>, <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> <a href=/people/10377 target=_blank>Thaumaturgus</a>, and <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>; their principal object in so doing being to draw over the multitude to their own impieties. They also demanded of Macedonius a written statement of faith; who put one forth, affirming that he recognised only the creed of the three hundred and eighteen, and of the one hundred and fifty fathers, anathematising at the same time Nestorius, <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>, and those who held the doctrine of two sons or two Christs, or divided the natures; making, however, no mention of the synod of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, which deposed Nestorius, nor that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, which deposed <a href=/people/5387 target=_blank>Eutyches</a>. Indignant at this, the monastic bodies about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a> separate from their bishop Macedonius. In the mean time Xenaias and <a href=/people/9276 target=_blank>Dioscorus</a>, associating with them many of the bishops, became insufferable, from the stir which they raised against those who refused to anathematise; and, by various devices, they endeavoured to procure the banishment of those who persisted in their refusal. In this way, accordingly, they banish both Macedonius, find John, bishop of Paltus, and Flavian. Such are the contents of the letter. </p>                        </div>

For when <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a> was desirous of investing him with the purple, <a href=/people/5005 target=_blank>Euphemius</a>, who held the archiepiscopal see, withheld his approval, until <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> had presented to him an agreement, written with his own hand, and secured with fearful oaths, that he would maintain the faith inviolate, and introduce no innovation into the holy church of God, in case he should obtain the sceptre: which document he also deposited with Macedonius, the keeper of the sacred treasures. This measure he adopted, because <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> had generally the reputation of holding the Manichaean doctrine. When, however, Macedonius ascended the episcopal throne, <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> was desirous that the agreement should be returned to him, affirming it to be an insult to the imperial dignity, if the before-mentioned document, in his own hand-writing, should be preserved: and when Macedonius resolutely opposed the demand, and firmly protested that he would not betray the faith, the emperor pursued every insidious device for the purpose of ejecting him from his see. Accordingly, even boys were brought forward as informers, who falsely accused both themselves and Macedonius of infamous practices. But when Macedonius was found to be emasculate, they had recourse to other contrivances; until, by the advice of <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a>, commander of the household troops, he secretly retired from his see. <br />With the ejection of Flavian, other circumstances are associated. For we have met with some very aged men who remembered all the events of this time. These say, that the monks of the district called Cynegica, and of the whole of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> Prima, having been wrought upon by Xenaias, who was bishop of the neighbouring city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365379UHie class=place long=37.9477 lat=36.527>Hierapolis</a>, and who was named in Greek <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, rushed into the city in a body with great noise and tumult, endeavouring to compel Flavian to anathematise the synod of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a> and the tome of <a href=/people/1049 target=_blank>Leo</a>. Roused at the indignation manifested by Flavian, and the violent urgency of the monks, the people of the city made a great slaughter of them, so that a very large number found a grave in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361360WOro class=place long=35.9902 lat=36.0677>Orontes</a>, where the waves performed their only funeral rites. There happened also another circumstance of scarcely less magnitude than the former. For the monks of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a>, now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> <a href=/people/8294 target=_blank>Secunda</a>, from sympathy with Flavian, since he had led a monastic life in a monastery of the district called Tilmognon, advanced to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, with the intention of defending him. From which circumstance, also, no inconsiderable mischief arose. Accordingly, on the ground either of the former or latter occurrence, or both, Flavian is ejected, and condemned to reside at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/303254UPet class=place long=35.4423 lat=30.3285>Petra</a>, on the extreme verge of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>. </p>                        </div>

Thence he proceeds to the imperial city, to plead the cause of himself and those who had been expelled with him, and thus obtains the notice of the emperor <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, as is narrated by the author of the life of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>. <br />Accordingly, <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, in issuing synodical letters, expressly anathematised the synod at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>; on which point the letters addressed to Alcison speak as follows.

Such was the situation of matters in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320350RPal class=place long=35.0001 lat=32.0206>Palestine</a>. But of the bishops subject to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, some were carried away into compliance, among whom was <a href=/people/1842 target=_blank>Marinus</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>; others by force and compulsion concurred in the synodical letters of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, which included an anathema, both on the synod and all others who affirmed two natures or persons in the Lord, namely, the flesh and the Godhead; and others, after having concurred by compulsion, recalled their assent, and among them the bishops subject to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=place long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apamea</a>; others, again, altogether refused concurrence, among whom were <a href=/people/12208 target=_blank>Julian</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325365UBos class=place long=36.4817 lat=32.5177>Bostra</a>, <a href=/people/3592 target=_blank>Epiphanius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=person long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and some others, as is said. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=demonym long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isaurian</a> bishops, having returned to their sober senses, are now condemning themselves for the error into which they had been beguiled, and are anathematising <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> and his party. Others of the bishops and clergy subject to <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> have abandoned their churches, and among them <a href=/people/12208 target=_blank>Julian</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325365UBos class=person long=36.4817 lat=32.5177>Bostra</a>, and Peter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, who are now living in these parts, as also Manias.

Cosmas, bishop of my native place, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351367UEpi class=place long=36.7493 lat=35.1364>Epiphanea</a>, which stands on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361360WOro class=place long=35.9902 lat=36.0677>Orontes</a>, and Severian, bishop of the neighbouring city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349357UAre class=place long=36.7447 lat=34.9353>Arethusa</a>, being troubled at the synodical letters of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, and having withdrawn from his communion, despatched an instrument of deposition to him, while still bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>.

Letting his vail fall down to his breast, with wailing and deep drawn lamentation he presents to <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, as he advanced, the instruments of deposition in the guise of a petition: he then passes unobserved from among the attendant crowd and purchased safety by flight, before <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> had learned the purport of the document. <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, having received the document and learned its contents, continued, nevertheless, in his see, until the death of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>. <br />On being informed of these transactions, for I must record the benevolent measure of <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, he directs Asiaticus, who was commander in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> Libanensis, to eject Cosmas and Severian from their sees, because they had sent the instrument of deposition to <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>.

The impious and accursed revenue raised from this source, the collectors paid at the end of every five years into the hands of the first and most dignified of the prefects: so that it formed no unimportant part of the functions of that office, and had its separate exchequer, and accountants, men who regarded the business as a military service, suited, like the rest, to persons of some distinction. <br /><a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a>, being informed of the circumstance, laid the matter before the senate, and justly declaring it to be an abomination and unparallelled defilement, decreed that it should be utterly abolished; and committed to the flames the papers which were vouchers for its collection. With the desire also of making this measure a complete sacrifice to God, and of preventing any of his successors from reviving the ancient shame, he puts on the appearance of vexation, and accuses himself of inconsiderateness and excessive folly, saying, that in the too eager pursuit of novelty he had neglected the interests of the commonwealth, and had rashly and thoughtlessly abolished so important a revenue, which had been established in former times and confirmed by so long a continuance, </p>                        </div>

And while they, on their part, lamented the abolition of the levy, not in semblance but in reality, on account of the unrighteous gain which had thence accrued to them, and were professing the same perplexity as the emperor, he urged and exhorted them to employ every mode of search, in the endeavour to procure from among documents preserved in various quarters, a statement of the entire levy. Supplying each individual with money, he despatched him to collect materials, enjoining him to bring every paper which threw light upon this matter wherever it might be found; that by means of the utmost circumspection and minute attention, a statement of the business might be again put together.

The populace, having found in the house of <a href=/people/1842 target=_blank>Marinus</a> the Syrian, a monk from the country, cut off his head, saying that the clause had been added at his instigation; and having fixed it upon a pole, jeeringly exclaimed: See the plotter against the Trinity! <br />Such was the violence of the tumult, filling every quarter with devastation, and surpassing every means of control, that the emperor was driven to appear at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362BHiA class=place long=36.1717 lat=36.2269>Hippodrome</a> in pitiable guise, without his crown, and despatched heralds to proclaim to the assembled people, that he was most ready to resign his sovereignty; at the same time reminding them, that it was impossible that all should be elevated to that dignity, which admitted not of a plurality of occupants, and that one individual only could be his successor. <br />At this the temper of the people was suddenly changed, as by some divine impulse; and they begged <a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> to resume his crown; with a promise of peaceable conduct in future. <br /><a href=/people/1691 target=_blank>Anastasius</a> survived this event a very short time, and departed to the other world after a reign of twenty-seven years, three months, and three days. </p>                        </div>

He, by means both of abstinence and use of food, having attained to such a union with God as not only to discern forthcoming events, but also to possess the grace of perfect freedom from passion, was in company with a distinguished person from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, the capital of one of the Palestines. This was <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, a man of good family, accomplished, and high in dignities and whatever gives lustre to life. Zosimas, at the very moment of the overthrow of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, suddenly became troubled, uttered lamentations and deep sighs, and then shedding such a profusion of tears as to bedew the ground, called for a censer, and having fumed the whole place where they were standing, throws himself upon the ground, propitiating God with prayers and supplications. Upon <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> asking the reason of all this trouble, he distinctly replied, that the sound of the overthrow of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> was at that instant ringing in his ears. This led <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> and the rest of the astonished company to note down the hour; and they afterwards found that it was as Zosimas had said. <br />By his hand many other miracles were performed: but omitting the greater part of them, since they are too numerous to detail, I shall mention a few. <br />Contemporary with Zosimas, and endued with equal virtues, was a man named John, who had practised the endurance of the solitary and immaterial life in the cloister called Chuzibas, situated at the extremity of the glen at the northern part of the highway leading from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a>, and was now bishop of the before-named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>. This John, the Chuzibite, having heard that the wife of <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> had lost one of her eyes by a stroke of a spindle, runs immediately to her to see the accident; and when he finds that the pupil is gone and the eye altogether lacerated, he commands one of the physicians in attendance to bring a sponge, and, having replaced as well as he could the lacerated parts, to apply and secure the sponge with bandages. <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> was absent, for he happened to be with Zosimas in his monastery at Sinde, distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a> full five hundred stadia. Accordingly, messengers proceeded with all haste to <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, whom they found sitting in conversation with Zosimas. When informed of the circumstance, he uttered a piercing cry, tore his hair and cast it towards heaven. Upon Zosimas asking him the reason, he told him what had happened, interrupting his account with frequent wailings and tears. Whereupon Zosimas, leaving him alone, goes to his chamber, where he used to make his addresses to God according to the rule of such persons, and after some interval he approaches <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> with a solemnly joyous countenance, and gently pressing his hand, said: Depart with joy, depart. <a href=/people/1505 target=_blank>Grace</a> is given to the Chuzibite. Your wife is cured, and is in possession of both her eyes; for the accident has had no power to deprive her of them, since such was the desire of the Chuzibite. This was brought about by the united wonder-working of both the just men. <br />Again, as the same Zosimas was going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, and leading an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> laden with certain necessaries, a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> encountered him and carried off the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>. Zosimas follows into the wood, reaches the place where the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> was, satiated with his meal upon the beast, and smiling says, Come, my friend; my journey is interrupted, since I am heavy and far advanced in years, and not able to carry on my back the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s load. You must therefore carry it, though contrary to your nature, if you wish Zosimas to get out of this place and yourself to be a wild beast again. All at once the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, forgetting his ferocity, fawned on him, and by his gestures plainly manifested obedience. Zosimas then put the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>'s load upon him, and led him to the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, showing the power of God, and how all things are subservient to man if we live to Him and do not pervert the grace given to us. But that I may not render my history prolix by more circumstances of the kind, I will return to the point whence I digressed. </p>                        </div>

Four synods were thus proclaimed throughout the churches; first, that held at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>; secondly, that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>; thirdly, the former one at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>; and fourthly, that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=place long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>.

He states that Cabaones was chieftain of the Moors in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>. This Cabaones, he says--for it is worth while to use his own words during his able narration of this matter also--this Cabaones, as soon as he learned that the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> were marching against him, acted in the following manner. First, he commanded all his subjects to refrain from injustice and all luxurious food, but particularly from commerce with women; and having raised two fortified enclosures, he encamped himself with all the men in one, and enclosed the women in the other, threatening death to any man who should approach the women. Afterwards, he sent scouts to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> with these instructions: that when the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> on their march outraged any temple reverenced by the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, they should note what was being done, and when the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> left the place, should, immediately on their departure, treat the sanctuary in a manner directly the reverse. It is mentioned that he further said, that he was ignorant of the God worshipped by the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, but it was likely, if he were powerful, as was affirmed, that he would chastise those who outraged him, and defend such as rendered him service. The scouts, therefore, coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, continued to watch the preparations of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, and when the army set forward for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329132UOea class=place long=13.1758 lat=32.8999>Tripolis</a>, they followed it, disguised in a sorry dress. The <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, encamping at the close of the first day, introduced their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and other beasts into the temples of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and abstained from no species of outrage, but gave way to their usual license; and beating and severely scourging the priests whom they happened to seize, bid them wait upon them. But as soon as the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> had left the place, the scouts of Cabaones did all that had been enjoined them, and immediately cleansed the sanctuaries, sedulously removing the dung and every other defilement: they lighted all the tapers, paid reverent obeisance to the priests, and saluted them with every kindness; and when they had bestowed money on the beggars who sat round the shrine, they followed the army of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, who, from this point along the whole line of march, committed the same outrages, while the scouts remedied them. When, however, they were at no great distance, the scouts, proceeding in advance, announced to Cabaones all that had been done by the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a> and themselves to the temples of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and that the enemy were now near. On hearing this, he prepared to engage. By far the greater part of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, as our author states, were destroyed: some were captured by the enemy, and very few returned home. Such was the misfortune that Thrasamund sustained at the hands of the Moors.

Being determined by this circumstance, in the seventh year of his reign, he despatches <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, about the summer solstice, to attack <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>; on which occasion, when the general's ship touched at the shore of the palace, <a href=/people/3592 target=_blank>Epiphanius</a>, bishop of the city, offered up appropriate prayers, having previously baptized some of the soldiers and embarked them on board the vessel. He also narrates some circumstances, worthy of record, relating to the martyr Cyprian, in the following words: <br />All the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> especially reverence Cyprian, a holy man, and having erected on the shore, in front of their city, a noble shrine, besides other reverential observances, they celebrate an annual festival, and call it Cypriana; and the sailors are accustomed to call the tempestuous weather which I have before mentioned by the same name as the festival, since it is wont to happen at the time of the year at which the Africans have fixed its perpetual celebration. This temple the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>, in the reign of Huneric, took by force from the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and ignominiously expelling the priests, refitted it, as henceforward belonging to the Arians. They say that Cyprian, frequently appearing in a dream to the Africans who were indignant and distressed on this account, told them that there was no occasion for the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> to be solicitous about him, for in time he would avenge himself: which prediction attained its accomplishment in the time of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, ninety-five years after its loss, was reduced by him under the Roman power, by the utter overthrow of the <a href=/people/12167 target=_blank>Vandals</a>: at which time the doctrine of the Arians was entirely extirpated from Africa, and the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> recovered their own temples, according to the prediction of the martyr Cyprian. </p>                        </div>

She was the first person who led <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> to entertain a desire for the Gothic war, by sending an embassy to him on the formation of a conspiracy against herself. On the death, however, of Athalaric at a very early age, <a href=/people/12053 target=_blank>Theodatus</a>, a kinsman of Theodoric, was invested with the sovereignty of the West, but abdicated when <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> had despatched <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> to that quarter; being a person addicted rather to literature, and altogether wanting in military experience; while <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vitiges</a>, an able soldier, was in command of his forces. From the materials which the same <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> has collected, one may gather that <a href=/people/12051 target=_blank>Vitiges</a> abandoned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the arrival of <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; who at once marched upon the city. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> readily opened their gates to him; a result mainly brought about by Silverius, their bishop, who, with this view, had sent to him Fidelis, formerly assessor to Athalaric. They accordingly surrendered their city to him without resistance: and thus <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, after an interval of sixty years, again fell into Roman hands on the ninth day of the month <a href=/people/10782 target=_blank>Apellaios</a>, called by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> December.7 The same <a href=/people/852 target=_blank>Procopius</a> writes, that, when the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> were besieging <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/4894 target=_blank>Belisarius</a>, suspecting Silverius of a design to betray the city, transports him to Greece and appoints Vigilius in his room. </p>                        </div>

In the first place, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> sent ambassadors to <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> to induce him not to break the peace which was intended to be perpetual, nor to trespass on the existing conditions; proposing that the points in dispute should be discussed and settled in an amicable manner.

The historian also writes, that <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> captured and destroyed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359388USou class=place long=38.7797 lat=35.899>Sura</a>, a city on the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, after having professed to make terms, but dealing with it in defiance of all justice, by paying no regard to the conditions, and becoming master of it rather by stratagem than by open war.

When the sons of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=ethnic long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apameans</a> were informed that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> had been burnt, they besought the before-mentioned <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a> to bring forth and display the saving and life-giving wood of the cross, in deviation from established rule; that they might behold and kiss for the last time the sole salvation of man, and obtain a provision for the passage to another life, in having the precious cross as their means of transport to the better lot. In performance of which request, <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a> brings forth the life-giving wood, announcing stated days for its display, that all the neighbouring people might have an opportunity to assemble and enjoy the salvation thence proceeding. <br />Accordingly, my parents visited it together with the rest, accompanied by myself, at that time a school-boy. When, therefore, we requested permission to adore and kiss the precious cross, <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a>, lifting up both his hands, displayed the wood which blotted out the ancient curse, making an entire circuit of the sanctuary, as was customary on the ordinary days of adoration. As <a href=/people/6014 target=_blank>Thomas</a> moved from place to place, there followed him a large body of fire, blazing but not consuming; so that the whole spot where he stood to display the precious cross seemed to be in flames: and this took place not once or twice but often, as the priest was making the circuit of the place, and the assembled people were entreating him that it might be done. This circumstance foreshewed the preservation which was granted to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/354364PApa class=ethnic long=36.4017 lat=35.4195>Apameans</a>. Accordingly, a representation of it was suspended on the roof of the sanctuary, explaining it by its delineation to those who were uninformed: which was preserved until the irruption of Adaarmanes and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, when it was burnt together with the holy church in the conflagration of the entire city.

He then relates how <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> made a fresh movement to lay siege to the city, thinking to falsify the assertion prevalent among the faithful, that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371388UEde class=place long=38.7844 lat=37.1455>Edessa</a> would never fall into the power of an enemy: which assertion, however, is not contained in what was written to <a href=/people/4806 target=_blank>Abgarus</a> by <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> our God; as the studious may gather from the history of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> Pamphili, who cites the epistle verbatim. Such, however, is the averment and belief of the faithful; which was then realised, faith bringing about the accomplishment of the prediction. For after <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> had made many assaults on the city, had raised a mound of sufficient size to overtop the walls of the town, and had devised innumerable expedients beside, he raised the siege and retreated. I will, however, detail the particulars. <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> ordered his troops to collect a great quantity of wood for the siege from whatever timber fell in their way; and when this had been done before the order could well be issued, arranging it in a circular form, he threw a mound inside with its face advancing against the city. In this way elevating it gradually with the timber and earth, and pushing it forward towards the town, he raised it to a height sufficient to overtop the wall, so that the besiegers could hurl their missiles from vantage ground against the defenders. When the besiegers saw the mound approaching the walls like a moving mountain, and the enemy in expectation of stepping into the town at day-break, they devised to run a mine under the mound--which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> term aggestus--and by that means apply fire, so that the combustion of the timber might cause the downfall of the mound. The mine was completed; but they failed in attempting to fire the wood, because the fire, having no exit whence it could obtain a supply of air, was unable to take hold of it. In this state of utter perplexity, they bring the divinely wrought image, which the hands of men did not form, but <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> our God sent to <a href=/people/4806 target=_blank>Abgarus</a> on his desiring to see Him. Accordingly, having introduced this holy image into the mine, and washed it over with water, they sprinkled some upon the timber; and the divine power forthwith being present to the faith of those who had so done, the result was accomplished which had previously been impossible: for the timber immediately caught the flame, and being in an instant reduced to cinders, communicated with that above, and the fire spread in all directions. When the besieged saw the smoke rising, they adopted the following contrivance. Having filled small jars with sulphur, tow, and other combustibles, they threw them upon the aggestus; and these, sending forth srnoke as the fire was increased by the force of their flight, prevented that which was rising from the mound from being observed; so that all who were not in the secret, supposed that the smoke proceeded solely from the jars. On the third day the flames were seen issuing from the earth, and then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> on the mound became aware of their unfortunate situation. But <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, as if in opposition to the power of heaven, endeavoured to extinguish the pile, by turning all the water-courses which were outside the city upon it. The fire, however, receiving the water as if it had been oil or sulphur, or some other combustible, continually increased, until it had completely levelled the entire mound and reduced the aggestus to ashes. Then <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, in utter despair, impressed by the circumstances with a sense of his disgraceful folly in having entertained an idea of prevailing over the God whom we worship, retreated ingloriously into his own territories. </p>                        </div>

When they had been duly conveyed, <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> asked the priest and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> who had been sent with him, whether there was not any thing besides. Upon this one of them, being persons unaccustomed to speak the truth, told <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> that there were some other treasures concealed by the townsmen, who were but few. In fact, there had been left behind not any treasure of gold or silver, but one of more valuable material, and irrevocably devoted to God, namely, the holy relics of the victorious martyr <a href=/people/1338 target=_blank>Sergius</a>, lying in a coffin of the oblong sort, plated over with silver. <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, influenced by these persons, advanced his whole army against the city; when suddenly there appeared along the circuit of the walls, in defence of the place, innumerable shields; on seeing which the persons sent by <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> returned, describing, with wonder, the number and fashion of the arms. And when, on further enquiry, he learned that very few persons remained in the city, and these consisted of aged people and children, from the absence of the flower of the population, he perceived that the prodigy proceeded from the martyr, and, influenced by fear and wonder at the faith of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, he withdrew into his own country.

Two years after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, a pestilence broke out, in some respects similar to that described by <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, in others widely different. It took its rise from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Aethiopia</a>, as is now reported, and made a circuit of the whole world in succession, leaving, as I suppose, no part of the human race unvisited by the disease. Some cities were so severely afflicted as to be altogether depopulated, though in other places the visitation was less violent. It neither commenced according to any fixed period, nor was the time of its cessation uniform; but it seized upon some places at the commencement of winter, others in the course of the spring, others during the summer, and in some cases, when the autumn was advanced. In some instances, having infected a part of a city, it left the remainder untouched; and frequently in an uninfected city one might remark a few households excessively wasted; and in several places, while one or two households utterly perished, the rest of the city remained unvisited: but, as we have learned from careful observation, the uninfected households alone suffered the succeeding year. But the most singular circumstance of all was this; that if it happened that any inhabitants of an infected city were living in a place which the calamity had not visited, these alone were seized with the disorder. This visitation also befell cities and other places in many instances according to the periods called Indictions; and the disease occurred, with the almost utter destruction of human beings, in the second year of each indiction. Thus it happened in my own case--for I deem it fitting, in due adaptation of circumstances, to insert also in this history matters relating to myself--that at the commencement of this calamity I was seized with what are termed buboes, while still a school-boy, and lost by its recurrence at different times several of my children, my wife, and many of my kin, as well as of my domestic and country servants; the several indictions making, as it were, a distribution of my misfortunes. Thus, not quite two years before my writing this, being now in the fifty-eighth year of my age, on its fourth visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, at the expiration of the fourth indiction from its commencement, I lost a daughter and her son, besides those who had died previously. The plague was a complication of diseases: for, in some cases, commencing in the head, and rendering the eyes bloody and the face swollen, it descended into the throat, and then destroyed the patient. In others, there was a flux of the bowels: in others buboes were formed, followed by violent fever; and the sufferers died at the end of two or three days, equally in possession, with the healthy, of their mental and bodily powers. Others died in a state of delirium, and some by the breaking out of carbuncles. Cases occurred where persons, who had been attacked once and twice and had recovered, died by a subsequent seizure. <br />The ways in which the disease; was communicated, were various and unaccountable: for some perished by merely living with the infected, others by only touching them, others by having entered their chamber, others by frequenting public places. Some, having fled from the infected cities, escaped themselves, but imparted the disease to the healthy. Some were altogether free from contagion, though they had associated with many who were afflicted, and had touched many not only in their sickness but also when dead. Some, too, who were desirous of death, on account of the utter loss of their children and friends, and with this view placed themselves as much as possible in contact with the diseased, were nevertheless not infected; as if the pestilence struggled against their purpose. This calamity has prevailed, as I have already said, to the present time, for two and fifty years, exceeding all that have preceded it. For <a href=/people/10068 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> expresses wonder that the pestilence which happened in his time, lasted for fifteen years. The sequel is uncertain, since its course will be guided by the good pleasure of God, who knows both the causes of things, and their tendencies. I shall now return to the point from which I digressed, and relate the remainder of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>'s history. </p>                        </div>

He stripped of their entire property innumerable wealthy persons, under colour of the emptiest pretexts. If even a prostitute, marking out an individual as a victim, raised a charge of criminal intercourse against him, all law was at once rendered vain, and by making <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> her associate in dishonest gain, she transferred to herself the whole wealth of the accused person. At the same time he was liberal in expenditure; so far as to raise in every quarter many sacred and magnificent temples, and other religious edifices devoted to the care of infants and aged persons of either sex, and of such as were afflicted with various diseases. He also appropriated considerable revenues for carrying out these objects; and performed many such actions as are pious and acceptable to God, provided that those who perform them do so from their own means, and the offering of their deeds be pure. </p>                        </div>

Nevertheless I will endeavour to the best of my ability to detail the plan of the sacred precinct. The nave of the sanctuary is a dome, supported by four arches, and raised to so great a height that the sight of persons surveying it from below can scarcely reach the vertex of the hemisphere, and no one from above, however daring, ventures to bend over and look down to the floor. The arches are raised clear from the pavement to the roof: but within those on the right and left are ranged columns of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a> stone, which, together with other corresponding pillars, support galleries, so as to allow those who wish, to look down upon the performance of the rites below. From these the empress also, when attending at the festivals, witnesses the ceremony of the sacred mysteries. But the eastern and western arches are left vacant, without any thing to interrupt the imposing aspect of so vast dimensions. There are also colonnades under the before-mentioned galleries, forming, with pillars and small arches, a termination to so vast a structure. But in order to convey a more distinct idea of this wonderful fabric, I have thought proper to set down in feet, its length, breadth, and height, as well as the span and height of the arches, as follows:--The length from the door facing the sacred apse where are performed the rites of the bloodless sacrifice, to the apse, is one hundred and ninety feet: the breadth from north to south is one hundred and fifteen feet: the depth from the centre of the hemisphere to the floor is one hundred and eighty feet: the span of each of the arches is * * * feet: the length, however, from east to west is two hundred and sixty feet; and the range of the lights seventy-five feet. There are also to the west two other noble colonnades, and on all sides unroofed courts of elaborate beauty. <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> also erected the church of the holy Apostles, which may dispute the first place with any other. In this the emperors and the bishops are usually interred. I have thought fit thus to take some notice of these and similar matters. </p>                        </div>

It took its rise from the existence of the faction among the populace distinguished by the name Nica. He appeared to favour one party, namely the Blues, to such an excess, that they slaughtered their opponents at mid-day and in the middle of the city, and, so far from dreading punishment, were even rewarded; so that many persons became murderers from this cause. They were allowed to assault houses, to plunder the valuables they contained, and to compel persons to purchase their own lives; and if any of the authorities endeavoured to check them, he was in danger of his very life: and it actually happened that a person holding the government of the East, having chastised some of the rioters with lashes, was himself scourged in the very centre of the city, and carried about in triumph. <a href=/people/2600 target=_blank>Callinicus</a> also, the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, having subjected to legal punishment two <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=demonym long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilician</a> murderers, Paul and <a href=/people/5664 target=_blank>Faustinus</a>, who had assaulted and endeavoured to despatch him, suffered impalement, as the penalty for right feeling and maintenance of the laws. The members of the other faction having, in consequence, fled from their homes, and meeting with a welcome nowhere, but being universally scouted as a pollution, betook themselves to waylaying travellers, and committed thefts and murders to such an extent, that every place was filled with untimely deaths, robberies, and every other crime. Sometimes also, siding with the other faction, <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> put to death in turn their opponents, by surrendering to the vengeance of the laws those whom he had allowed to commit in the cities equal outrages with barbarians. Neither words nor time would suffice for a minute detail of these transactions. Thus much will, however, serve for a conception of the remainder. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> lived principally in solitude, affording to none the means of knowing how and when he propitiated the Deity, nor his time of abstinence or eating. Frequently, too, on the public roads, he seemed to be deprived of self-possession, and to become utterly void of sense and intelligence, and entering at times into a tavern, he would eat, when he happened to be hungry, whatever food was within his reach. But if any one saluted him with an inclination of the head, he would leave the place angrily and hastily, through reluctance that his peculiar virtues should be detected by many persons. Such was the conduct of <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> in public. <br />But there were some of his acquaintances, with whom he associated without any assumed appearances. One of his friends had a female domestic, who, having been debauched and become pregnant by some person, when she was urged by her owners to name the individual, said that <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> had secretly cohabited with her and that she was pregnant by him; that she was ready to swear to the truth of this statement, and, if necessary, to convict him. On hearing this, <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> assented, saying that he bore the flesh with its frailties; and when the story was universally spread, and <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>, as it seemed, was deeply disgraced, he withdrew into retirement, as if from feelings of shame. When the woman's time had arrived, and she had been placed in the usual position, her throes, causing great and intolerable sufferings, brought her into imminent peril, but the birth made no progress. When, accordingly, they besought <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>, who had come thither designedly, to pray for her, he openly declared that the woman would not be delivered before she had said who was the father of the child: and when she had done this, and named the real father, the delivery was instantaneous, as though by the midwifery of truth. <br />He once was seen to enter the chamber of a courtezan, and having closed the door, he remained alone with her a considerable time; and when, again opening it, he went away looking round on all sides lest any one should see him, suspicion rose to so high a pitch, that those who witnessed it, brought out the woman, and inquired what was the nature of <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a>'s visit to her and continuance with her for so long a time. She swore that, from want of necessaries, she had tasted nothing but water for three days past, and that <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> had brought her victuals and a vessel of wine; that, having closed the door, he set a table before her and bid her make a meal, and satisfy her hunger, after her sufferings from want of food. She then produced the remains of what had been set before her. <br />Also at the approach of the earthquake which visited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a> <a href=/people/9749 target=_blank>Maritima</a>, and by which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/341356PByb class=place long=35.646 lat=34.119>Byblus</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/344358UTri class=place long=35.812 lat=34.449>Tripolis</a> especially suffered, raising a whip in his hand, he struck the greater part of the columns in the forum, exclaiming, Stand still, if there shall be occasion to dance.

They deposited his body in the tomb appropriated to strangers: but, after the subsequent interment of two others, his body was found above them, an extraordinary wonder, proceeding from God, who bore testimony to him even after his death; for the other bodies were thrown to a considerable distance. They report the circumstance to Ephraemius, in admiration of the saint. In consequence, his holy body is transported to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, with a public festival and procession, and is honoured with a place in the cemetery, having, by its translation, stopped the plague which was then visiting the place. The yearly festival in honour of whom the sons of the Antiochenes continue to celebrate to our time with great magnificence.

On one occasion of this kind, there was included among them the son of a glass-worker, a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> by faith; who, in reply to the inquiries of his parents respecting the cause of his delay, told them what had taken place, and what he had eaten in company with the other boys.

The mother, unable to find her child, wandered over the city with lamentations and wailings; and on the third day, standing by the door of her husband's workshop, was calling upon the boy by name, tearing herself in her sorrow. He, recognising his mother's voice, answered her from within the furnace, and she, bursting open the doors, saw, on her entrance, the boy standing in the midst of the coals, and untouched by the fire. On being asked how he had continued unhurt, he said that a woman in a purple robe had frequently visited him that; she had offered him water, and with it had quenched that part of the coals which was nearest to him; and that she had supplied him with food as often as he was hungry. <br /><a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>, on the report of this occurrence, placed the boy and his mother in the orders of the church, after they had been enlightened by the laver of regeneration.

In the same terms he replied to a question of the monastic body of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> Prima and <a href=/people/8294 target=_blank>Secunda</a>, confirming the minds of all, preparing them for the struggle, and daily reading in the Church those words of the chosen vessel:15 If any one is preaching to you a gospel different from that which ye have received, even though it be an angel from heaven, let him be accursed. 16 To this all, with few exceptions, paid a steady regard and zealous adherence. He also addressed to the Antiochenes a valedictory discourse, on hearing that <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> intended to banish him; a discourse deserving admiration for its elegance, its flow of thought, the abundance of sacred texts, and the appropriateness of its historical matters. </p>                        </div>

His nephew <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> succeeds to the purple; having previously held the office of guardian of the palace, styled in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> language Curopalata. No one, except those who were immediately about his person, was aware of the demise of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a> or the declaration of <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, until the latter made his appearance in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290BHip class=place long=28.976 lat=41.0065>hippodrome</a>, by way of formally assuming the stated functions of royalty. Confining himself to this simple proceeding, he then returned to the palace. <br />His first edict was one dismissing the bishops to their respective sees, wherever they might be assembled, with a provision that they should maintain what was already established in religion, and abstain from novelties in matters of faith. This proceeding was to his honour. In his mode of life, however, he was dissolute, utterly abandoned to luxury and inordinate pleasures: and to such a degree was he inflamed with desire for the property of others, as to convert every thing into a means of unlawful gain; standing in no awe of the Deity even in the case of bishoprics, but making them a matter of public sale to any purchasers that offered. Possessed, as he was, alike by the vices of audacity and cowardice, he in the first place sends for his kinsman <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, a man universally famous for military skill and his other distinctions, who was at that time stationed upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Danube</a>, and engaged in preventing the <a href=/people/5492 target=_blank>Avars</a> from crossing that river. <br />These were one of those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a> tribes who live in wagons, and inhabit the plains beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>.

For, since both of them had been possessed of equal dignity, and the succession to the empire was in suspense between both, they had agreed, after much dispute, that whichever of the two should become possessed of the sovereignty, should confer the second place on the other; so that while ranking beneath the emperor, he should still take precedence of all others. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore we also, following the evangelical precepts and the holy symbol or doctrine of the holy fathers, exhort all persons to unite in one and the same church and sentiment; and this we do, believing in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, holding the doctrine of a consubstantial Trinity, one Godhead or nature and substance, both in terms and reality; one power, influence, and operation in three subsistences or persons; into which doctrine we were baptized, in which we believe, and to which we have united ourselves. For we worship a Unity in trinity and a Trinity in unity, peculiar both in its division and in its union, being Unity in respect of substance or Godhead, and Trinity with regard to its proprieties or subsistences or persons; for it is divided indivisibly, so to speak, and is united divisibly: for there is one thing in three, namely, the Godhead; and the three things are one, namely, those in which is the Godhead, or, to speak more accurately, which are the Godhead: and we acknowledge the Father to be God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, whenever each person is regarded by itself----the thought in that case separating the things that are inseparable----and the three when viewed in conjunction to be God by sameness of motion and of nature; inasmuch as it is proper both to confess the one God, and at the same time to proclaim the three subsistences or proprieties.

The union according to subsistence signifies, that the God-Word, that is to say one subsistence of the three subsistences of the Godhead, was not united with a previously existing human being, but in the womb of our Lady, the holy glorious Mother of God and ever virgin Mary, formed for himself of her, in his own subsistence, flesh consubstantial with ourselves, having the same passions in all respects except sin, and animated with a reasonable and intelligent soul; for he retained his subsistence in himself, and became man, and is one and the same, our Lord Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, united in glorification with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

By dealing with matters with unfailing promptitude, according as either necessity required or opportunity favoured, he tilled with admiration not only the Roman but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> sovereigns, as I shall set forth the particulars in their proper place. His character was strongly marked by vehemence, and at times by indications of anger; while, on the other hand, his meekness and gentleness were not confined, but were exceedingly abundant; so that to him was admirably fitted the excellent expression of <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> Theologus, austerity tempered with modesty, while neither quality was impaired, but each rendered more striking by the other. </p>                        </div>

Information, however, that the siege was making no progress, but that the commander was bringing great discredit upon himself by attempting impossibilities in the case of so important a city with so contemptible a force, is conveyed in the first instance to <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Theopolis</a>: for the bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a>, being strongly attached to <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, as having received munificent presents from him, and especially being indignant at the insolence which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> were continually displaying towards the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and desirous that his city should be subject to the Roman power, supplied information to <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> of all things that were going on in the enemy's territory, at each several juncture. This the latter immediately forwarded to Jus tin, informing him as quickly as possible of the advance of <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>: but he, being immersed in his habitual pleasures, paid no regard to the letters of <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>; nor was he indeed inclined to believe them, indulging rather the thoughts suggested by his wishes: for the ordinary mark of dissolute persons is a meanness of spirit combined with confidence with regard to results; as well as incredulity, if any thing occurs which runs counter to their desires. Accordingly he writes to <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, altogether repudiating the information as being utterly false, and, even supposing it were true, saying that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> would not come up before the siege was concluded, and that, if they did, they would be beaten off with loss. He further sends <a href=/people/2703 target=_blank>Acacius</a>, a wicked and insolent man, to <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> with orders to supersede him in the command, even supposing he had already set one foot within the town. This command he strictly executed, carrying out the emperor's orders without any regard to the public good: for, on his arrival at the camp, he deprives <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcian</a> of his command while on the enemy's territory, and without informing the army of the transaction. The various officers, on learning at the break of the next clay that their commander was superseded, no longer appeared at the head of their troops, but stole away in various directions, and thus raised that ridiculous siege. <br />Adaarmanes, on the other hand, in command of a considerable force of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and Scenite barbarians, having marched by Circesium, inflicted every possible injury with fire and sword upon the Roman territory, setting no limits to his intentions or actions. He also captures many fortresses and towns, without encountering any resistance; in the first place, because there was no one in command, and secondly, because, since the Roman troops were shut up in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372410UDar class=place long=40.953 lat=37.1772>Daras</a> by <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, his foragings and incursions were made in perfect security. He also directed an advance upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Theopolis</a>, without proceeding thither in person. These troops were compelled to draw off most unexpectedly; for scarcely any one, or indeed very few persons, remained in the city; and the bishop had fled, taking with him the sacred treasures, because both the greater part of the walls had fallen to ruins, and the populace had made insurrection with the hope of gaining ascendancy by change: a thing of frequent occurrence, and especially at junctures like this. The insurgents themselves also abandoned the city, without any attempt to meet the emergency or take active measures against the enemy. </p>                        </div>

On the capitulation of the city from the inability of the inhabitants to offer any resistance, since the wall had fallen down through age, he fired and pillaged the whole place, in violation of the terms, and drew off, carrying away captive the inhabitants of the town and the adjoining country, and among them the bishop and the governor. He also exercised every kind of atrocity during his march, without meeting with any resistance or indeed attempt at opposition, except a very small force sent out by <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a> under the command of <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>, who had formerly been a banker at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PKon class=place long=28.978 lat=41.01>Constantinople</a>, and subsequently appointed steward of one of the imperial residences. These troops however fled with precipitation, and narrowly escaped being made prisoners. <br />After these operations, Adaarmanes joins <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, who had not yet captured the city he was besieging. By the junction, he threw an important weight into the scale, in raising the spirits of his countrymen, while he disheartened their opponents. He found the city cut off by lines, and a huge mound carried forward within a short distance of the walls, with engines mounted, and especially catapults, shooting from vantage ground. By these means, <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> took the city by storm. John, the son of <a href=/people/8433 target=_blank>Timostratus</a>, was governor, who paid little regard to the defence of the place, or perhaps betrayed it; for both accounts are reported. <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> had besieged the city for five months or more without any effort being made for its relief. Having brought forth all the inhabitants in immense numbers, some of whom he miserably slaughtered but retained the greater part as captives, he garrisoned the city, on account of its important situation, and then retired into his own territories. </p>                        </div>

He deemed wealth to consist in aiding all with largesses, not merely so far as to meet their wants, but even to superfluity: for he did not consider what the needy ought to receive, but what it became a Roman emperor to bestow. He esteemed that gold to be adulterated which was exacted with tears: on which account he entirely remitted the taxation for one year, and released from their imposts the properties which Adaarmanes had devastated, not merely to the extent of the damage but even far beyond it. The magistrates were also excused from the necessity of making the unlawful presents, by means of which the emperors formerly made a sale of their subjects.

In such contempt did <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> hold the Roman power, that, when the Caesar had sent an embassy to him, he did not deign to admit the ambassadors to an audience, but bid them follow him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387355UMaz class=place long=35.4881 lat=38.7207>Caesarea</a>; at which place he said he would take the embassy into his consideration.

The latter, having together with his troops made himself master of a great amount of money and spoil, and carrying off the beasts of burden with their loads, among which was the sacred fire of <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> to which divine honours were paid, makes a circuit of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> camp, singing songs of victory, and rejoins, about nightfall, his own army, who had already broken up from their position, without a commencement of battle on the part of either <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a> or themselves, beyond a few slight skirmishes or single combats, such as usually take place. <br /><a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>, having lighted many fires, made preparations for a night assault; and since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> had formed two camps, he attacks the division which lay northward, at the dead of night.

In this city he was pursuing his engagements, from which resulted an intimacy with <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, president of that Church, and frequent visits to him, partly for the purpose of conversing on matters of business, and partly with a view to obtain greater influence on the ground of his intercourse with the prelate. This person was detected in the practice of sacrificial rites, and being called to account was proved to be a miscreant and a sorcerer, and implicated in innumerable enormities. He gains over, however, by bribery, the governor of the East, and would have obtained an acquittal, together with his accomplices, for he was associated with others of a similar stamp who were involved in the detection, had not the people risen, and, by exciting a universal stir, frustrated the design. <br />They also clamoured against the bishop, saying that he was a party to the scheme; and some turbulent and malignant demon induced persons to believe that he had also taken part with <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> in the sacrificial rites. By this means <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> was brought into extreme danger, from the vehement efforts of the populace against him; and the suspicion was so far prevalent, that even the emperor <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was desirous of learning the truth from the mouth of <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>. Accordingly, he orders <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> and his associates to be conveyed forthwith to the imperial city. On learning this, <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> rushed to a certain image of the Mother of God, which was suspended by a cord in the prison, and folding his hands behind his back, announced himself as a suppliant: but she, in detestation and conviction of the guilty and God-hated man, turned herself quite round, presenting a prodigy awful and worthy of perpetual remembrance; which, having been witnessed by all the prisoners as well as by those who had the charge of <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> and his associates, was thus published to the world. She also appeared in a vision to some of the faithful, exhorting them against the wretch, and saying that <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> was guilty of insult against her Son. <br />When he had been conveyed to the imperial city, and, on being subjected to the extreme of torture, was unable to allege anything against the bishop, he and his associates were the cause of still greater disturbances and a general rising of the populace: for, when some of the party had received sentence of banishment instead of death, the populace, inflamed with a sort of divine zeal, caused a general commotion, in their fury and indignation, and having seized the persons condemned to banishment and put them into a skiff, they committed them alive to the flames; such being the people's verdict. They also clamoured against the emperor and their own bishop Eutychius as betrayers of the faith; and they would have inevitably despatched Eutychius, and those who had been charged with the investigation, making search for them in every quarter, had not all-preserving Providence rescued them from their pursuers, and gradually lulled the anger of so numerous a population; so that no outrage was perpetrated at their hands. <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> himself, after being first exposed to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre and mangled by them, was then impaled, without terminating even then his punishment in this world; for the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a>, tearing down his polluted body, divided it as a feast among themselves; a circumstance never before noticed. There was also one of my fellow-citizens, who, before these events took place, affirmed that he had been informed by a dream, that the judgment upon <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a> and his associates was in the hands of the populace. A person too of high distinction, being the curator of the palace, who had resolutely protected <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, said that he had seen the Mother of God, demanding of him how long he intended to defend <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, who had so grievously outraged herself and her Son.

Being staid and precise in his mode of living and manners, he was temperate in his food, using only such as was necessary and simple, and was superior to all other indulgences of a luxurious life. He was not easily accessible to the solicitations of the vulgar, nor a too easy listener in general; well knowing that the one tends to produce contempt, and the other leads to flattery. Accordingly, he granted audiences sparingly, and those only to persons on serious business, and closed his ears against idle talk, not with wax, as poets say, but rather with reason; so that this latter was an excellent key to them, appropriately both opening and closing them during conversation. So completely had he banished both ignorance, the mother of audacity, and also cowardice, which is at the same time a foreigner and a neighbour to the former, that with him to face danger was an act of prudence, and to decline it was a measure of safety; while both courage and discretion were the charioteers of opportunity, and guided the reins to whatever quarter necessity directed: so that his efforts were both restrained and put forth, as it were, by measure and rule. Concerning this person I shall speak more fully in the sequel; since the detail of his greatness and excellence I must reserve for the history of his reign; which displayed the man in a clearer light, as unfolding, through freedom of action, even the more inward parts of his character. <br />This Maurice, advancing beyond the limits of the empire, captures both cities and fortresses, of the greatest importance to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and carried off so much plunder, that the captives were sufficiently numerous to occupy at length whole islands, towns, and districts which had been deserted: and thus the land which had been previously untilled, was every where restored to cultivation. Numerous armies also were raised from among them, that fought resolutely and courageously against the other nations.

In attendance on the nuptials were Religion and Royalty, offering an escort most distinguished and gifts most precious. For the one supplied a father and mother, to hallow the rite with honoured locks of grey and venerable wrinkles— a circumstance strange in the story of sovereigns— as also brethren noble and blooming, to give dignity to the nuptial procession: the other, a gold embroidered robe, adorned with purple and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=demonym long=74 lat=30>Indian</a> gems, and crowns most costly, with abundance of gold and the varied emblazonment of jewels; together with the attendance of all who were distinguished in courtly rank or military service, lighting the nuptial flambeaux in splendid costumes and investitures, and hymning the bridal cavalcade: so that no human display was ever more majestic and happy. <a href=/people/2736 target=_blank>Damophilus</a>, when writing on the subject of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, says that <a href=/people/518 target=_blank>Plutarch</a> the Chaeronean has well remarked, that in order to her greatness alone did Virtue and Fortune unite in friendly truce: but, for myself, I would say, that in respect of Maurice alone did Piety and Good Fortune so conspire; by Piety laying compulsion upon Fortune, and not permitting her to shift at all. It was henceforward the settled aim of the emperor to wear the purple and the diadem not merely on his person but also on his soul: for he alone of recent sovereigns was sovereign of himself; and, with authority most truly centred in himself, he banished from his own soul the mob-rule of the passions, and having established an aristocracy in his own reasonings, he shewed himself a living image of virtue, training his subjects to imitation. Nor have I said this by way of flattery: for how could such be my motive, since he is not acquainted with what is being written? That such was, however, the case with Maurice, will be evidenced by the gifts bestowed upon him by God, and the circumstances of various kinds that must unquestionably be referred to divine favour. </p>                        </div>

Thus both the other classes accorded with the populace, and they clamoured forth their insults against the prelate in the streets and the theatre; and even the actors indulged in them. <a href=/people/1435 target=_blank>Asterius</a> is removed from his government, and John is invested with it, with orders from the emperor to make inquiry into the stir; a man incompetent to the management of the most trifling matters, much less a business so important. Having, in consequence, filled the city with confusion and uproar, and given public license to any one that chose, to accuse the bishop, he receives a formal charge against him from a certain banker, to the effect that he had had criminal intercourse with his own sister, married to another man. He also receives accusations from other persons of the same stamp against <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, as having repeatedly disturbed the peace of the city. On the latter charge he declared his readiness to make his defence: with respect to the others, he appealed to the emperor and a synod. Accordingly, he repaired to the imperial city, to make answer to these charges, accompanied by myself as his adviser, and is victorious after a prolonged struggle during an investigation of the matter before the patriarchs from every quarter, who appeared either in person or by deputy, as well as the sacred senate, and many most religious metropolitans: and the result was that the accuser, after having been scourged and paraded round the city, was sent into exile. <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> thence returns to his see, at the time when the troops were in a state of mutiny, and Philippicus was remaining in the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362372PBer class=place long=37.1629 lat=36.1994>Beroea</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360370UCha class=place long=37.0432 lat=35.9878>Chalcis</a>. </p>                        </div>

This convulsion levelled by far the greater part of the buildings, their very foundations being cast up by it, and all the portions of the most holy church were thrown to the ground, with the exception of the hemisphere, which, after its injury by the earthquake in the time of <a href=/people/2001 target=_blank>Justin</a>, had been secured by Ephraemius with timbers from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/361361UDap class=place long=36.1442 lat=36.13>Daphne</a>. By the subsequent shocks, it received an inclination in a northerly direction; so that the timbers were thrown by it into a leaning position, and fell, when the hemisphere had returned, by the force of the shock, exactly into its original situation, as if it had been adjusted by a rule. Nearly the entire quarter named Ostracine was ruined, and Psephium, of which I have made previous mention, as well as all the parts called Brysia, and the buildings of the venerable sanctuary of the Mother of God, with the sole exception of the central colonnade, which was singularly preserved. All the towers of the plain were also damaged, though the other buildings in that quarter escaped, with the exception of the battlements, of which some stones were thrown backwards, though they did not fall. Other churches also suffered injury, and one of the public baths, namely, that which had separate divisions according to the seasons. An incalculable number of persons were involved in the destruction, and, according to an estimate which some persons drew from the supply of bread, about sixty thousand perished. The bishop experienced a most unexpected preservation in the midst of the fall of the entire habitation where he then was, and the destruction of every individual except those who were near his person. These took up the bishop in their arms, and lowered him by a cord, after a second shock had rent an opening, and thus they removed him beyond the reach of danger. Another preservation was also granted to the city, our compassionate God having mitigated the keenness of His threatened vengeance, and corrected our sin with the branch of pity and mercy: for no conflagration followed, though so many fires were spread about the place, in hearths, public and private lamps, kitchens, furnaces, baths, and innumerable other forms. Very many persons of distinction, and among them <a href=/people/1435 target=_blank>Asterius</a> himself, became the victims of the calamity. The emperor endeavoured to alleviate this visitation by grants of money. </p>                        </div>

Since, however, this course has not hitherto been taken—it may be that Providence has not permitted it, in order that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, having been utterly defeated by men without a leader, might be thereby thoroughly taught the prowess of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and that your pure loyalty might be completely proved, in having been tested by the juncture and testified by your deeds; for you shewed that, notwithstanding your quarrel with your officers, you do not regard any thing as more important than the good of the commonwealth—let us accordingly now deliberate what ought to be your conduct. Your sovereign invites you with a promise of an amnesty of all past transactions, receiving the display of your loyalty to the commonwealth and your prowess in the field as emblems of supplication. While bestowing upon you these most certain pledges of pardon the emperor thus speaks: 'Since God has given victory to their loyalty, and, on the abandonment of their errors, a signal display has been granted to their prowess as a clear intimation of forgiveness, how can I do otherwise than follow the judgment of heaven? A king's heart is in the hand of God, and He sways it whithersoever He will.' Yield, therefore, to me at once, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>. Let us not wilfully forfeit the present opportunity, nor allow it to elude our grasp: for opportunity, when it has once slipped from us, is most unwilling to be seized, and, as if it were indignant at having been neglected, is ever after intolerant of capture. Shew yourselves the heirs of the obedience of your fathers, as ye are of their courage; in order that ye may appear altogether <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, and no taunt may touch you or point at you as degenerate. Your fathers, under the command of consuls and emperors, by obedience and courage became masters of the whole world. <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a> <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, though he crowned, yet also put to death his son, who had placed a valiant part but in disobedience of orders. For by skill on the part of the leaders, combined with obedience in those whom they lead, great successes are ordinarily achieved; but either, when bereaved of the other, is lame and unsteady, and is utterly overthrown by the separation of the excellent pair. Be not, therefore, tardy, but at once obey my call, while the priestly office mediates between the emperor and the army; and shew that your proceedings were not the establishment of a rival sovereign, but a transient display of just indignation against commanders who had wronged you: for unless you immediately embrace the offer, I shall at once consider myself as quit of the service laid upon me in this matter by my duty to the commonwealth and my regard for you. Consider too yourselves, what has been the fate of pretenders to the sovereignty. What too will be the termination of your present position? To continue concentrated is impossible: for whence will you derive your provision of ordinary fruits, or those supplies which the sea furnishes to the land, except by war between <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, and the mutual infliction of the most disgraceful treatment? What too will be the final result? You will live in dispersion, and haunted by <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>, who will henceforward disdain to bestow forgiveness. Let us therefore give pledges of amity, and consider what course will be for the benefit of ourselves and the state, at a time too when we shall have the days of the saving Passion and of the most holy Resurrection conspiring with the deed. </p>                        </div>

After a short interval they returned, and placed themselves at the disposal of the bishop. However, on his naming Philippicus to them, in order that they might themselves request him for a commander, they declared that the whole army had on this point bound themselves with fearful oaths: but the bishop, undeterred by this, without the least delay said, that he was a bishop by divine permission, and had authority to loose and bind both upon earth and in heaven, and at the same time he quoted the sacred oracle. On their yielding upon this point also, he propitiated the Deity with supplication and prayers, at the same time administering to them, the communion of the immaculate body; for it happened to be the second day of the holy passion week. After he had feasted them all, to the number of two thousand, upon couches hastily constructed on the turf, he returned home the following day.

Thus I resolved to request of thy goodness, O Saint, that she might conceive: and I made the request with a vow, that, if Sira should conceive, I would send the cross she wears to thy venerable sanctuary. On this account both I and Sira purposed to retain this cross in memory of thy name, O Saint, and in place of it to send five thousand staters, as its value, which does not really exceed four thousand four hundred staters. From the time that I conceived this request and these intentions, until I reached Rhosochosron, not more than ten days elapsed, when thou, O Saint, not on account of my worthiness but thy kindness, appearedst to me in a vision of the night and didst thrice tell me that Sira should conceive, while, in the same vision, thrice I replied, It is well. From that day forward Sira has not experienced the custom of women, because thou art the granter of requests; though I, had I not believed thy words, and that thou art holy and the granter of requests, should have doubted that she would not thenceforward experience the custom of women. From this circumstance I was convinced of the power of the vision and the truth of thy words, and accordingly forthwith sent the same cross and its value to thy venerable sanctuary, with directions that out of that sum should be made a disc, and a cup for the purposes of the divine mysteries, as also a cross to be fixed upon the holy table, and a censer, all of gold: also a Hunnish veil adorned with gold. Let the surplus of the sum belong to thy sanctuary, in order that by virtue of thy fortune, O saint, thou mayest come to the aid of me and Sira in all matters, and especially with respect to this petition; and that what has been already procured for us by thy intercession, may be consummated according to the compassion of thy goodness, and the desire of me and Sira; so that both of us, and all persons in the world, may trust in thy power and continue to believe in thee. <br />Such is the language of the offerings sent by <a href=/people/6353 target=_blank>Chosroes</a>: an instance altogether resembling the prophecy of <a href=/people/7355 target=_blank>Balaam</a>; since our compassionate God has wisely disposed it, that the tongues of Hellenes should give utterance to saving words. </p>                        </div>

His preceptor, who himself occupied a column, observing the circumstance, enquired what he had got; to which he replied, that it was an ailouron, which is usually called a <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a> [katta]. Conjecturing from this occurrence how distinguished the child would be for virtue, he took him up upon the column; and on this column, and on another, towering above the summit of the mountain, he spent sixty-eight years; earning thereby the highest gifts of grace, in respect of the ejection of demons, the healing of every disease and malady, and the foresight of future things as if they were present. <br />He also foretold to <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a> that the latter would not witness his death, but said that he was ignorant of the events which should follow it. <br />On occasion also of my ponderings on the loss of my children, when I was perplexed with the suggestion, why such things did not befall heathens who had numerous offspring; although I had not disclosed, my thoughts to any one, he wrote advising me to abandon such ideas as being displeasing to God. <br />In the case of the wife of one of my amanuenses, when the milk would not flow after child-birth, and the child was in extreme danger, laying his hand upon the right hand of her husband, he bid him place it upon the breasts of his wife.

If any matter has been overlooked by me or has been treated without sufficient accuracy, let no one blame me, considering that I have brought together scattered materials in order to the benefit of mankind; for whose sake I have submitted to so much toil. <br />I have also compiled another volume, containing memorials, epistles, decrees, orations, and disputations, and some other matters. The memorials were principally composed in the name of <a href=/people/1537 target=_blank>Gregory</a>, bishop of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Theopolis</a>; and by means of them I obtained two dignities, <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a> having conferred upon me quaestorian rank, and Maurice <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> that of prefecture, in consideration of what I composed at the time when he rid the empire of reproach in becoming the father of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, an earnest of all prosperity both to himself and the commonwealth. Evagrius the scholastic, of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/351367UEpi class=place long=36.7493 lat=35.1364>Epiphaneia</a>, of the rank of eparch, six volumes of ecclesiastical history. </p>                        </div>
