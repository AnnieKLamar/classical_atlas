Indeed the ensemble is completed by the sight, but it is marvelous in itself, for the narrowness and constriction of the strait, the near admixture of the sea with the mainland on both sides, and the expanse of deep bays and harbors that are as rich in fishing as they are excellent as shelter, and the swirling flow of the current, particularly descending, but there are times when it turns in reverse against the main stream, where the promontories protrude into it, forming a parallel track and diverting the violence of the current from the straight course. Since it is no less amenable to hearing than to seeing, it seemed to me necessary to write about this, so those who see it will miss nothing of the full and perfect story, while those who don't see it will at least have heard something about it.</p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxeinos Pontos</a> is a sea, bigger than most others but not to be compared to the Outer Sea. Only Lake <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maiotis</a> extends beyond it, which an account handed down from old memory spreads about to be the mother and nurse of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontos</a>. The circumference of this is 8000 stades, the diameter 2000 stades. The end point is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a> river, the boundary between the two continents, which rises from parts uninhabited due to the icy cold. There is a narrow outlet at the so-called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454367WBos class=place long=36.66 lat=45.36>Cimmerian Bosporos</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontos</a> receives it all and spreads out greatly from each continent. Settled around it by the sea there are Greek cities, which some of the Greeks colonized after the birth of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, but away from the sea are many and numerous barbarian nations. The sea takes a share of the lake and a multitude of rivers flowing into it from both continents sweeten its natural harshness. It ends in the Thracian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosporos</a> and empties through the Stoma.</p>                        </div>

Nor is it straight but interrupted by the continuous, parallel protrusions of promontories, besides which there are continuous eddies and interruptions of the sea's flow. For the current, compressed into a small area and squeezed by the narrowness of the continents, flows down by fits and starts. The headlands of the continents overlap each other and almost deceive sailors that the way forward is barred. This seems to me why they call the rocks <a href=/people/11008 target=_blank>Symplegades</a> (clashing together) because when you sail toward them they separate and when you sail away they come together, opinion being deceived by the appearance.

The circuit wall goes along the sea, except where it diverges gently on both sides to meet the Thracian wall. Through the middle it is somewhat level, though not at the extremes, and on both sides there is flat ground by the sea. That sea is deep close inshore, and with strong currents driven by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> sea and the narrowness of the passage and the impact and refluxes that strike the city in a mass.

It is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290WKer class=place long=28.9674 lat=41.022>Horn</a> from the similarity of the shape. It surpasses a gulf in depth, as I said, and a harbor in convenience. For big mountains surround it protecting it from the violence of the winds, and the city and the land opposite shut out the sea at the mouth, running along it and reducing the speed of the flow, and its narrowness sideways.

Where it protrudes the rough violence of the current strikes it like a statue/dragon (?). Sometimes the back-flowing turmoil of the sea presses against it, sometimes the surge pushes the sea the opposite way. I have seen many ships with a full following wind in their sails being borne backwards, with the current defeating the wind. Just beside the rock, it turns back again and from the convulsive recoil of the sea it moves backwards by itself. Fear and confusion strike the sailors as for no other experience. Whence most of the passage toward a steep place where the current strikes is by main strength, tying ropes to the ships and hauling them from the shore. There is a place where it yields and slackens a little by the landing and beside these rocks they contend with the current, supporting their oars on the rocky shore and securing the sea's power for themselves by an alliance with the land. Some marks and impressions are shown of the sea crabs that bypass on land the strongest part of the current. <br />The place is called Hestiai (hearths). For the leaders of the colony seized it with their ships, when, having passed the Bosporion headland they saw a great host of the barbarian army occupying the landings. And they founded the Hestiai by cities, each one where first they landed. When they perceived the barbarians coming against them, they waited until most of them had left their places and then let the fleet out into the current and so seized the now unguarded headland empty of men, outmaneuvering the barbarians. For it was not a long sail, since they cut off the gulfs, but a long way round for those on land. Some say the Hestiai are not from the cities but from seven of the best <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=demonym long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarian</a> families.

For neither is without its terror. Others say that a boy wandering on shore returned shortly after his ship had left the port, and, overcome by despair for his safety, stretched his hands up to heaven, but that the god heard the prayers of the boy and returned the ship to port. Others say that on the occasion of a great calmness of the sea, while every wind was still and a ship was long delayed, its sailors were struggling under the scarcity of the port's supplies. Whereupon a vision appeared to the captain, ordering the captain to sacrifice his own son, since by no other means could the voyage and the winds resume. But at the moment when the captain, being compelled by necessity, was ready to sacrifice the boy, it is said that the boy stretched out his hands, and that the god, moved by pity at the senseless punishment of the boy or the boy's youth, took up the boy and sent a favorable wind.
