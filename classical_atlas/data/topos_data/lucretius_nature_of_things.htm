Indeed, and were there not <br />For each its procreant atoms, could things have <br />Each its unalterable mother old? <br />But, since produced from fixed seeds are all, <br />Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light <br />From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies. <br />And all from all cannot become, because <br />In each resides a secret power its own. <br />Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands <br />At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn, <br />The vines that mellow when the autumn lures, <br />If not because the fixed seeds of things <br />At their own season must together stream, <br />And new creations only be revealed <br />When the due times arrive and pregnant earth <br />Safely may give unto the shores of light <br />Her tender progenies? But if from naught <br />Were their becoming, they would spring abroad <br />Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months, <br />With no primordial germs, to be preserved <br />From procreant unions at an adverse hour.</p>                        </div>

But now <br />Because the fastenings of primordial parts <br />Are put together diversely and stuff <br />Is everlasting, things abide the same <br />Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on <br />Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each: <br />Nothing returns to naught; but all return <br />At their collapse to primal forms of stuff. <br />Lo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws <br />Down to the bosom of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>-mother; but then <br />Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green <br />Amid the trees, and trees themselves wax big <br />And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn <br />The race of man and all the wild are fed; <br />Hence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls; <br />And leafy woodlands echo with new birds; <br />Hence <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk <br />Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops <br />Of white ooze trickle from distended bags; <br />Hence the young scamper on their weakling joints <br />Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk <br />With warm new milk.

Thus on they rave <br />With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds, <br />'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through <br />The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky, <br />Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain; <br />And forth they flow and pile destruction round, <br />Even as the water's soft and supple bulk <br />Becoming a river of abounding floods, <br />Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills <br />Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down <br />Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees; <br />Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock <br />As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream, <br />Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers, <br />Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves <br />Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone, <br />Hurling away whatever would oppose. <br />Even so must move the blasts of all the winds, <br />Which, when they spread, like to a mighty flood, <br />Hither or thither, drive things on before <br />And hurl to ground with still renewed assault, <br />Or sometimes in their circling vortex seize <br />And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world: <br />The winds are sightless bodies and naught else- <br />Since both in works and ways they rival well <br />The mighty rivers, the visible in form. <br />Then too we know the varied smells of things <br />Yet never to our nostrils see them come; <br />With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold, <br />Nor are we wont men's voices to behold. <br />Yet these must be corporeal at the base, <br />Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is <br />Save body, having property of touch. <br />And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist, <br />The same, spread out before the sun, will dry; <br />Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in, <br />Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know, <br />That moisture is dispersed about in bits <br />Too small for eyes to see. Another case: <br />A ring upon the finger thins away <br />Along the under side, with years and suns; <br />The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone; <br />The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes <br />Amid the fields insidiously. We view <br />The rock-paved highways worn by many feet; <br />And at the gates the brazen statues show <br />Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch <br />Of wayfarers innumerable who greet. <br />We see how wearing-down hath minished these, <br />But just what motes depart at any time, <br />The envious nature of vision bars our sight. <br />Lastly whatever days and nature add <br />Little by little, constraining things to grow <br />In due proportion, no gaze however keen <br />Of these our eyes hath watched and known.

Again, <br />Where can the billows yield a way, so long <br />As ever the fish are powerless to go? <br />Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived, <br />Or things contain admixture of a void <br />Where each thing gets its start in moving on. <br /> Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies <br />Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd <br />The whole new void between those bodies formed; <br />But air, however it stream with hastening gusts, <br />Can yet not fill the gap at once- for first <br />It makes for one place, ere diffused through all. <br />And then, if haply any think this comes, <br />When bodies spring apart, because the air <br />Somehow condenses, wander they from truth: <br />For then a void is formed, where none before; <br />And, too, a void is filled which was before. <br />Nor can air be condensed in such a wise; <br />Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold, <br />It still could not contract upon itself <br />And draw its parts together into one. <br />Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech, <br />Confess thou must there is a void in things. <br /> And still I might by many an argument <br />Here scrape together credence for my words. <br />But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve, <br />Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself. <br />As <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> full oft with noses on the ground, <br />Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush, <br />Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once <br />They scent the certain footsteps of the way, <br />Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone <br />Can hunt from thought to thought, and keenly wind <br />Along even onward to the secret places <br />And drag out truth. But, if thou loiter loth <br />Or veer, however little, from the point, <br />This I can promise, <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, for a fact: <br />Such copious drafts my singing tongue shall pour <br />From the large well-springs of my plenished breast <br />That much I dread slow age will steal and coil <br />Along our members, and unloose the gates <br />Of life within us, ere for thee my verse <br />Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs <br />At hand for one soever question broached. <br />NOTHING EXISTS per se EXCEPT ATOMS AND THE VOID <br />But, now again to weave the tale begun, <br />All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists <br />Of twain of things: of bodies and of void <br />In which they're set, and where they're moved around. <br />For common instinct of our race declares <br />That body of itself exists: unless <br />This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not, <br />Naught will there be whereunto to appeal <br />On things occult when seeking aught to prove <br />By reasonings of mind. Again, without <br />That place and room, which we do call the inane, <br />Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go <br />Hither or thither at all- as shown before. <br />Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare <br />It lives disjoined from body, shut from void- <br />A kind of third in nature. For whatever <br />Exists must be a somewhat; and the same, <br />If tangible, however fight and slight, <br />Will yet increase the count of body's sum, <br />With its own augmentation big or small; <br />But, if intangible and powerless ever <br />To keep a thing from passing through itself <br />On any side, 'twill be naught else but that <br />Which we do call the empty, the inane. <br />Again, whate'er exists, as of itself, <br />Must either act or suffer action on it, <br />Or else be that wherein things move and be: <br />Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on; <br />Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus, <br />Beside the inane and bodies, is no third <br />Nature amid the number of all things- <br />Remainder none to fall at any time <br />Under our senses, nor be seized and seen <br />By any man through reasonings of mind. <br />Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt, <br />Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain, <br />Or see but accidents those twain produce. <br /> A property is that which not at all <br />Can be disjoined and severed from a thing <br />Without a fatal dissolution: such, <br />Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow <br />To the wide waters, touch to corporal things, <br />Intangibility to the viewless void. <br />But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth, <br />Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else <br />Which come and go whilst nature stands the same, <br />We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents. <br />Even time exists not of itself; but sense <br />Reads out of things what happened long ago, <br />What presses now, and what shall follow after: <br />No man, we must admit, feels time itself, <br />Disjoined from motion and repose of things. <br />Thus, when they say there is the ravishment <br />Of Princess <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>, is the siege and sack <br />Of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> Town, look out, they force us not <br />To admit these acts existent by themselves, <br />Merely because those races of mankind <br />(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since <br />Irrevocable age has borne away: <br />For all past actions may be said to be <br />But accidents, in one way, of mankind,- <br />In other, of some region of the world. <br />Add, too, had been no matter, and no room <br />Wherein all things go on, the fire of love <br />Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal <br />Under the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=person long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s breast, <br />Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife <br />Of savage war, nor had the <a href=/people/12276 target=_blank>Wooden Horse</a><br />Involved in flames old <a href=/people/2062 target=_blank>Pergama</a>, by a birth <br />At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes. <br />And thus thou canst remark that every act <br />At bottom exists not of itself, nor is <br />As body is, nor has like name with void; <br />But rather of sort more fitly to be called <br />An accident of body, and of place <br />Wherein all things go on. <br />CHARACTER OF THE ATOMS <br />Bodies, again, <br />Are partly primal germs of things, and partly <br />Unions deriving from the primal germs. <br />And those which are the primal germs of things <br />No power can quench; for in the end they conquer <br />By their own solidness; though hard it be <br />To think that aught in things has solid frame; <br />For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout, <br />Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron <br />White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn <br />With exhalations fierce and burst asunder. <br />Totters the rigid gold dissolved in heat; <br />The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame; <br />Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep, <br />Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand, <br />We oft feel both, as from above is poured <br />The dew of waters between their shining sides: <br />So true it is no solid form is found. <br />But yet because true reason and nature of things <br />Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now <br />I disentangle how there still exist <br />Bodies of solid, everlasting frame- <br />The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach, <br />Whence all creation around us came to be. <br />First since we know a twofold nature exists, <br />Of things, both twain and utterly unlike- <br />Body, and place in which an things go on- <br />Then each must be both for and through itself, <br />And all unmixed: where'er be empty space, <br />There body's not; and so where body bides, <br />There not at all exists the void inane. <br />Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void. <br />But since there's void in all begotten things, <br />All solid matter must be round the same; <br />Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides <br />And holds a void within its body, unless <br />Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know, <br />That which can hold a void of things within <br />Can be naught else than matter in union knit. <br />Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame, <br />Hath power to be eternal, though all else, <br />Though all creation, be dissolved away. <br />Again, were naught of empty and inane, <br />The world were then a solid; as, without <br />Some certain bodies to fill the places held, <br />The world that is were but a vacant void. <br />And so, infallibly, alternate-wise <br />Body and void are still distinguished, <br />Since nature knows no wholly full nor void. <br />There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power <br />To vary forever the empty and the full; <br />And these can nor be sundered from without <br />By beats and blows, nor from within be torn <br />By penetration, nor be overthrown <br />By any assault soever through the world- <br />For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems, <br />Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain, <br />Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold <br />Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three; <br />But the more void within a thing, the more <br />Entirely it totters at their sure assault. <br />Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught, <br />Solid, without a void, they must be then <br />Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been <br />Eternal, long ere now had all things gone <br />Back into nothing utterly, and all <br />We see around from nothing had been born- <br />But since I taught above that naught can be <br />From naught created, nor the once begotten <br />To naught be summoned back, these primal germs <br />Must have an immortality of frame. <br />And into these must each thing be resolved, <br />When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be <br />At hand the stuff for plenishing the world. <br /> . . . . . . <br />So primal germs have solid singleness <br />Nor otherwise could they have been conserved <br />Through aeons and infinity of time <br />For the replenishment of wasted worlds. <br />Once more, if nature had given a scope for things <br />To be forever broken more and more, <br />By now the bodies of matter would have been <br />So far reduced by breakings in old days <br />That from them nothing could, at season fixed, <br />Be born, and arrive its prime and top of life. <br />For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made; <br />And so whate'er the long infinitude <br />Of days and all fore-passed time would now <br />By this have broken and ruined and dissolved, <br />That same could ne'er in all remaining time <br />Be builded up for plenishing the world. <br />But mark: infallibly a fixed bound <br />Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down; <br />Since we behold each thing soever renewed, <br />And unto all, their seasons, after their kind, <br />Wherein they arrive the flower of their age.</p>                        </div>

But since true reason here <br />Protests, denying that the mind can think it, <br />Convinced thou must confess such things there are <br />As have no parts, the minimums of nature. <br />And since these are, likewise confess thou must <br />That primal bodies are solid and eterne. <br />Again, if Nature, creatress of all things, <br />Were wont to force all things to be resolved <br />Unto least parts, then would she not avail <br />To reproduce from out them anything; <br />Because whate'er is not endowed with parts <br />Cannot possess those properties required <br />Of generative stuff- divers connections, <br />Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things <br />Forevermore have being and go on. <br />CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS <br /> And on such grounds it is that those who held <br />The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire <br />Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen <br />Mightily from true reason to have lapsed. <br />Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes <br />That <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a>, famous for dark speech <br />Among the silly, not the serious Greeks <br />Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone <br />That to bewonder and adore which hides <br />Beneath distorted words, holding that true <br />Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears, <br />Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase. <br />For how, I ask, can things so varied be, <br />If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit <br />'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned, <br />If all the parts of fire did still preserve <br />But fire's own nature, seen before in gross. <br />The heat were keener with the parts compressed, <br />Milder, again, when severed or dispersed- <br />And more than this thou canst conceive of naught <br />That from such causes could become; much less <br />Might earth's variety of things be born <br />From any fires soever, dense or rare. <br />This too: if they suppose a void in things, <br />Then fires can be condensed and still left rare; <br />But since they see such opposites of thought <br />Rising against them, and are loath to leave <br />An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep <br />And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see, <br />That, if from things we take away the void, <br />All things are then condensed, and out of all <br />One body made, which has no power to dart <br />Swiftly from out itself not anything- <br />As throws the fire its light and warmth around, <br />Giving thee proof its parts are not compact. <br />But if perhaps they think, in other wise, <br />Fires through their combinations can be quenched <br />And change their substance, very well: behold, <br />If fire shall spare to do so in no part, <br />Then heat will perish utterly and all, <br />And out of nothing would the world be formed. <br />For change in anything from out its bounds <br />Means instant death of that which was before; <br />And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed <br />Amid the world, lest all return to naught, <br />And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew. <br />Now since indeed there are those surest bodies <br />Which keep their nature evermore the same, <br />Upon whose going out and coming in <br />And changed order things their nature change, <br />And all corporeal substances transformed, <br />'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then, <br />Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail <br />Should some depart and go away, and some <br />Be added new, and some be changed in order, <br />If still all kept their nature of old heat: <br />For whatsoever they created then <br />Would still in any case be only fire. <br />The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are <br />Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes <br />Produce the fire and which, by order changed, <br />Do change the nature of the thing produced, <br />And are thereafter nothing like to fire <br />Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies <br />With impact touching on the senses' touch. <br /> Again, to say that all things are but fire <br />And no true thing in number of all things <br />Exists but fire, as this same fellow says, <br />Seems crazed folly. For the man himself <br />Against the senses by the senses fights, <br />And hews at that through which is all belief, <br />Through which indeed unto himself is known <br />The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks <br />The senses truly can perceive the fire, <br />He thinks they cannot as regards all else, <br />Which still are palpably as clear to sense- <br />To me a thought inept and crazy too. <br />For whither shall we make appeal? for what <br />More certain than our senses can there be <br />Whereby to mark asunder error and truth? <br />Besides, why rather do away with all, <br />And wish to allow heat only, then deny <br />The fire and still allow all else to be?- <br />Alike the madness either way it seems.</p>                        </div>

Wherefore, since <br />Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign <br />Avail us naught for this our body, thus <br />Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind: <br />Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth <br />Thy legions swarming round the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Field of Mars</a>, <br />Rousing a mimic warfare- either side <br />Strengthened with large auxiliaries and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, <br />Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired; <br />Or save when also thou beholdest forth <br />Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea: <br />For then, by such bright circumstance abashed, <br />Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then <br />The fears of death leave heart so free of care. <br />But if we note how all this pomp at last <br />Is but a drollery and a mocking sport, <br />And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels, <br />Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords <br />But among kings and lords of all the world <br />Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed <br />By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright <br />Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this <br />Is aught, but power of thinking?- when, besides <br />The whole of life but labours in the dark. <br />For just as children tremble and fear all <br />In the viewless dark, so even we at times <br />Dread in the light so many things that be <br />No whit more fearsome than what children feign, <br />Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark. <br />This terror then, this darkness of the mind, <br />Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light, <br />Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse, <br />But only nature's aspect and her law. <br /> ATOMIC MOTIONS <br /> Now come: I will untangle for thy steps <br />Now by what motions the begetting bodies <br />Of the world-stuff beget the varied world, <br />And then forever resolve it when begot, <br />And by what force they are constrained to this, <br />And what the speed appointed unto them <br />Wherewith to travel down the vast inane: <br />Do thou remember to yield thee to my words. <br />For truly matter coheres not, crowds not tight, <br />Since we behold each thing to wane away, <br />And we observe how all flows on and off, <br />As 'twere, with age-old time, and from our eyes <br />How eld withdraws each object at the end, <br />Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same, <br />Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing <br />Diminish what they part from, but endow <br />With increase those to which in turn they come, <br />Constraining these to wither in old age, <br />And those to flower at the prime (and yet <br />Biding not long among them). Thus the sum <br />Forever is replenished, and we live <br />As mortals by eternal give and take. <br />The nations wax, the nations wane away; <br />In a brief space the generations pass, <br />And like to runners hand the lamp of life <br />One unto other.</p>                        </div>

For were it not their wont <br />Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one, <br />Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void; <br />And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows <br />Among the primal elements; and thus <br />Nature would never have created aught. <br /> But, if perchance be any that believe <br />The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne <br />Plumb down the void, are able from above <br />To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows <br />Able to cause those procreant motions, far <br />From highways of true reason they retire. <br />For whatsoever through the waters fall, <br />Or through thin air, must quicken their descent, <br />Each after its weight- on this account, because <br />Both bulk of water and the subtle air <br />By no means can retard each thing alike, <br />But give more quick before the heavier weight; <br />But contrariwise the empty void cannot, <br />On any side, at any time, to aught <br />Oppose resistance, but will ever yield, <br />True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all, <br />With equal speed, though equal not in weight, <br />Must rush, borne downward through the still inane. <br />Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above <br />Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes <br />Which cause those divers motions, by whose means <br />Nature transacts her work. And so I say, <br />The atoms must a little swerve at times- <br />But only the least, lest we should seem to feign <br />Motions oblique, and fact refute us there. <br />For this we see forthwith is manifest: <br />Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go, <br />Down on its headlong journey from above, <br />At least so far as thou canst mark; but who <br />Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve <br />At all aside from off its road's straight line? <br /> Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked, <br />And from the old ever arise the new <br />In fixed order, and primordial seeds <br />Produce not by their swerving some new start <br />Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate, <br />That cause succeed not cause from everlasting, <br />Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands, <br />Whence is it wrested from the fates,- this will <br />Whereby we step right forward where desire <br />Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve <br />In motions, not as at some fixed time, <br />Nor at some fixed line of space, but where <br />The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt <br />In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself <br />That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs <br />Incipient motions are diffused. Again, <br />Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time, <br />The bars are opened, how the eager strength <br />Of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> cannot forward break as soon <br />As pants their mind to do? For it behooves <br />That all the stock of matter, through the frame, <br />Be roused, in order that, through every joint, <br />Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire; <br />So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered <br />From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds <br />First from the spirit's will, whence at the last <br />'Tis given forth through joints and body entire. <br />Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move, <br />Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers <br />And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough <br />All matter of our total body goes, <br />Hurried along, against our own desire- <br />Until the will has pulled upon the reins <br />And checked it back, throughout our members all; <br />At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes <br />The stock of matter's forced to change its path, <br />Throughout our members and throughout our joints, <br />And, after being forward cast, to be <br />Reined up, whereat it settles back again. <br />So seest thou not, how, though external force <br />Drive men before, and often make them move, <br />Onward against desire, and headlong snatched, <br />Yet is there something in these breasts of ours <br />Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?- <br />Wherefore no less within the primal seeds <br />Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight, <br />Some other cause of motion, whence derives <br />This power in us inborn, of some free act.- <br />Since naught from nothing can become, we see. <br />For weight prevents all things should come to pass <br />Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force; <br />But that man's mind itself in all it does <br />Hath not a fixed necessity within, <br />Nor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled <br />To bear and suffer,- this state comes to man <br />From that slight swervement of the elements <br />In no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.</p>                        </div>

Often thus, <br />Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks <br />Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about <br />Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed <br />With the fresh dew, is calling, and the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a>, <br />Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport: <br />Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar- <br />A glint of white at rest on a green hill. <br />Again, when mighty legions, marching round, <br />Fill all the quarters of the plains below, <br />Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen <br />Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about <br />Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound <br />Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery, <br />And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send <br />The voices onward to the stars of heaven, <br />And hither and thither darts the cavalry, <br />And of a sudden down the midmost fields <br />Charges with onset stout enough to rock <br />The solid earth: and yet some post there is <br />Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem <br />To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains. <br /> ATOMIC FORMS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS <br /> Now come, and next hereafter apprehend <br />What sorts, how vastly different in form, <br />How varied in multitudinous shapes they are- <br />These old beginnings of the universe; <br />Not in the sense that only few are furnished <br />With one like form, but rather not at all <br />In general have they likeness each with each, <br />No marvel: since the stock of them's so great <br />That there's no end (as I have taught) nor sum, <br />They must indeed not one and all be marked <br />By equal outline and by shape the same. <br /> . . . . . . <br />Moreover, humankind, and the mute flocks <br />Of scaly creatures swimming in the streams, <br />And joyous herds around, and all the wild, <br />And all the breeds of birds- both those that teem <br />In gladsome regions of the water-haunts, <br />About the river-banks and springs and pools, <br />And those that throng, flitting from tree to tree, <br />Through trackless woods- Go, take which one thou wilt, <br />In any kind: thou wilt discover still <br />Each from the other still unlike in shape. <br />Nor in no other wise could offspring know <br />Mother, nor mother offspring- which we see <br />They yet can do, distinguished one from other, <br />No less than human beings, by clear signs. <br />Thus oft before fair temples of the gods, <br />Beside the incense-burning altars slain, <br />Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast <br />Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother, <br />Ranging meanwhile green woodland pastures round, <br />Knows well the footprints, pressed by cloven hoofs, <br />With eyes regarding every spot about, <br />For sight somewhere of youngling gone from her; <br />And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes <br />With her complaints; and oft she seeks again <br />Within the stall, pierced by her yearning still. <br />Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass, <br />Nor the loved streams that glide along low banks, <br />Can lure her mind and turn the sudden pain; <br />Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby <br />Distract her mind or lighten pain the least- <br />So keen her search for something known and hers. <br />Moreover, tender <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> with bleating throats <br />Do know their horned dams, and butting <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a><br />The flocks of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, and thus they patter on, <br />Unfailingly each to its proper teat, <br />As nature intends. Lastly, with any grain, <br />Thou'lt see that no one kernel in one kind <br />Is so far like another, that there still <br />Is not in shapes some difference running through. <br />By a like law we see how earth is pied <br />With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea <br />Beats on the thirsty sands of curving shores. <br />Wherefore again, again, since seeds of things <br />Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands <br />After a fixed pattern of one other, <br />They needs must flitter to and fro with shapes <br />In types dissimilar to one another.</p>                        </div>

What was before from earth, <br />The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent <br />From shores of ether, that, returning home, <br />The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death <br />So far annihilate things that she destroys <br />The bodies of matter; but she dissipates <br />Their combinations, and conjoins anew <br />One element with others; and contrives <br />That all things vary forms and change their colours <br />And get sensations and straight give them o'er. <br />And thus may'st know it matters with what others <br />And in what structure the primordial germs <br />Are held together, and what motions they <br />Among themselves do give and get; nor think <br />That aught we see hither and thither afloat <br />Upon the crest of things, and now a birth <br />And straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest <br />Deep in the eternal atoms of the world. <br /> Why, even in these our very verses here <br />It matters much with what and in what order <br />Each element is set: the same denote <br />Sky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and sun; <br />The same, the grains, and trees, and living things. <br />And if not all alike, at least the most- <br />But what distinctions by positions wrought! <br />And thus no less in things themselves, when once <br />Around are changed the intervals between, <br />The paths of matter, its connections, weights, <br />Blows, clashings, motions, order, structure, shapes, <br />The things themselves must likewise changed be. <br /> Now to true reason give thy mind for us. <br />Since here strange truth is putting forth its might <br />To hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect <br />Of things to show its front. Yet naught there is <br />So easy that it standeth not at first <br />More hard to credit than it after is; <br />And naught soe'er that's great to such degree, <br />Nor wonderful so far, but all mankind <br />Little by little abandon their surprise. <br />Look upward yonder at the bright clear sky <br />And what it holds- the stars that wander o'er, <br />The moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun: <br />Yet all, if now they first for mortals were, <br />If unforeseen now first asudden shown, <br />What might there be more wonderful to tell, <br />What that the nations would before have dared <br />Less to believe might be?- I fancy, naught- <br />So strange had been the marvel of that sight. <br />The which o'erwearied to behold, to-day <br />None deigns look upward to those lucent realms. <br />Then, spew not reason from thy mind away, <br />Beside thyself because the matter's new, <br />But rather with keen judgment nicely weigh; <br />And if to thee it then appeareth true, <br />Render thy hands, or, if 'tis false at last, <br />Gird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man <br />Now seeks the nature of the vast Beyond <br />There on the other side, that boundless sum <br />Which lies without the ramparts of the world, <br />Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar, <br />Toward which indeed the swift elan of thought <br />Flies unencumbered forth.</p>                        </div>

[But some hold] <br />That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated, <br />But is of body some one vital state,- <br />Named harmony by Greeks, because thereby <br />We live with sense, though intellect be not <br />In any part: as oft the body is said <br />To have good health (when health, however, 's not <br />One part of him who has it), so they place <br />The sense of mind in no fixed part of man. <br />Mightily, diversly, meseems they err. <br />Often the body palpable and seen <br />Sickens, while yet in some invisible part <br />We feel a pleasure; oft the other way, <br />A miserable in mind feels pleasure still <br />Throughout his body- quite the same as when <br />A foot may pain without a pain in head. <br />Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er <br />To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame <br />At random void of sense, a something else <br />Is yet within us, which upon that time <br />Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving <br />All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart. <br />Now, for to see that in man's members dwells <br />Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont <br />To feel sensation by a harmony <br />Take this in chief: the fact that life remains <br />Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone; <br />Yet that same life, when particles of heat, <br />Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth <br />Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith <br />Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones. <br />Thus mayst thou know that not all particles <br />Perform like parts, nor in like manner all <br />Are props of weal and safety: rather those- <br />The seeds of wind and exhalations warm- <br />Take care that in our members life remains. <br />Therefore a vital heat and wind there is <br />Within the very body, which at death <br />Deserts our frames.

Thus the race of men: <br />Though training make them equally refined, <br />It leaves those pristine vestiges behind <br />Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose <br />Evil can e'er be rooted up so far <br />That one man's not more given to fits of wrath, <br />Another's not more quickly touched by fear, <br />A third not more long-suffering than he should. <br />And needs must differ in many things besides <br />The varied natures and resulting habits <br />Of humankind- of which not now can I <br />Expound the hidden causes, nor find names <br />Enough for all the divers shapes of those <br />Primordials whence this variation springs. <br />But this meseems I'm able to declare: <br />Those vestiges of natures left behind <br />Which reason cannot quite expel from us <br />Are still so slight that naught prevents a man <br />From living a life even worthy of the gods. <br /> So then this soul is kept by all the body, <br />Itself the body's guard, and source of weal: <br />For they with common roots cleave each to each, <br />Nor can be torn asunder without death. <br />Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense <br />To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature <br />Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis <br />From all the body nature of mind and soul <br />To draw away, without the whole dissolved. <br />With seeds so intertwined even from birth, <br />They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life; <br />No energy of body or mind, apart, <br />Each of itself without the other's power, <br />Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled <br />Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both <br />With mutual motions. Besides the body alone <br />Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death <br />Seen to endure. For not as water at times <br />Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby <br />Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains- <br />Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame <br />Bear the dissevering of its joined soul, <br />But, rent and ruined, moulders all away. <br />Thus the joint contact of the body and soul <br />Learns from their earliest age the vital motions, <br />Even when still buried in the mother's womb; <br />So no dissevering can hap to them, <br />Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see <br />That, as conjoined is their source of weal, <br />Conjoined also must their nature be.</p>                        </div>

No marvel, because, commixed <br />Through veins and inwards, and through bones and thews, <br />Their elements primordial are confined <br />By all the body, and own no power free <br />To bound around through interspaces big, <br />Thus, shut within these confines, they take on <br />Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out <br />Beyond the body to the winds of air, <br />Take on they cannot- and on this account, <br />Because no more in such a way confined. <br />For air will be a body, be alive, <br />If in that air the soul can keep itself, <br />And in that air enclose those motions all <br />Which in the thews and in the body itself <br />A while ago 'twas making.

And hence indeed <br />Alone by self they can nor feel nor be. <br /> And since we mark the vital sense to be <br />In the whole body, all one living thing, <br />If of a sudden a force with rapid stroke <br />Should slice it down the middle and cleave in twain, <br />Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself, <br />Divided, dissevered, asunder will be flung <br />Along with body.

A third attempts <br />With leg dismembered to arise and stand, <br />Whilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot <br />Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head, <br />When from the warm and living trunk lopped off, <br />Keeps on the ground the vital countenance <br />And open eyes, until 't has rendered up <br />All remnants of the soul.

Again, how often <br />We view our fellow going by degrees, <br />And losing limb by limb the vital sense; <br />First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue, <br />Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest <br />Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death. <br />And since this nature of the soul is torn, <br />Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire, <br />We needs must hold it mortal. But perchance <br />If thou supposest that the soul itself <br />Can inward draw along the frame, and bring <br />Its parts together to one place, and so <br />From all the members draw the sense away, <br />Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul <br />Collected is, should greater seem in sense. <br />But since such place is nowhere, for a fact, <br />As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth, <br />And so goes under. Or again, if now <br />I please to grant the false, and say that soul <br />Can thus be lumped within the frames of those <br />Who leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit, <br />Still must the soul as mortal be confessed; <br />Nor aught it matters whether to wrack it go, <br />Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass <br />From all its parts, sink down to brutish death, <br />Since more and more in every region sense <br />Fails the whole man, and less and less of life <br />In every region lingers.</p>                        </div>

And so, when smooth <br />The bodies of the oozy flavour, then <br />Delightfully they touch, delightfully <br />They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling <br />Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise, <br />They sting and pain the sense with their assault, <br />According as with roughness they're supplied. <br />Next, only up to palate is the pleasure <br />Coming from flavour; for in truth when down <br />'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is, <br />Whilst into all the frame it spreads around; <br />Nor aught it matters with what food is fed <br />The body, if only what thou take thou canst <br />Distribute well digested to the frame <br />And keep the stomach in a moist career. <br /> Now, how it is we see some food for some, <br />Others for others.... <br /> . . . . . . <br />I will unfold, or wherefore what to some <br />Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others <br />Can seem delectable to eat,- why here <br />So great the distance and the difference is <br />That what is food to one to some becomes <br />Fierce poison, as a certain <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a> there is <br />Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste <br />And end itself by gnawing up its coil. <br />Again, fierce poison is the hellebore <br />To us, but puts the fat on <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> and quails. <br />That thou mayst know by what devices this <br />Is brought about, in chief thou must recall <br />What we have said before, that seeds are kept <br />Commixed in things in divers modes. Again, <br />As all the breathing creatures which take food <br />Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut <br />And contour of their members bounds them round, <br />Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist <br />Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore, <br />Since seeds do differ, divers too must be <br />The interstices and paths (which we do call <br />The apertures) in all the members, even <br />In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be <br />More small or yet more large, three-cornered some <br />And others squared, and many others round, <br />And certain of them many-angled too <br />In many modes. For, as the combination <br />And motion of their divers shapes demand, <br />The shapes of apertures must be diverse <br />And paths must vary according to their walls <br />That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some, <br />Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom <br />'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs <br />Have entered caressingly the palate's pores. <br />And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet <br />Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt <br />The rough and barbed particles have got <br />Into the narrows of the apertures. <br />Now easy it is from these affairs to know <br />Whatever... <br /> . . . . . . <br />Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile <br />Is stricken with fever, or in other wise <br />Feels the roused violence of some malady, <br />There the whole frame is now upset, and there <br />All the positions of the seeds are changed,- <br />So that the bodies which before were fit <br />To cause the savour, now are fit no more, <br />And now more apt are others which be able <br />To get within the pores and gender sour. <br />Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey- <br />What oft we've proved above to thee before.</p>                        </div>

But for some breathing creatures <br />One odour is more apt, to others another- <br />Because of differing forms of seeds and pores. <br />Thus on and on along the zephyrs <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a><br />Are led by odour of honey, vultures too <br />By carcasses. Again, the forward power <br />Of scent in <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> doth lead the hunter on <br />Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast <br />Hath hastened its career; and the white goose, <br />The saviour of the Roman citadel, <br />Forescents afar the odour of mankind. <br />Thus, diversly to divers ones is given <br />Peculiar smell that leadeth each along <br />To his own food or makes him start aback <br />From loathsome poison, and in this wise are <br />The generations of the wild preserved. <br /> Yet is this pungence not alone in odours <br />Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise, <br />The look of things and hues agree not all <br />So well with senses unto all, but that <br />Some unto some will be, to gaze upon, <br />More keen and painful. Lo, the raving <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>, <br />They dare not face and gaze upon the cock <br />Who's wont with wings to flap away the night <br />From off the stage, and call the beaming morn <br />With clarion voice- and <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> straightway thus <br />Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see, <br />Within the body of the cocks there be <br />Some certain seeds, which, into <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>' eyes <br />Injected, bore into the pupils deep <br />And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out <br />Against the cocks, however fierce they be- <br />Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least, <br />Either because they do not penetrate, <br />Or since they have free exit from the eyes <br />As soon as penetrating, so that thus <br />They cannot hurt our eyes in any part <br />By there remaining. <br /> To speak once more of odour; <br />Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel <br />A longer way than others. None of them, <br />However, 's borne so far as sound or voice- <br />While I omit all mention of such things <br />As hit the eyesight and assail the vision. <br />For slowly on a wandering course it comes <br />And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed <br />Easily into all the winds of air;- <br />And first, because from deep inside the thing <br />It is discharged with labour (for the fact <br />That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground, <br />Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger <br />Is sign that odours flow and part away <br />From inner regions of the things). And next, <br />Thou mayest see that odour is create <br />Of larger primal germs than voice, because <br />It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough <br />Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne; <br />Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not <br />So easy to trace out in whatso place <br />The smelling object is.

For, indeed, <br />Far thinner are they in their fabric than <br />Those images which take a hold on eyes <br />And smite the vision, since through body's pores <br />They penetrate, and inwardly stir up <br />The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense. <br />Thus, <a href=/people/553 target=_blank>Centaurs</a> and the limbs of <a href=/people/8291 target=_blank>Scyllas</a>, thus <br />The <a href=/people/752 target=_blank>Cerberus</a>-visages of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> we see, <br />And images of people gone before- <br />Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago; <br />Because the images of every kind <br />Are everywhere about us borne- in part <br />Those which are gendered in the very air <br />Of own accord, in part those others which <br />From divers things do part away, and those <br />Which are compounded, made from out their shapes. <br />For soothly from no living Centaur is <br />That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast <br />Like him was ever; but, when images <br />Of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and man by chance have come together, <br />They easily cohere, as aforesaid, <br />At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin. <br />In the same fashion others of this ilk <br />Created are. And when they're quickly borne <br />In their exceeding lightness, easily <br />(As earlier I showed) one subtle image, <br />Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind, <br />Itself so subtle and so strangely quick. <br /> That these things come to pass as I record, <br />From this thou easily canst understand: <br />So far as one is unto other like, <br />Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes <br />Must come to pass in fashion not unlike. <br />Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive <br />Haply a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> through those idol-films <br />Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know <br />Also the mind is in like manner moved, <br />And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see <br />(Except that it perceives more subtle films) <br />The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and aught else through idol-films. <br />And when the sleep has overset our frame, <br />The mind's intelligence is now awake, <br />Still for no other reason, save that these- <br />The self-same films as when we are awake- <br />Assail our minds, to such degree indeed <br />That we do seem to see for sure the man <br />Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained <br />Dominion over. And nature forces this <br />To come to pass because the body's senses <br />Are resting, thwarted through the members all, <br />Unable now to conquer false with true; <br />And memory lies prone and languishes <br />In slumber, nor protests that he, the man <br />Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since <br />Hath been the gain of death and dissolution. <br /> And further, 'tis no marvel idols move <br />And toss their arms and other members round <br />In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps <br />It haps an image this is seen to do; <br />In sooth, when perishes the former image, <br />And other is gendered of another pose, <br />That former seemeth to have changed its gestures. <br />Of course the change must be conceived as speedy; <br />So great the swiftness and so great the store <br />Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief <br />As mind can mark) so great, again, the store <br />Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies. <br /> It happens also that there is supplied <br />Sometimes an image not of kind the same; <br />But what before was woman, now at hand <br />Is seen to stand there, altered into male; <br />Or other visage, other age succeeds; <br />But slumber and oblivion take care <br />That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.</p>                        </div>

For from sky <br />These breathing-creatures never can have dropped, <br />Nor the land-dwellers ever have come up <br />Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains, <br />How merited is that adopted name <br />Of earth- The Mother!- since from out the earth <br />Are all begotten. And even now arise <br />From out the loams how many living things- <br />Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun. <br />Wherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang <br />In Long Ago more many, and more big, <br />Matured of those days in the fresh young years <br />Of earth and ether. First of all, the race <br />Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds, <br />Hatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind; <br />As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets <br />Do leave their shiny husks of own accord, <br />Seeking their food and living. Then it was <br />This earth of thine first gave unto the day <br />The mortal generations; for prevailed <br />Among the fields abounding hot and wet. <br />And hence, where any fitting spot was given, <br />There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots <br />Affixed to earth. And when in ripened time <br />The age of the young within (that sought the air <br />And fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then <br />Would Nature thither turn the pores of earth <br />And make her spurt from open veins a juice <br />Like unto milk; even as a woman now <br />Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk, <br />Because all that swift stream of aliment <br />Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts. <br />There earth would furnish to the children food; <br />Warmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed <br />Abounding in soft down. <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>'s newness then <br />Would rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold, <br />Nor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers- <br />For all things grow and gather strength through time <br />In like proportions; and then earth was young.</p>                        </div>

What sun and rains <br />To them had given, what earth of own accord <br />Created then, was boon enough to glad <br />Their simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks <br />Would they refresh their bodies for the nonce; <br />And the wild berries of the arbute-tree, <br />Which now thou seest to ripen purple-red <br />In winter time, the old telluric soil <br />Would bear then more abundant and more big. <br />And many coarse foods, too, in long ago <br />The blooming freshness of the rank young world <br />Produced, enough for those poor wretches there. <br />And rivers and springs would summon them of old <br />To slake the thirst, as now from the great hills <br />The water's down-rush calls aloud and far <br />The thirsty generations of the wild. <br />So, too, they sought the grottos of the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>- <br />The woodland haunts discovered as they ranged- <br />From forth of which they knew that gliding rills <br />With gush and splash abounding laved the rocks, <br />The dripping rocks, and trickled from above <br />Over the verdant moss; and here and there <br />Welled up and burst across the open flats. <br />As yet they knew not to enkindle fire <br />Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use <br />And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts; <br />But huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods, <br />And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs, <br />When driven to flee the lashings of the winds <br />And the big rains. Nor could they then regard <br />The general good, nor did they know to use <br />In common any customs, any laws: <br />Whatever of booty fortune unto each <br />Had proffered, each alone would bear away, <br />By instinct trained for self to thrive and live. <br />And <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> in the forests then would link <br />The lovers' bodies; for the woman yielded <br />Either from mutual flame, or from the man's <br />Impetuous fury and insatiate lust, <br />Or from a bribe- as acorn-nuts, choice pears, <br />Or the wild berries of the arbute-tree. <br />And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs, <br />They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts; <br />And many they'd conquer, but some few they fled, <br />A-skulk into their hiding-places... <br /> . . . . . . <br />With the flung stones and with the ponderous heft <br />Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night <br />O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boars</a>, <br />Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth, <br />Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs. <br />Nor would they call with lamentations loud <br />Around the fields for daylight and the sun, <br />Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night; <br />But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait <br />Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought <br />The glory to the sky. From childhood wont <br />Ever to see the dark and day begot <br />In times alternate, never might they be <br />Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night <br />Eternal should possess the lands, with light <br />Of sun withdrawn forever. But their care <br />Was rather that the clans of savage beasts <br />Would often make their sleep-time horrible <br />For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven, <br />They'd flee their rocky shelters at approach <br />Of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, the spumy-lipped, or <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> strong, <br />And in the midnight yield with terror up <br />To those fierce guests their beds of out-spread leaves.</p>                        </div>

So again, we see <br />All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings <br />And from their fledgling pinions seek to get <br />A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think <br />That in those days some man apportioned round <br />To things their names, and that from him men learned <br />Their first nomenclature, is foolery. <br />For why could he mark everything by words <br />And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time <br />The rest may be supposed powerless <br />To do the same?

And this, forsooth, <br />'Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first <br />Huge flabby jowls of mad <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=person long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossian</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, <br />Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl, <br />They threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back, <br />In sounds far other than with which they bark <br />And fill with voices all the regions round. <br />And when with fondling tongue they start to lick <br />Their <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a>, or do toss them round with paws, <br />Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap, <br />They fawn with yelps of voice far other then <br />Than when, alone within the house, they bay, <br />Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows. <br />Again the neighing of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, is that <br />Not seen to differ likewise, when the stud <br />In buoyant flower of his young years raves, <br />Goaded by winged <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a>, amongst the mares, <br />And when with widening nostrils out he snorts <br />The call to battle, and when haply he <br />Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs? <br />Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds, <br />Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life <br />Amid the ocean billows in the brine, <br />Utter at other times far other cries <br />Than when they fight for food, or with their prey <br />Struggle and strain.

Lo, <br />What man is there whose mind with dread of gods <br />Cringes not close, whose limbs with terror-spell <br />Crouch not together, when the parched earth <br />Quakes with the horrible thunderbolt amain, <br />And across the mighty sky the rumblings run? <br />Do not the peoples and the nations shake, <br />And haughty kings do they not hug their limbs, <br />Strook through with fear of the divinities, <br />Lest for aught foully done or madly said <br />The heavy time be now at hand to pay? <br />When, too, fierce force of fury-winds at sea <br />Sweepeth a navy's admiral down the main <br />With his stout legions and his elephants, <br />Doth he not seek the peace of gods with vows, <br />And beg in prayer, a-tremble, lulled winds <br />And friendly gales?- in vain, since, often up-caught <br />In fury-cyclones, is he borne along, <br />For all his mouthings, to the shoals of doom. <br />Ah, so irrevocably some hidden power <br />Betramples forevermore affairs of men, <br />And visibly grindeth with its heel in mire <br />The lictors' glorious rods and axes dire, <br />Having them in derision! Again, when earth <br />From end to end is rocking under foot, <br />And shaken cities ruin down, or threaten <br />Upon the verge, what wonder is it then <br />That mortal generations abase themselves, <br />And unto gods in all affairs of earth <br />Assign as last resort almighty powers <br />And wondrous energies to govern all?</p>                        </div>

And he proved <br />That mostly vainly doth the human race <br />Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care. <br />For just as children tremble and fear all <br />In the viewless dark, so even we at times <br />Dread in the light so many things that be <br />No whit more fearsome than what children feign, <br />Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark. <br />This terror then, this darkness of the mind, <br />Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light, <br />Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse, <br />But only nature's aspect and her law. <br />Wherefore the more will I go on to weave <br />In verses this my undertaken task.</p>                        </div>

Thereafter, when <br />The energy of wind is heated through <br />And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped <br />Deeply within, O then the thunderbolt, <br />Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly <br />Splinter the cloud, and the aroused flash <br />Leaps onward, lumining with forky light <br />All places round. And followeth anon <br />A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults, <br />As if asunder burst, seem from on high <br />To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake <br />Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies <br />Run the far rumblings. For at such a time <br />Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through, <br />And roused are the roarings,- from which shock <br />Comes such resounding and abounding rain, <br />That all the murky ether seems to turn <br />Now into rain, and, as it tumbles down, <br />To summon the fields back to primeval floods: <br />So big the rains that be sent down on men <br />By burst of cloud and by the hurricane, <br />What time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt <br />That cracks the cloud, flies forth along.

And many a walled town, <br />Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent <br />Convulsions on the land, and in the sea <br />Engulfed hath sunken many a city down <br />With all its populace. But if, indeed, <br />They burst not forth, yet is the very rush <br />Of the wild air and fury-force of wind <br />Then dissipated, like an ague-fit, <br />Through the innumerable pores of earth, <br />To set her all a-shake- even as a chill, <br />When it hath gone into our marrow-bones, <br />Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves, <br />A-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men <br />With two-fold terror bustle in alarm <br />Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs <br />Above the head; and underfoot they dread <br />The caverns, lest the nature of the earth <br />Suddenly rend them open, and she gape, <br />Herself asunder, with tremendous maw, <br />And, all confounded, seek to chock it full <br />With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on <br />Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be <br />Inviolable, entrusted evermore <br />To an eternal weal: and yet at times <br />The very force of danger here at hand <br />Prods them on some side with this goad of fear- <br />This among others- that the earth, withdrawn <br />Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down, <br />Down into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things <br />Be following after, utterly fordone, <br />Till be but wrack and wreckage of a world. <br /> . . . . . . <br />EXTRAORDINARY AND PARADOXICAL TELLURIC PHENOMENA <br /> In chief, men marvel nature renders not <br />Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since <br />So vast the down-rush of the waters be, <br />And every river out of every realm <br />Cometh thereto; and add the random rains <br />And flying tempests, which spatter every sea <br />And every land bedew; add their own springs: <br />Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum <br />Shall be but as the increase of a drop. <br />Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea, <br />The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides, <br />Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part: <br />Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams <br />To dry our garments dripping all with wet; <br />And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath, <br />Do we behold. Therefore, however slight <br />The portion of wet that sun on any spot <br />Culls from the level main, he still will take <br />From off the waves in such a wide expanse <br />Abundantly. Then, further, also winds, <br />Sweeping the level waters, can bear off <br />A mighty part of wet, since we behold <br />Oft in a single night the highways dried <br />By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn. <br />Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off <br />Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches <br />Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about <br />O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands <br />And winds convey the aery racks of vapour. <br />Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame, <br />And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores, <br />The water's wet must seep into the lands <br />From briny ocean, as from lands it comes <br />Into the seas. For brine is filtered off, <br />And then the liquid stuff seeps back again <br />And all re-poureth at the river-heads, <br />Whence in fresh-water currents it returns <br />Over the lands, adown the channels which <br />Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along <br />The liquid-footed floods.</p>                        </div>

And, lo, all <br />That Influence of bane, that pestilence, <br />Or from Beyond down through our atmosphere, <br />Like clouds and mists, descends, or else collects <br />From earth herself and rises, when, a-soak <br />And beat by rains unseasonable and suns, <br />Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot. <br />Seest thou not, also, that whoso arrive <br />In region far from fatherland and home <br />Are by the strangeness of the clime and waters <br />Distempered?- since conditions vary much. <br />For in what else may we suppose the clime <br />Among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=ethnic long=-1.5 lat=53>Britons</a> to differ from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Aegypt</a>'s own <br />(Where totters awry the axis of the world), <br />Or in what else to differ <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> clime <br />From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=place long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gades</a>' and from climes adown the south, <br />On to black generations of strong men <br />With sun-baked skins? Even as we thus do see <br />Four climes diverse under the four main-winds <br />And under the four main-regions of the sky, <br />So, too, are seen the colour and face of men <br />Vastly to disagree, and fixed diseases <br />To seize the generations, kind by kind: <br />There is the elephant-disease which down <br />In midmost <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Aegypt</a>, hard by streams of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, <br />Engendered is- and never otherwhere. <br />In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> the feet are oft attacked, <br />And in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=demonym long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaean</a> lands the eyes. And so <br />The divers spots to divers parts and limbs <br />Are noxious; 'tis a variable air <br />That causes this. Thus when an atmosphere, <br />Alien by chance to us, begins to heave, <br />And noxious airs begin to crawl along, <br />They creep and wind like unto mist and cloud, <br />Slowly, and everything upon their way <br />They disarrange and force to change its state. <br />It happens, too, that when they've come at last <br />Into this atmosphere of ours, they taint <br />And make it like themselves and alien. <br />Therefore, asudden this devastation strange, <br />This pestilence, upon the waters falls, <br />Or settles on the very crops of grain <br />Or other meat of men and feed of flocks. <br />Or it remains a subtle force, suspense <br />In the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom <br />We draw our inhalations of mixed air, <br />Into our body equally its bane <br />Also we must suck in. In manner like, <br />Oft comes the pestilence upon the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>, <br />And sickness, too, upon the sluggish <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>. <br />Nor aught it matters whether journey we <br />To regions adverse to ourselves and change <br />The atmospheric cloak, or whether nature <br />Herself import a tainted atmosphere <br />To us or something strange to our own use <br />Which can attack us soon as ever it come. <br /> THE PLAGUE ATHENS <br /> 'Twas such a manner of disease, 'twas such <br />Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands <br />Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones, <br />Unpeopled the highways, drained of citizens <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> town. For coming from afar, <br />Rising in lands of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Aegypt</a>, traversing <br />Reaches of air and floating fields of foam, <br />At last on all <a href=/people/507 target=_blank>Pandion</a>'s folk it swooped; <br />Whereat by troops unto disease and death <br />Were they o'er-given. At first, they'd bear about <br />A skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain <br />Red with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats, <br />Black on the inside, sweated oozy blood; <br />And the walled pathway of the voice of man <br />Was clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue, <br />The mind's interpreter, would trickle gore, <br />Weakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch. <br />Next when that Influence of bane had chocked, <br />Down through the throat, the breast, and streamed had <br />E'en into sullen heart of those sick folk, <br />Then, verily, all the fences of man's life <br />Began to topple. From the mouth the breath <br />Would roll a noisome stink, as stink to heaven <br />Rotting cadavers flung unburied out. <br />And, lo, thereafter, all the body's strength <br />And every power of mind would languish, now <br />In very doorway of destruction. <br />And anxious anguish and ululation (mixed <br />With many a groan) companioned alway <br />The intolerable torments. Night and day, <br />Recurrent spasms of vomiting would rack <br />Alway their thews and members, breaking down <br />With sheer exhaustion men already spent. <br />And yet on no one's body couldst thou mark <br />The skin with o'er-much heat to burn aglow, <br />But rather the body unto touch of hands <br />Would offer a warmish feeling, and thereby <br />Show red all over, with ulcers, so to say, <br />Inbranded, like the sacred fires o'erspread <br />Along the members. The inward parts of men, <br />In truth, would blaze unto the very bones; <br />A flame, like flame in furnaces, would blaze <br />Within the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply <br />Unto their members light enough and thin <br />For shift of aid- but coolness and a breeze <br />Ever and ever. Some would plunge those limbs <br />On fire with bane into the icy streams, <br />Hurling the body naked into the waves; </p>                        </div>
