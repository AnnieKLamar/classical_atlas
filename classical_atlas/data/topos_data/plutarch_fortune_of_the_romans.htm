                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg086:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many warm disputes which have often happened between <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, this concerning the Roman empire is none of the least considerable, whether of them shall have the honor of founding that empire at first, and raising it afterwards to vast power and glory. The victory in this cause will be no small commendation of the conqueror, and will sufficiently vindicate either of the contending parties from the allegations that are usually made against it. For <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> is accused as unprofitable, though beautiful, and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> as unstable, though good; the former as laboring in vain, the latter as deceitful in its gifts. But who can deny but <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> has been most profitable, if <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> does favor her cause in this contention, since she procured so much good to brave and gallant men; or that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> is most constant, if she be victorious in this contest, since she continued her gifts with the Romans for so long a time? <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> the poet has written somewhere in prose, that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> and <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, though they be very much different from one another, are nevertheless the causes of the very same effects. Both of them do advance and adorn men; both do raise them to glory, power, and empire. It were needless to multiply instances by a long enumeration of particulars, when even Nature itself, which produces all things, is by some reputed <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, and by others <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>. And therefore the present controversy will conciliate great honor and veneration to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, since she is thought worthy of the same enquiry which uses to be made concerning the earth and seas, the heavens and the stars, — whether she owes her being to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> or to Providence. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg086:2'><b>&sect; 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In which question, I think it may be truly affirmed that, notwithstanding the fierce and lasting wars which have been between <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, they did both amicably conspire to rear up the structure of her vast empire and power, and join their united endeavors to finish the most beautiful work that ever was of human production. It was the opinion of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, that the whole world was composed of fire and earth, as necessary first principles, which being mixed together did render it visible and tangible, — the earth contributing weight and firmness, while the fire gave color, form, and motion to the several parts of matter; but for the tempering and union of these extremes, he thought it necessary that the water and air, being of a middle nature, should mitigate and rebate the contrary force by composition. After the same manner did God and Time, who laid the foundations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, conjoin and mingle <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> together, that by the union of their several powers, they might compose a <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>, truly sacred and beneficent to all men, which should be a firm stay, an eternal support, and a steady anchor (as <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> calls it) amidst the fluctuating and uncertain affairs of human life. For as naturalists say, that the world was not framed at first into that beautiful order and structure in which we now behold it, nor would these several bodies that compose it unite and mix so that Nature might receive a common form by their union, but that all things did fluctuate a long while in confusion and crashing, — whilst some bodies were still small and variously moved, and slipped and avoided all seizure and connections, and others which were greater and already compacted, being of contrary natures, did frequently justle and jar one against another, — and that all was full of destruction and confusion and wreck, until such time as the earth, being framed of them both in its due magnitude, was established in its proper place, and by its stability gave occasion to all the other bodies of the universe either to settle upon it or round about it; just so it happened to the greatest kingdoms and empires of men, which were long tossed with various changes and broken in pieces by mutual clashings. And for want of one supreme ruler over all, while all aspired to rule, the world was filled with unspeakable violence, confusion, and revolution in all things, until such time as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was raised to its just strength and greatness, which, comprehending under her power many strange nations and even transmarine dominions, did lay the foundation of firmness and stability to the greatest of human affairs; for by this vast compass of one and the same empire, government was secured as in an unmovable circle, resting upon the centre of peace. Whosoever therefore contrived and compassed these great designs must not only have been endowed with all virtues, but likewise have been assisted by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> in many things; as will plainly appear from the following discourse. </p>                        </div>

No, she does not appear here in any such doubtful and uncertain posture; but as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> say that <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, when she passed over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224WEur class=place long=22.427 lat=37.093>Eurotas</a>, put off her gewgaws and female ornaments, and armed herself with spear and shield for the sake of <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>; so <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, having deserted the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, did swiftly fly over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and quickly threw off her favorite <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, and after that, having passed through the countries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and oftentimes by turns supported the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, she did at last fly over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> Mount, and there she put off her wings, her Mercurial shoes, and left her slippery and deceitful globe. Thus she entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as one that was to be resident there, and thus she comes to the bar in this controversy. She is no more uncertain, as <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> describes her; she does not henceforth guide a double helm, but continues constant to the Romans, and therefore may be called the sister of <a href=/people/3513 target=_blank>Eunomia</a> and <a href=/people/656 target=_blank>Persuasion</a>, and the daughter of Providence, as <a href=/people/769 target=_blank>Alcman</a> describes her pedigree. This is certain in the opinion of all men, that she holds in her hand the Horn of Plenty, not that which is filled with verdant fruits, but that which pours forth abundance of all things which the earth or the sea, the rivers or the metals, or the harbors afford.

For the temple of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> was but lately built by <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> Numantinus, a long time after the building of the city. And after that, <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> dedicated a temple to <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> and Honor; and <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, who lived in the time of the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbrian</a> war, founded another to the Mind, when now, by the subtilties of sophists and encomiastics of orators, these things began to be mightily extolled. And to this very day there is no temple built to <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, nor to Temperance, Patience, Magnanimity, or Continence. On the contrary, the temples dedicated to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> are splendid and ancient, almost as old as the first foundations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself. The first that built her a temple was <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus Marcius</a>, born of the sister of <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, being the third king from <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>; and he seems to have made <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> surname to Fortitude, to which she contributes very much for obtaining victory. The Romans built the temple of Feminine <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> before the time of <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, when by the help of the women they turned back <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/2734 target=_blank>Coriolanus</a>, leading up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volsci</a> against the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; for the women being sent ambassadors to him, together with his mother and wife, prevailed with the man to spare the city at that time and to draw off the army of the barbarians. It is said that this statue of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, when it was consecrated, uttered these words: It was piously done, O ye city matrons, to dedicate me by the law of your state. But (which is more remarkable) <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, having quenched the flame of the Gallic war, and rescued <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from the balance and scales in which her price was weighed to them in gold, did not upon this occasion found a temple to <a href=/people/2872 target=_blank>Prudence</a> and Fortitude, but to Fame and Presage; which he built hard by the New Way, in that very place where (it is said) Marcus <a href=/people/4907 target=_blank>Caedicius</a> walking in the night-time heard a prophetical voice, commanding him shortly to expect a war from the Gauls. And the <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> whose temple is near the river they call Fortis (that is, stout, or valiant, or manly), as having the power of conquering all things. And her temple is built in those very gardens which were left by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> as a legacy to the people, because they thought that he also was raised to the height of power by the favor of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>. </p>                        </div>

But when he saw the pilot began to change his purpose of putting out to sea, because of the violence of the waves, which hindered the sailing out at the mouth of the river, he presently plucked off the disguise from his head and showed himself, encouraging the pilot in these words: Put on, brave fellow, and fear nothing, but commit the sails to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, and expose all boldly to the winds; for thou carriest <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s fortune.

And first of all, it cannot be denied that, by the birth and preservation of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, by his education and growth, the foundations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were first laid by <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>; but then withal it must be acknowledged that <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> finished the building. As to their origin and birth who first founded and built the city, it looked like a wonderful good <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>. For it is said that their mother conceived by a God; and as <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> is said to have been sown in a long night, the natural day being preternaturally prolonged by the sun's standing still; so it is reported concerning the begetting of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, that the sun was eclipsed at the time, being in conjunction with the moon, as the immortal God <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> was with the mortal Sylvia. The same is said to have happened about the time of his death. For on the seventh of July, called Nonae Capratinae, which is a feast observed to this day with great solemnity, while the sun was under an eclipse, he suddenly vanished out of the sight of men. After their nativity, when the tyrant would have murdered the new-born babes, by the conduct of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, who was concerned for the preservation of their lives, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> fell into the hands of a servant no ways barbarous and cruel, but pitiful and tender-hearted, who laid them on the pleasant green bank of a river, in a place shaded with lowly shrubs, near to that wild fig-tree, to which the name of <a href=/people/8251 target=_blank>Ruminalis</a> was afterwards given. There it was that a she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, having lost her young whelps, by chance lighted on them, and being burdened with her swollen dugs, inflamed for want of evacuation, she gladly let out her overheated milk, as if it had been a second birth, and suckled the young children. The woodpecker also, a bird sacred to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, came often unto them, and supporting herself upon one claw, she did by turns open both their mouths with the other, and distribute unto each of them convenient gobbets of her own food. This fig-tree was therefore called <a href=/people/8251 target=_blank>Ruminalis</a>, from Ruma, the dug, which the <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> lying down there gave to the infants. And from a veneration of this strange chance of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and of every thing resembling it, the inhabitants thereabout would not expose any of their offspring; but they carefully reared and fostered all new births. Above all things, the hidden craft of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> appeared in their education at the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419127UGab class=place long=12.7173 lat=41.8871>Gabii</a>; for there they were secretly nursed and brought up, and the people knew nothing of their pedigree, that they were the sons of Sylvia and the grandchildren of king <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>; which seems to be so ordered on purpose to prevent that untimely death which the knowledge of their royal race would occasion, and to give them opportunity of showing themselves hereafter by their famous exploits, and discovering the nobility of their extraction by their heroical actions. And this brings to my mind the saying of that great and wise commander <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> to some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> captains, who, having followed him in the wars with good success, were grown ambitious to be preferred above him. There was an eager contest, said he, between the festival day and the day following, for precedency. Thou, says the following day, art full of tumult and business, but I give men the peaceful opportunity of enjoying themselves. Ay, says the festival, that's true; but then, I pray you, tell me, if I had not been, where had you been? So, says <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>, if I had not preserved my country in the war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, what use would there be of you now? And after this manner <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> seems to accost the virtue of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>: it is true indeed, your actions are great and famous, by which you have clearly shown that you are descended of the race of the Gods. But see now how far you come behind me. For if I had not relieved the infants in their distress by my bounty and humanity, if I had deserted and betrayed them when they lay naked and exposed, how could you have appeared with such lustre and splendor as now you do? If a she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> had not then lighted upon them, inflamed with the abundance and pressure of her milk, which wanted one to give food unto more than any food for herself; if some wild beast had happened to come in her stead, hungry and ravaging for meat; then there had been no such beautiful and stately palaces, temples, theatres, walks, courts, and forum, as now you justly glory of; then your followers had still been shepherds, and your buildings cottages or stables, and they had still lived in subjection to the Albanian, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a>, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> lords. Certainly the first beginning of all things is of greatest importance, and more especially in building of a city. But it was <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> that first gave a beginning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, by preserving the founder of it in so many dangers to which he was exposed. For as <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> made <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> great, so <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> preserved him till his virtue did appear. </p>                        </div>

For as a great ship or galley is not made without many blows, and much force from hammers, nails, wedges, saws, and axes, and being once built, it must rest for some time upon the stocks, until the bands of its structure grow strong and tenacious, and the nails be well fastened which hold its parts together, lest, being launched while it is loose and unsettled, the hulk should be shattered by the concussion of the waves and let in the water, — so the first artificer of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, having built the city of rustical men and shepherds, as on strong foundations, was forced to endure hard labor and maintain dangerous wars against those who opposed its first origination and institution; but after it was once framed and compacted by this force, the second artificer, by the benignity of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, gave it so long rest and peace, till all its parts were consolidated and settled in a firm and lasting posture. But if at that time, when the city was newly built, some <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> had advanced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscan</a> camp and army to the walls, being yet moist and trembling, or some warlike revolter of the <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsian</a> grandees, or some envious and contentious <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=demonym long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanian</a>, such as in latter times were Mutius or the bold Silo, or the last plague of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sylla</a>'s faction, <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, who with one alarm armed all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, — if any of these, I say, had encompassed the philosopher <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> with the sound of trumpets, while he was sacrificing and praying to the Gods, the city being yet unsettled and unfinished, he could never have resisted so great a torrent and tempest, nor increased unto so great numbers of stout and valiant men. That long time of peace therefore in <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>'s reign did prepare and fortify the Romans against all the wars which happened afterwards; for by its continuance, during the space of forty-three years, the body of the people was confirmed in that athletic habit which they acquired in the war under <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, and which generally prevailed henceforward against all their enemies. For in these years they say <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was not afflicted with famine or pestilence, with barrenness of the earth, or any notable calamity by winter or summer; all which must be attributed, not to human prudence, but to the good conduct of divine <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> governing for that time. Then the double <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SJan class=place long=12.4851 lat=41.8933>gate</a> of <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> was shut, which they call the gate of war, because it is always opened in time of war and shut in time of peace. After <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>'s death, it was opened again when the war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=ethnic long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Albans</a> commenced, which was followed with other wars without number in a continued series of time; but after four hundred and eighty years, it was shut again when peace was concluded at the end of the first Punic war, in the consulship of Caius <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a> and Titus <a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a>. The next year it was opened again, and the wars lasted until the victory which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> obtained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390208SAkt class=place long=20.7683 lat=38.9509>Actium</a>. Then the Roman arms rested but a little while; for the tumults from <a href=/people/12072 target=_blank>Cantabria</a> and the wars with the Gauls and Germans breaking in upon them quickly disturbed the peace. These things I have added to explain this argument of the good fortune of <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>. </p>                        </div>

For proof of this, we may consider that the temple of <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was but lately built, many years after the beginning of the city, by that <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> who took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>. There is also a temple dedicated to the Mind, or rather to good counsel, called <a href=/people/7963 target=_blank>Mens</a>, by <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a>, who lived in the time of the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbrian</a> war, when the arms of rhetoric and the sophistry of logic had crept into the city. And even to this day, there are no temples built to <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, Temperance, Patience, and Magnanimity; but the temples of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> are very ancient and splendid, adorned with all sorts of honors, and divided amongst the most famous parts and places of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. The temple of Manly <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> was built by <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus Marcius</a>, the fourth king; which name was therefore given it, because <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> does contribute very much to valor in obtaining victory. The temple of Feminine <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> was consecrated by the matrons, when they drove away <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> <a href=/people/2734 target=_blank>Coriolanus</a> at the head of an army marching against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as everybody knows. Moreover, <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>, who above all the kings did most enlarge the power of the people and adorn the commonwealth, who first established a good order for the giving of suffrages and for the good discipline of the militia, who was the first censor and overseer of men's lives and sobriety, and is esteemed a most wise and valiant man, — even he threw himself upon <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, and owned his kingdom to be derived from her. So great was her kindness to him, that she is thought to have descended into his house by a gateway (which is now called Fenestella) and there to have conversed familiarly with him. Upon which account he built two temples to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, one to that which is called Primogenia in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, i. e. the first born, as one may expound it; another to that which is called Obsequens, which some interpret as being obsequious to his desires, and others as mild and gentle. I will henceforth leave the Roman names, and endeavor to reckon up and interpret in Greek the meaning of these temples. There is the sanctuary of Private <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> (Ἰδίας Τύχης ἱερόν) on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a>, and that of Sticky/Birdlime (Ἰξευτρίας); which name, though it seems ridiculous, does by a metaphor explain to us the nature of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, that she attracts things at a distance, and retains them when they are brought to contact. At the fountain which is called Mossy (Μουσκῶσαν) the sanctuary of Virgin <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> (Παρθένου Τύχης ἱερόν) is still to be seen; and that of Regardful <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> (Ἐπιστρεφομένης, turning-round) in Aiskylia (the Esquiline?). There is an altar also to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> of Good <a href=/people/1068 target=_blank>Hope</a> (Εὐέλπιδος) in the long narrow street; and near to the altar of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> Epitalaria (Foot-winged) there is a chapel to Male <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> (Ἀφροδίτης Ἐπιταλαρίου βωμὸν Ἄρρενος Τύχης). Infinite are the honors and titles of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, the greater part of which were instituted by <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, who knew that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> is of great weight — nay, is every thing — in all human affairs, and more especially had found by experience that by her favor he was preferred from a captive and hostile nation to be king of the Romans. For when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420127UCor class=place long=12.74281 lat=42.02348>Corniculum</a> was taken by the Romans, the virgin <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> being taken at the same time, she for her illustrious beauty and virtue (which the meanness of her fortune could not hide or obscure) was presented to <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a>, the consort of King <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a>, with whom she served till she was married to one of the retainers whom the Romans call clients; and of them was born <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. Others tell the story after this manner: that the virgin <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> using often to receive the first-fruits and libations from the royal table, which were to be offered in sacrifice, it happened on a time that when, according to the custom, she had thrown them into the fire, upon the sudden expiration of the flame, there appeared to come out of it the genital member of a man. The virgin, being frighted with so strange a sight, told the whole matter to Queen <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a>; who, being a wise and understanding woman, judged the vision to be divine, and therefore dressed up the virgin in all her bridal ornaments and attire, and then shut her up in a room together with this apparition. Some attribute this amour to Lar the household God, and others to <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>; but whichsoever it was, <a href=/people/4630 target=_blank>Ocresia</a> was with child, and gave birth to <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. And while he was yet an infant, his head was seen to send forth a wonderful brightness, like lightning darted from the skies. But <a href=/people/10947 target=_blank>Antias</a> tells this story after a different manner: that when <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>'s wife Getania was dead, he fell into a sleep through grief and dejection of mind, in the presence of his mother, and then his head was seen by the woman encompassed by fire; which, as it was a certain token that he was born of fire, so was a good omen of that unexpected kingdom which he obtained after the death of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>, by the means of <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a>. This is so much the more to be wondered at, because he of all kings seems to have been least fitted by Nature and most averse by inclination to monarchical government; since he would have resigned his kingdom and divested himself of regal authority, if he had not been hindered by the oath which it appears he made to <a href=/people/3257 target=_blank>Tanaquil</a> when she was dying, that he should continue during his life in kingly power, and never change that form of government which he had received from his ancestors. Thus the reign of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> was wholly owing to <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, because he both received it beside his expectation, and retained it against his will. </p>                        </div>

And first of all it must be confessed that the boldness and courage which are necessary for war do aid and improve military virtue, as <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> says; and yet it is manifest to him that will reason aright, that the abundance of success which advanced the Roman Empire to such vast power and greatness is not to be attributed to human strength and counsels, but to a certain divine impulse and a full gale of running <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, which carried all before it that hindered the rising glory of the Romans. For now trophies were erected upon trophies, and triumphs hastened to meet one another; before the blood was cold upon their arms, it was washed off with the fresh blood of their falling enemies. Henceforth the victories were not reckoned by the numbers of the slain or the greatness of the spoils, but by the kingdoms that were taken, by the nations that were conquered, by the isles and continents which were added to the vastness of their empire. At one battle <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> was forced to quit all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, by one stroke <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was beaten out of Asia, by one victory the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> lost <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>; but which is yet more wonderful, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> sea, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407465RAlb class=ethnic long=46.5 lat=40.7>Albanians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420435RIbe class=ethnic long=43.5 lat=42>Iberians</a>, with all the regions as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=ethnic long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcanians</a>, were by one man and the success of one expedition reduced under the power of the Roman Empire. The Ocean, which environs the whole earth, beheld him thrice victorious; for he subdued the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> in Africa, as far as the southern shores; he conquered Spain, which joined in the madness of <a href=/people/221 target=_blank>Sertorius</a>, as far as the <a href=/people/770 target=_blank>Atlantic</a> Ocean; and he pursued the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407465RAlb class=demonym long=46.5 lat=40.7>Albanian</a> kings as far as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=place long=51.6 lat=40>Caspian sea</a>. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius Magnus</a>, one and the same man, achieved all those great and stupendous things, by the assistance of that public <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> which waited upon the Roman arms with success; and after all this, he sank under the weight of his own fatal greatness. The great Genius of the Romans was not propitious for a day only, or for a little time, like that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>; it was not powerful by land only, like that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconians</a>, or by sea only, like that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. It was not too slowly sensible of injuries, as that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, nor too easily pacified, like that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=ethnic long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophonians</a>; but from the beginning growing up with the city, the more it increased, the more it enlarged the empire, and constantly aided the Romans with its auspicious influence by sea and land, in peace and war, against all their enemies, whether Greeks or barbarians. It was this Genius which dissipated <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a> the Carthaginian, when he broke in upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> like a torrent, and the people could give no assistance, being torn in pieces by intestine jars. It was this Genius that separated the two armies of the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> and <a href=/people/4314 target=_blank>Teutones</a>, that they should not meet at the same time and place; by which means <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> the Roman general encountered each army by itself, and overcame them; which, if they had been joined together, would have overflowed all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> like a deluge, with three hundred thousand valiant men, invincible in arms. It was the same Genius that hindered <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> by other occasions from assisting <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> while he was engaged in war with the Romans; so that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was first vanquished while <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was still in danger. It was by the conduct of the same Genius that <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> was taken up with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=demonym long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatic</a> and <a href=/people/1286 target=_blank>Bastarnic</a> wars while the <a href=/people/1401 target=_blank>Marsians</a> attacked <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; that jealousy and envy divided <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a> from <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> while the latter was flushed with success; but both of them were joined together in the defeat, that they might perish in the same common ruin. </p>                        </div>

Has not <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> relieved the city, when it was reduced to the greatest extremity of danger? When the Gauls encamped about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> and besieged the castle, And heaped the camp with mountains of the dead, did not <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> and chance discover their secret attack in the night-time, which otherwise had surprised all men? Of which wonderful accident it will not be unseasonable to discourse here a little more largely. After the great overthrow and slaughter of the Romans at the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125WAli class=place long=12.5207 lat=42.0177>Allia</a>, some of those that remained fled hastily to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and communicated their terror and consternation to the people there. Some trussed up their bag and baggage and conveyed themselves into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, resolving there to wait the event of so dismal a calamity; others flocked in great multitudes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420124UVei class=place long=12.3897 lat=42.0233>Veii</a>, and there proclaimed <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> dictator, giving him now in their distress an absolute and unaccountable power, whom before in their pride and prosperity they had condemned and banished, as guilty of robbing the public treasure. But <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, to strengthen his title to this authority, which might seem to be given him only for the present necessity, contrary to the law of the state touching the election of such a magistrate, scorned to accept an election from a body of armed soldiers, so lately shattered and beaten, as if the government of the city were dissolved; but sent to acquaint the senators that were in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, and know if they would approve the election of the soldiers. To accomplish this, there was one C. <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a>, who undertook to carry the news of this decree to those in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, though it was with great danger of his life; for he was to go through the midst of the enemies, who were entrenched and kept watch about the castle. He came therefore in the night-time to the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and by the help of broad corks supporting the weight of his body, he was carried down the stream in a smooth calm water, and safely landed on the other side. From thence he passed through places uninhabited, being conducted by darkness and silence, to the rock of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>; and climbing up through its winding and rough passages, with much labor and difficulty at last he arrived at the summit, where, being received by the watch, he acquainted the senators with what was done by the soldiers, and having received their approbation of the decree of election, he returned again to <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>. The next day after, one of the barbarians by chance walking about this rock, and seeing in one place the prints of his feet and his falls, in another place the grass trodden down which grew upon the interspersed earth, and the plain marks of his body in its winding ascent through the craggy precipice, went presently and informed the rest of the Gauls of the whole matter. They, finding that a way was shown them by the enemy, resolved to follow his footsteps; and taking the advantage of the dead time of the night, when all were fast asleep, not so much as a watch stirring or a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> barking, they climbed up secretly to the castle. But <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> in this case was wonderfully propitious to the Romans, in discovering and preventing such an imminent danger by the voice of the sacred geese, which were maintained about the temple of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> for the worship of that Goddess. For that animal being wakeful by nature and easily frighted with the least noise, these sacred geese had been so much neglected by reason of the scarcity of provisions which was in the castle, that they were more easily wakened by the approach of the enemy out of their light and hungry sleep. Therefore they presently perceived the Gauls appearing upon the walls, and with a loud voice flew proudly towards them; but being yet more frightened with the sight of their shining armor, they raised a louder gaggling noise, which wakened the Romans; who understanding the design, presently beat back the enemies, and threw them down over the precipices of the rock. Therefore, in remembrance of this wonderful accident, a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> fastened to a cross, and a goose lying in a bed of state upon a rich cushion, are carried about, even to this day, in pompous solemnity. And now who is not astonished that considers how great the misery of the city was at that time, and how great its happiness is now at this day, when he beholds the splendor and riches of its donatives, the emulation of liberal arts that flourish in it, the accession of noble cities and royal crowns to its empire, and the chief products of sea and land, of isles and continents, of rivers and trees, of animals and fields, of mountains and metallic mines, crowding to adorn and beautify this place? Who is not stunned with admiration at the imminent danger which then was, whether ever those things should be or no; and at those poor timorous birds, which first began the deliverance of the city, when all places were filled with fire, darkness, and smoke, with the swords of barbarians and bloody-minded men? What a prodigy of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> was it that those great commanders, the Manlii, the Servii, Postumii, and <a href=/people/8099 target=_blank>Papirii</a>, so famous for their warlike exploits and for the illustrious families that have descended from them, should be alarmed in this extremity of danger by the silly geese, to fight for their country's God and their country? And if that be true which <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> writes in his second book of those Gauls which then possessed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, — that they made a peace with <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> and departed, as soon as they heard the news of the invasion that was made upon their territories by the neighboring barbarians, — then it is past all controversy, that <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> was the cause of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>'s preservation by drawing off the enemies to another place, or rather forcing them from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> beyond all men's expectation. </p>                        </div>

For those things which happened in following ages, being plain and manifest to all, do sufficiently demonstrate the benignity of <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; among which I reckon the death of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to be no small cause of the Romans' happiness and security. For he, being a man of wonderful success and most famous exploits, of invincible confidence and pride, who shot like a star, with incredible swiftness, from the rising to the setting sun, was meditating to bring the lustre of his arms into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. The pretence of this intended expedition was the death of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> <a href=/people/3724 target=_blank>Molossus</a>, who was killed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393207PPan class=place long=20.5745 lat=39.2525>Pandosia</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>; but the true cause was the desire of glory and the emulation of empire, which instigated him to war against all mankind, that he might extend his dominion beyond the bounds of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. He had heard of the Roman power in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, terrible as an army in battle array; of the illustrious name and glory which they had acquired by innumerable battles, in which they were flushed with victory; and this was a sufficient provocation to his ambitious spirit to commence a war against them, which could not have been decided without an ocean of blood; for both armies appeared invincible, both of fearless and undaunted minds; and the Romans then had no fewer than one hundred and thirty thousand stout and valiant men, All expert soldiers, skilled on foot to dare, Or from the bounding courser urge the war. </p>                        </div>
