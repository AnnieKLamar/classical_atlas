For certainly he was strikingly big of body, and notable among all the soldiers for courage, handsome in a manly way, fierce in his manners, rough, haughty, and scornful, yet often a just man. <br />3 It was in the following way that he first came into prominence in the reign of <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>. 4 <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, on the birthday of <a href=/people/11068 target=_blank>Geta</a>, his younger son, was giving military games, offering various silver prizes, arm-rings, that is, and collars, and girdles. 5 This youth, half barbarian and scarcely yet master of the Latin tongue, speaking almost pure Thracian, publicly besought the Emperor to give him leave to compete, and that with men of no mean rank in the service. 6 <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a>, struck with his bodily size, pitted him first against sutlers — all very valorous men, none the less — in order to avoid a rupture of military discipline. 7 Whereupon <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> overcame sixteen sutlers at one sweat, and received his sixteen prizes, all rather small and not military ones, and was commanded to serve in the army. </p>                        </div>

Would you like to wrestle now after your running? And <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> answered, As you please, Emperor. 4 On this <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> dismounted and ordered the most vigorous and the bravest soldiers to match themselves with him; 5 whereupon he, in his usual fashion, vanquished seven at one sweat, and alone of all, after he had gotten his silver prizes, was presented by <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> with a collar of gold; he was ordered, moreover, to take a permanent post in the palace with the body-guard. 6 In this fashion, then, he was made prominent and became famous among the soldiers, well liked by the tribunes, and admired by his comrades. He could obtain from the Emperor whatever he wanted, and indeed <a href=/people/501 target=_blank>Severus</a> helped him to advancement in the service when he was still very young.

But under <a href=/people/3419 target=_blank>Macrinus</a>, whom he hated bitterly because he had slain his Emperor's son, he left the service and acquired an estate in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, in the village where he was born, and here he trafficked continually with the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>.

But he could have no influence with that filthy man. 7 For <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> is said to have made sport of him most foully, saying, You are reported, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, to have outworn at times sixteen and twenty and thirty soldiers; can you avail thirty times with a woman? 8 And when <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> saw the disgraceful prince beginning thus, he left the service. 9 In the end, however, the friends of <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a> retained him, lest this also be added to <a href=/people/11040 target=_blank>Elagabalus</a>'s ill-fame, that the bravest man of his time — whom some called <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, others <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, and others <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> — had been driven from his army. </p>                        </div>

And about the latter we shall tell later on the few things that we know. 2 Now <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was always clever enough not to rule the soldiers by force alone; on the contrary, he made them devoted to him by rewards and riches. 3 He never took away any man's rations; 4 he never let any man in his army work as a smith or artisan, which most of them are, but kept the legions busy only with frequent hunting. 5 Along with these virtues, however, went such cruelty that some called him <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclops</a>, some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309312UBou class=place long=31.243 lat=30.912>Busiris</a>, and others <a href=/people/1303 target=_blank>Sciron</a>, not a few <a href=/people/654 target=_blank>Phalaris</a>, and many <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> or <a href=/people/870 target=_blank>Gyges</a>. 6 The senate was so afraid of him that prayers were made in the temples both publicly and privately, and even by women together with their children, that he should never see the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. 7 For they kept hearing that he hung men on the cross, shut them in the bodies of animals newly slain, cast them to wild beasts, dashed out their brains with clubs, and all this for no desire for personal authority but because he seemed to wish military discipline to be supreme, and wished to amend civil affairs on that pattern. 8 All of which does not become a prince who wishes to be loved. As a matter of fact, he was convinced that the throne could not be held except by cruelty. 9 He likewise feared that the nobility, because of his low barbarian birth, would scorn him, 10 remembering in this connection how he had been scorned at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the very slaves of the nobles, so that not even their stewards would admit him to their presence; 11 and as is always the way with fatuous beliefs, he expected them to be the same toward him now that he was emperor.

And this caused unbounded rejoicing in the city; indeed at altars, temples, shrines, and holy places everywhere, everyone offered up thanks. 7 As for <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>, a somewhat timid soul by nature, who trembled when he heard <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' very name, he sacrificed a hecatomb and gave orders that the gods should be worshipped with an equal sacrifice in every town. 8 Soon thereafter <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and after going into the senate, where thanks were offered him, he held an assembly, whence he and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> and <a href=/people/11045 target=_blank>Gordian</a> victoriously betook themselves to the Palace. </p>                        </div>

This the elder <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> never permitted; for he said God forbid that any free man should ever print a kiss on my feet. 8 And while we are speaking of the elder <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> we should not forbear to mention this amusing thing: as we have said, <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> was almost eight and a half feet tall; and certain men deposited a shoe of his, that is, one of his royal boots, in a grove which lies between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> and Arcia, because, sooth, they agreed that it was a foot longer than the measure of any foot of man. 9 Whence also is derived the vulgar expression, used for lanky and awkward fellows, of <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>' boot. 10 I have put this down lest any one who reads <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a> should believe that I have overlooked anything which pertained to my subject.

He had a shield, moreover, inlaid with gold and jewels, and also a gold-inlaid spear. 9 He had silver swords made for him, too, and gold ones as well, everything, in fact, which could enhance his beauty — helmets inset with precious stones and cheek-pieces done in the same fashion. <br />10 These are the facts which can be known and related of the boy with propriety. But whoever desires to know the rest, about sexual and amorous affairs with which <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a> bespatters him, let him read <a href=/people/6382 target=_blank>Cordus</a>; as for us, we make an end of our book here, and hasten on, as though bidden by a public duty, to other things. </p>                        </div>

And from this the soothsayers declared that from the one house there would spring two emperors of the same name, whose reign would be of no long duration. His father's cuirass — many saw it — was stained not with rust, as is usual, but all over with a purple colour. 4 These omens, moreover, occurred for the son: When he was sent to a grammarian, a certain kinswoman of his gave him the works of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> all written in letters of gold on purple. 5 And while he was yet a little boy, he was asked to dinner by <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as a compliment to his father, and, being without a dinner-robe, he wore one of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s. 6 When still an infant, moreover, he mounted up into a carriage of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a>'s that unexpectedly came down the public way, seeing it empty, and sat down; and only with great ado was he routed out by the coachmen. 7 Nor were there lacking then those who told <a href=/people/4913 target=_blank>Caracalla</a> to beware of the child.

For although <a href=/people/1445 target=_blank>Dexippus</a>, <a href=/people/3342 target=_blank>Arrianus</a>, and many other Greek writers have said that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a> were set up as emperors against <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a>, and that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, being sent out with the army, prepared for war at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a>, and did not see <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> until after he was victorious, Latin writers have said that it was not <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> but <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a> who fought <a href=/people/1138 target=_blank>Maximinus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458134UAqu class=place long=13.368 lat=45.7692>Aquileia</a> and beat him. 3 Whence this error arose I cannot say, unless it be that <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> and <a href=/people/11053 target=_blank>Pupienus</a> were one and the same. 4 At any rate, I have set this statement down with its authorities, in order that no one may believe that I did not know it — which indeed would cause great wonder and amazement! </p>                        </div>
