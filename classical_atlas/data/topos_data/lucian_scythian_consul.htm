Some account of the significance of this name, the origin of his worship, and his connexion with the sons of <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, will not, I think, be out of place: for it will be seen from this that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, in conferring immortality on mortals, and sending them to keep company with <a href=/people/2074 target=_blank>Zamolxis</a>, do not stand alone; since the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> permit themselves to make Gods of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> upon Greek soil. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> attended to his instructions, and after several sprinklings had been performed, the plague troubled them no more; whether it was that the perfume of the wine neutralized certain noxious vapours, or that the hero, being a medical hero, had some other motive for his advice. However that may be, he continues to this day to draw a fee for his professional services, in the shape of a white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, which is sacrificed on his tomb. This tomb was pointed out by Dimaenete as the place from which he issued with his instructions about the wine; and beneath it <a href=/people/1914 target=_blank>Toxaris</a> was found buried, his identity being established not merely by the inscription, of which only a part remained legible, but also by the figure engraved on the monument, which was that of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=demonym long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythian</a>, with a bow, ready strung, in his left hand, and in the right what appeared to be a book. You may still make out more than half the figure, with the bow and book complete: but the upper portion of the stone, including the face, has suffered from the ravages of time. It is situated not far from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237FDip class=place long=23.719 lat=37.9786>Dipylus</a>, on your left as you leave the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237FDip class=place long=23.719 lat=37.9786>Dipylus</a> for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>. The mound is of no great size, and the pillar lies prostrate: yet it never lacks a garland, and there are statements to the effect that fever-patients have been known to be cured by the hero; which indeed is not surprising, considering that he once healed an entire city. </p>                        </div>

In this frame of mind he had already reached the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237XKer class=place long=23.7188 lat=37.9781>Ceramicus</a>, when his good genius appeared to him in the guise of <a href=/people/1914 target=_blank>Toxaris</a>. The attention of the latter was immediately arrested by the dress of his native country, nor was it likely that he would have any difficulty in recognizing <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a>, who was of noble birth and of the highest rank in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>. <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a>, on the other hand, could not be expected to see a compatriot in <a href=/people/1914 target=_blank>Toxaris</a>, who was dressed in the Greek fashion, without sword or belt, wore no beard, and from his fluent speech might have been an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> born; so completely had time transformed him.

'What, is my name still remembered among you? — Yes, I am <a href=/people/1914 target=_blank>Toxaris</a>.' 'Then,' said <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a>, 'you see before you a disciple, who has caught your enthusiasm for Greece; it was with no other object than this that I set out on my travels. The hardships I have endured in the countries through which I passed on my way hither are infinite; and I had already decided, when I met you, that before the sun set I would return to my ship; so much was I disturbed at the strange and outlandish sights that I have seen.

Unlike <a href=/people/606 target=_blank>Anacharsis</a>, who had but one informant, and a barbarian at that, I had many; and all told me the same tale, in almost the same words.
