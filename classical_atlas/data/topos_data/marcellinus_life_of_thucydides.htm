Thucydides does mention, however, that many poets call the nightingale the bird of Daulia, i.e., of the land where the “Thracian” Tereus had dwelt. He thereby draws some attention to the poets’ account of Tereus’ cutting out of Philomela’s tongue (lest men or gods hear Philomela’s tale of his rape of her) and of Philomela’s transformation by the gods, in the end, into a nightingale. <br />37. Thucydides 6.2.1.</i>]] <br /> [[<i>38. See Thucydides 2.102.5-6. With Powell, I here follow the manuscript rather than the emendations suggested by editors, which would eliminate the clause “where that which has to do with his moderation makes the islands” and substitute “where he makes him mindful.” Thucydides makes no mention of moderation (sophrosune) in his account. He does, however, mention an oracle’s intimation that the matricide Alcmeon would have no “release from terrors” until he found a land that had not been seen by the sun when he killed his mother. And as he indicates, Alcmeon managed to achieve this very release by the recognition of what we might call the flux of nature in the formation of land where there had been sea. This release from terrors appears to be what Marcellinus has in mind by Alcmeon’s achieving “moderation.”</i>]]</p>                        </div>
