Dictators held temporary sway; while the power of the Decemviri lasted less than two years (451BC), nor did the consular authority of the military tribunes endure (408-367BC). <br />Neither <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> (consul 87-84BC) nor <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> (dictator 82-79BC) dominated long, and <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> (at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369390UCar class=place long=39.031 lat=36.864>Carrhae</a> 53BC) and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> (at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393224UPha class=place long=22.3869 lat=39.2883>Pharsalia</a> 48BC) swiftly yielded power to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> (36BC) and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> their swords to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavian</a>, who under the name of prince, received a world weary of civil war beneath his imperial rule . <br />But while the successes and disasters of ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> have been related by famous writers; and there was no lack of noble intellects to speak of the <a href=/people/3350 target=_blank>Augustan</a> age, until the tide of adulation deterred them; reports of the actions attributed to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> and <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> were distorted by fear while they lived, and by enduring hatred once they were dead. <br />Therefore, I plan to describe only a small part of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>’ reign, the last, then the principate of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> and the rest, without anger or partisanship, distanced as I am from such motives. </p>                        </div>

Relinquishing his title of triumvir, he professed himself a plain consul, content to wield only a tribune’s authority in safeguarding the commons. <br />Seducing the military with gifts, the people with cheap grain, the world with the delights of peace, he gradually gained power, taking to himself the duties of the senate, the magistracy and the law, unopposed. The boldest had fallen in the field or been proscribed, the remaining nobility, raised to wealth and high office by their propensity for servitude, profiting from the turn of events, preferred security and their present situation to the dangers of the old order. <br />Nor did the provinces oppose this state of affairs, the power of the senate and people having been discredited by the quarrels among the great and the magistrates’ avarice, there being no help from a legal system skewed by force, favouritism and in the end bribery. </p>                        </div>

Adopted as son, imperial colleague, and consort with tribunician power, he was displayed to the armies, not covertly as before due to his mother <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>’s diplomacy, but openly and with her encouragement. <br />For so tight a grip had she on the ageing <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, that he banished his one surviving grandson, <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426100IPla class=place long=10.0975 lat=42.5869>Planasia</a>.

By far the majority, however, spread derogatory thoughts about the likely successors: <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, truculent and enraged by his humiliations, was through age and inexperience unequal to such a burden; <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was mature in years and proven in warfare, but showed the old innate arrogance of the Claudians; and strong indications of a cruel nature emerged however much he repressed them. <br />He had been reared from infancy in the ruling house; consulates and triumphs had been showered on him in his youth: and even during his years as an exile in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, in apparent retirement, his thoughts centred only on his indignation, on dissimulation, and his hidden desires. <br />Add to this his mother with her woman’s lack of self-control, and they would be slaves to the female, and a pair of youngsters also, who would, in the process, oppress the state and someday tear it apart. </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> effected everything via the consuls as in the old Republic, and as if the source of authority were ambiguous. Even his edict summoning the Fathers to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate house</a> was only issued with the force of his tribunician title, received from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>. <br />This edict was in few words and very moderate in tone: he intended to pay the last respects to his father, whose body he could not leave, the only function of the state he would himself exercise. Yet, at <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>’ death, he had assigned the passwords to the praetorian cohorts as emperor; he appointed the sentries, bodyguard, and the rest of the court; guards escorted him to the forum, and the curia. He sent despatches to the army as if the principate were his, showing no sign of hesitation, except when speaking in the senate. <br />His chief motive was fear, lest <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, with his many legions, the support of the provinces, and his wondrous popularity with the people, might prefer to take power rather than anticipate it. He conceded to public opinion too, in wanting to seem one summoned to power and elected by the state, rather than worming his way there through a woman’s intrigues and a senile act of adoption. <br />It was realised later that this feigned hesitancy was in order to gain insight into the inclinations of the nobility: since he was storing away words and glances of theirs, interpreted by him as crimes. </p>                        </div>

The soldiers, not understanding the reason, took it as a present omen, the moon’s eclipse a sign of their own struggles, which would yield a happy result if only the goddess’s brilliance and clarity could be restored. <br />Thus the clanging of bronze, and a chorus of bugles and horns, rang out; and they rejoiced then mourned as, amidst now rising cloud, she seemed to brighten then fade, until sight of her was lost, and they thought her entombed in darkness.

These men joined the watch, the patrols, the sentries at the gates, offering hope and spreading fear: ‘How long must we besiege our emperor’s son? What will be the end of this mutiny? Are we to swear loyalty to Percennius and Vibulenus? Will Percennius and Vibulenus grant us our pay, and the land we earn? Are they to seize power over the Roman people, from the line of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> and <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>? Rather as the last to offend, should we not be the first indeed to repent? Things demanded by the many are slowest to be granted: personal favours are swiftly earned and swiftly guaranteed.’ <br />Minds were changed by this and, suspicious of each other, the raw recruits dissociated themselves from the veterans, legion from legion.

They heaped insults upon them, and were ready to murder them, especially <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, whose dignity precluded flight; nor could he seek any refuge in extremity other than the quarters of the First legion.

And what if those treated as of secondary importance were incensed by the slight? <br />Yet in the form of his sons they could be treated equally while preserving his own authority, which was even more imposing from a distance.

Surely, if our ancestors conceded that members might, when in a position to speak, wander somewhat from the subject to offer something to the public good, it was not so that we might add to our private interests or family fortunes, while rendering unpopular both the senate and its leader whether it grant or deny the request. <br />It is no petition, but a peremptory demand, one both untimely and unexpected, when a senator rises, in a session convened for other purposes, and urges the number and age of his children on the senate’s goodwill, applies the same pressure by association to myself, and, so to speak, takes the treasury by storm, which if we exhaust it by favouritism it would be a crime to refill. The divine <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> gave you the money, <a href=/people/5045 target=_blank>Hortalus</a>, but not because he was compelled to do so, nor by that decision was it granted in perpetuity.

This he did hesitantly under <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, whose reprisals, as architect of both kingdoms, if scorned, he greatly feared. But on certain news of the change of emperors, he sent warriors to plunder and demolished forts, a motive for war. </p>                        </div>

This is the sole concession, above and beyond the usual legal framework, that we grant <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, that the enquiry into his death be held in the Curia and not the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFRo class=place long=12.485108 lat=41.892507>Forum</a>, and before the Senate and not the bench; let the rest of the proceedings show the like restraint.

Not only were they weak and unequal to hard work, but if allowed they turned harsh, ambitious, greedy for power. They strutted about among the men, held the centurions in the palm of their hands; recently a woman had even presided at military exercises, and the parade of the legions. <br /> They might like to consider how often when a governor was accused of extortion, the bulk of the accusations were against the wife. The most dubious of provincials immediately attached themselves to her, she it was who handled business affairs and completed transactions. There were two to be cultivated, two courts, and the more violent and headstrong orders came from the women, whom once the <a href=/people/3221 target=_blank>Oppian</a> and other laws constrained, but who, now liberated, ruled house, law-court and army. </p>                        </div>

The latter must certainly be prepared to fight, but returning after his labours what was more fitting than a wife’s solace? What if a few sank into greed and intrigue? Were the magistrates themselves not liable to many and various lapses? Yet were they not still sent out to govern provinces? <br />Husbands were often corrupted by their wives’ depravities, was every bachelor then incorruptible? The <a href=/people/3221 target=_blank>Oppian</a> laws were formerly agreed upon because in those days the republic required them, but afterwards it was beneficial to ease and relax them somewhat. It was wrong to call our own inertia by another title, for if the wife went beyond proper limits, it was the husband’s fault. Moreover, it was unfair that a husband should be separated from the partner who shared in his success and failure, through the faults attributable to only one or two, while the naturally weaker sex was left exposed to its own excesses, and the desires of others. Marriage could hardly be kept intact by confining people: what would happen if it were to be suspended for years in the manner of a divorce? And whilst they were moving to check abuses elsewhere, they might wish to remember the scandalous goings-on in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>! <br /><a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> then added a few comments regarding his own married life; for princes too often had to visit remote parts of the empire.

It is interesting to seek out the causes of that change. <br />Once, rich families or those of illustrious distinction were ruined by a passion for magnificence. For its was still acceptable to court or be courted by the people, our allies and dependent royalty, such that the greater the wealth, residence and appurtenances the more illustrious a man’s reputation and clients. <br />After an age of savage executions, when great fame meant death, the survivors chose a wiser path. At the same time, newcomers from the municipalities, colonies, and even the provinces were frequently appointed to the Senate, and brought with them their own fashion of plain-living, and though many reached an affluent old age through effort or good luck their previous attitude persisted. Yet the chief proponent of a stricter morality was <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a>, himself of the old style regarding dress and table. <br />Hence, respect for the emperor, and the love of emulation, proved stronger than laws and punishment. Or perhaps there is something akin to a natural cycle in all things, such that as the seasons rotate, so does our manner of living.

Thus their predecessors had decreed that punishment should only follow where a crime had already taken place, nor should they overturn what had been invented wisely and always observed thereafter.

In bestowing honours, he bore in mind the nobility of a man’s ancestors, military distinction, and outstanding civic ability, so that it was quite clear no better choice could be made. The consulate, the praetorship still made a show, and the powers even of the minor magistrates were exercised; while the laws, apart from cases of treason, were properly applied. <br />Next, the corn-distribution and the tax revenues along with other public income were handled by companies of Roman knights. His own affairs <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> entrusted to proven individuals, sometimes outside the nobility, based on their reputation; and once appointed, men held office, almost indefinitely, many growing old in such service. <br />The people were, indeed, troubled with the high cost of food, but none of the blame for that lay with the emperor: he spared neither effort nor expense in countering the effects of poor harvests and turbulent seas. And he ensured that the provinces were not troubled by fresh burdens, and that those which existed were imposed without greed or excessive severity by the magistrates: physical violence and the forfeiture of assets were done away with. <br />His holdings of land in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> were few, his number of slaves limited, his household run by a small number of freedmen; and any arbitration required between himself and private citizens was decided in court and according to the law. </p>                        </div>

The consuls having seated themselves on the ordinary benches as a sign of mourning, he suggested they resume their place in the seats of honour, and as the senators continued to shed tears he suppressed their lamentation, and encouraged them with a formal speech. <br />Even he was not unaware, he said, that he might be criticised for appearing before the Senate with a grief so fresh: mourners were often unable to bear their own relatives’ condolences, could scarcely bear the sight of day, nor were they to be condemned as lacking in fortitude: yet he himself sought greater solace in embracing affairs of state. <br />Saddened as he was, by <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>’s extreme old age, his own declining years and his grandsons’ immaturity as yet, he nevertheless asked that <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>’ elder sons (<a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> and <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>) be introduced.

Nor did he lack discretion, since he still retained influence and favour with <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> to an equal degree. <br />From this, I am driven to wonder whether the inclinations and antipathies of princes towards each of us are determined by destiny and our situation at birth, or whether something is left to our own will, and that between pure defiance and vile servility we might find a path free of danger or obsequiousness. <br />But <a href=/people/5788 target=_blank>Messalinus</a> <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, with no less distinguished a lineage, yet a very different character, proposed a senate decree proclaiming that a magistrate even though innocent himself and knowing nothing of his wife’s guilt should be punished for her wrongdoings in the provinces as if they were his own. </p>                        </div>

Nor did he err through thoughtlessness; nor is it anything but obvious when an emperor’s actions are praised with sincerity as opposed to a feigned enthusiasm. And indeed, he to whom oratory was alien and speech seemingly a struggle was all the more prompt and eloquent when he was merciful. <br />However, when Publius <a href=/people/8348 target=_blank>Suillius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, formerly <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>’ quaestor, was sentenced to banishment from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> charged with corrupt legal practices, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> moved, and with such vigour that he even swore on oath that the interests of the State required it, that <a href=/people/8348 target=_blank>Suillius</a> be deported to an island,. Criticised severely at the time, his decision accrued praise on <a href=/people/8348 target=_blank>Suillius</a>’ later return, when the man was seen by the following generation, all-powerful and venal under <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, exploiting that emperor’s friendship, and never for the better. <br />The same mode of exile was to be inflicted on Firmius <a href=/people/2217 target=_blank>Catus</a>, a member of the Senate, for falsely accusing his sister of the crime of treason.

And since he had heard that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, when disposing of his daughter <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, had considered even Roman knights to be of some account, then if a husband was sought for <a href=/people/12039 target=_blank>Livilla</a>, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> might bear in mind a friend whose only benefit from such a union would be the glory. <br />He did not seek to lay aside the duties imposed on him: it was enough, in his estimation, if his household was more strongly equipped to counter <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>’s unjustified displeasure, and that for his children’s sake; for, as to himself, whatever the term of years he might fulfil under such a prince, that would be life enough for him and more. </p>                        </div>

He would respond more straightforwardly, firstly with regard to <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>’s hostility, which would blaze far more fiercely if <a href=/people/12039 target=_blank>Livilla</a>’s marriage were to divide the House of Caesar into two warring parties. Even as things were, there were eruptions of female jealousy, and the discord upset his grandchildren: what then if such a marriage were to increase the feuding? ‘Indeed, <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>,’ he continued, ‘you are deluded if you think you can hold your present rank and that <a href=/people/12039 target=_blank>Livilla</a>, who was wed to <a href=/people/11011 target=_blank>Gaius Caesar</a> and then <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, will accept growing old beside a Roman knight. <br />Even if I agreed, do you believe it will be acceptable to those who witnessed her brother, her father, and our ancestors holding the highest office? You may wish, yourself, to remain in your current position: but those magistrates and notables who force themselves on you, without your wish, to consult you on all and sundry, do not hide their view that you long ago surpassed the heights of the equestrian order and the manner of friendship accepted by my father, and through envy of you they censure myself also. <br />Indeed, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> did consider bestowing his daughter on a Roman knight. Astounding, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, that distracted by every care, and given the immense distinction that would accrue to whomever he raise above his peers by so great an alliance, he yet still spoke of Gaius <a href=/people/2926 target=_blank>Proculeius</a> and a few other such men, noted for the tranquility of their existence, and not at all involved in State affairs. But if we are to be influenced by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>’ consideration of that option, how much more relevant it seems that he that he later chose Marcus <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> for her, and then myself! <br />I have avoided replying obscurely, for friendship’s sake: moreover I shall not thwart your or <a href=/people/12039 target=_blank>Livilla</a>’s intentions. I will resist speaking, for the present, of matters I have in mind, in which you and I might act together: so much however I will say, that no rank is too exalted for you to be unworthy of it, given your virtues and your devotion to myself, and at the appropriate time, either in the Senate or by public address, I shall not remain silent.’ </p>                        </div>

This was adhered to initially: but then enriched by their haul, and indulging in pleasure, they abandoned their posts for wild banquets or to sprawl in drunken sleep. <br />The enemy, therefore, who were aware of their neglect of duty organised two columns, one to attack the plunderers, the other as a diversion to threaten the Roman camp, not in hope of capturing it, but so that, amidst the clamour and the missiles, every man, intent on his own predicament, might be deaf to the sound of the primary assault. Moreover darkness was chosen for the onslaught, to increase the panic. <br />But the attempt on the legion’s defences was easily repelled; though our Thracian auxiliaries were terrified by the sudden incursion, some being positioned adjacent to our ramparts, the majority scattered beyond, and were slaughtered the more ruthlessly, being branded as deserters and traitors armed to enslave themselves and their country. </p>                        </div>

The island overlooked the most beautiful of bays until the eruption of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408144LVes class=place long=14.425 lat=40.8216>Vesuvius</a> (AD79) changed the face of the landscape. <br />Tradition has it that the area was colonised by Greece, and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406143ICap class=place long=14.2623 lat=40.5579>Capri</a> was inhabited by the <a href=/people/6003 target=_blank>Teleboans</a>. But <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> now occupied it with his twelve imposing and individually named villas.

Indeed you will find that the wisest of the ancients, and the followers of their schools, are in disagreement. Many of them are of the opinion that the gods are concerned neither with our origin nor our end, nor with humankind at all; such that the virtuous experience many sorrows, while wrongdoers experience as many pleasures. <br />Others, on the contrary, think that there is indeed a harmony in events, but emanating not from the wanderings of the planets, but in truth from the origins and the web of natural causation; yet they leave us free to choose in life, though once a choice is made the immediate future is determined. Nor are good and evil what the crowd thinks: for many are happy, who seem to live at the mercy of adverse circumstances, while many others are miserable despite their vast wealth, wherever, that is, the former steadfastly endure fortune’s blows, or the latter employ their prosperity unwisely. <br /> But the majority believe mortals are not free, that their future is determined from the outset, though the train of events may prove a prophecy false, due to those who are filled with deceit speaking of things about which they are ignorant: thus an art is discredited, for which clear evidence has been claimed, in ancient times and our own.

Yet though the ancient sources are confusing with regard to the matter, there were less than two hundred and fifty years between <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, hence the view that this later phoenix was spurious and not from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, and pursuing none of the habits affirmed by tradition. <br />For, so it is said, when the number of its years is complete, and death is approaching, it builds a nest in its own country, pouring out its life-force there, from which its successor rises, whose first task on reaching maturity is to inter its predecessor, not after any random fashion, but once equal to the task having lifted a mass of myrrh and proved itself by a long flight, it grasps its father’s body, transports it to the altar of the Sun, and consigns it to the flames. <br />These details are unverified and augmented by fable, but there is no disagreement as to the bird’s being seen at various times in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. </p>                        </div>

Fear of the executioner, it was, that rendered this mode of suicide acceptable, and the fact that a condemned man’s estate was forfeit, and burial denied, while those who passed sentence on themselves were rewarded for their readiness to do so, their body being interred and their last wishes respected. <br /><a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, however, explained in a letter to the Senate that though it had been our ancestors’ custom when they severed a friendship to forbid the offender their house and thereby end amicable relations, and though he had reverted to that practice in this matter also, <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a>, who had been pursued for maladministration of his province and other crimes, while wrapping his guilt in ill-will towards <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> himself had terrified his wife, groundlessly, who even if guilty was still in no danger. <br />Next <a href=/people/1888 target=_blank>Mamercus</a> <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> was again impeached, who though noted for his ancestry and his talent as an advocate, led a shameful life. He was ruined not by his friendship with <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>, but by an agent of destruction no less powerful, his hatred of Macro.

His own loyalty was intact and, if it were not insidiously attacked, would remain so. He would not accept replacement by a successor as anything other than an indication that he was marked out for death. A kind of treaty might be struck, however, by which the emperor might have authority over all else, while he retained his province. <br />This account, though remarkable, drew credibility from the fact that along among <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>’ associates <a href=/people/4155 target=_blank>Gaetulicus</a> remained unharmed, and in high favour, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> being aware that he himself was the object of public disapproval, that his life was nearing its end, and his own position depended more on public opinion than real strength. </p>                        </div>

By now Macro’s power was excessive, who never neglectful of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>’s favour now courted it daily, and after the death of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>’s wife, <a href=/people/4574 target=_blank>Junia</a> Claudilla, he had forced his own wife Ennia to mislead the youth with a pretence of love, and bind him with a promise of marriage. <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> made no objection, while he could glimpse power; since excitable though his character was he had still acquired, almost without knowing, the hypocrisy learnt at his grandfather’s side. <br />This <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> knew, and he hesitated, initially, therefore as to the succession, in considering each of his grandchildren. Of these, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/4535 target=_blank>Gemellus</a>, son of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> the Younger, was the closest to him by blood and affection, but had not yet reached manhood. <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>, <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>’ son, possessed the vigour of manhood, yet also the support of the masses, to his grandfather a cause of dislike. Even <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, <a href=/people/2619 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>’ brother, of mature years and with a love for the arts, was considered, the obstacle being his impaired mental faculties. <br />If a successor was sought outside the imperial house, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> feared lest the memory of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, the name of the Caesars, were turned to derision and contempt: for his care was not so much for present popularity but to find favour with posterity. Soon, irresolute of mind, weary of body, he left to fate a decision to which he felt himself unequal, though comments escaped him from which might be gained his insight into the future. <br />He reproached Macro with forsaking the setting, and looking to the rising sun, and to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> himself, who in a chance conversation derided the memory of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, he remarked, prophetically, that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> would possess all <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>’s vices with none of his virtues. At the same time, his eyes filled with tears, he embraced <a href=/people/4535 target=_blank>Gemellus</a>, the youngest of his grandsons then, seeing <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a>’s dark look, said: ‘You shall kill him, and another slay you.’ <br />Nevertheless, despite his failing health, he denied himself none of his vices, enduring them as if in a simulation of vigour, while he mocked the physicians’ arts, and those who after the age of thirty needed a stranger’s advice to distinguish what harmed the body from what benefited it. </p>                        </div>

While departing from a banquet as though on private business, he clasped <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>’ hand, as if paying his respects, and felt the emperor’s pulse. The hint failed; for <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, unsure whether to show offence, accordingly concealed his anger, ordered the dinner to proceed, and reclined at table beyond his usual hour, as if paying a compliment to his now absent friend. <br />Yet <a href=/people/607 target=_blank>Charicles</a> confirmed to Macro that the emperor’s life was ebbing, and that he would not last beyond a few days.

On the sixteenth of March, owing to a breathing problem, it was thought he had ended his mortal life, and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> was leaving to begin his imperial rule, amidst a host of congratulations, when word suddenly arrived that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had regained his speech and sight and was summoning servants to bring him refreshment after his lapse. <br />A general panic ensued, and while <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caligula</a> stood silently fixed to the spot, now after having attained the height of expectation dreading the worst, and the crowd scattered in all directions, Macro, undismayed, while they all fled the threshold, ordered the old man smothered under a pile of bedclothes.

For even after being taken apart by the torturer, though not denying his own guilt he divulged nothing regarding any accomplices, and whether any existed whose names he concealed is uncertain. <br />In the same consulate, Publius <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> proposed an annual gladiatorial show, to be paid for by those who gained a quaestorship. Among our ancestors, office was the reward for merit, and all citizens trusted for their integrity could aspire to the magistracy; nor was there any age-qualification preventing anyone attaining a consulship or a dictatorship (holding authority as supreme magistrate) in early youth. <br />The quaestorship was instituted while kings still reigned in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, as shown by Lucius <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>’ renewal of the lex curiata (the conferring of authority over the State). The power of selection for the post lay with the consuls, until, as with the rest of the offices, it passed into the hands of the people. The first elections to the post (447BC), sixty-three years after the expulsion of the <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquins</a> were of <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/6849 target=_blank>Potitus</a> and <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a> <a href=/people/1888 target=_blank>Mamercus</a>, appointed to supervise military finances.

Even when that role was reassumed by the knights, the quaestorship was still granted according to the worth of the candidate, or the readiness to appoint of the electors, until with <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>’s proposal it was effectively put up for auction. </p>                        </div>

It was well enough known that his army contained veterans who had never mounted guard, or stood on watch, who viewed ditches and ramparts as something strange and wonderful, had neither helmets nor breastplates but, sleek and prosperous, had served their time in town. So, after dismissing the aged and sick, he sought reinforcements. <br />Levies were raised throughout <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=place long=33 lat=40.1>Galatia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and a legion from <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> was added, with its complement of auxiliary <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and foot. The whole army was kept under canvas, though the winter weather was so fierce that the ice-covered ground had to be dug over to provide pitches for the tents. Many of the men had frostbite from the force of the cold, and a few died while on sentry-duty. One soldier was seen carrying a bundle of firewood, his hands so frozen to his load that they were torn from his arms when it fell. <br /><a href=/people/1589 target=_blank>Corbulo</a> himself, lightly clothed and bare-headed, frequently amongst them on the march, or at their labours, praising the strong, comforting the weak, was an example to them all. Then objection to orders, and desertion, became so frequent due to the harsh climate and the military task, that the remedy was sought in greater severity. <br />Indeed, contrary to the rule elsewhere, no pardon was granted for first and second offences, but whoever relinquished the standard immediately paid with his life. It was clear that this procedure had a salutary effect, and was more effective than showing sympathy: since the camp experienced fewer desertions than in those where exemptions were granted. </p>                        </div>

The slingers, both ‘libritores’ and ‘funditores’, were assigned a position from which to hurl their shot at long range lest, threatened on all sides, one point under pressure was relieved by reinforcements from another. <br />In the event, the men showed so much ardour in action, that before a third of the day had passed, the walls were cleared of defenders, the barricaded gateways shattered, the fortifications taken by escalade, and all the adult males within slaughtered, without the loss of one soldier, and with very few wounds incurred.

Why, she asked, was their marriage deferred? Presumably her beauty displeased him, or her grandfather’s triumph, or was it her fecundity and true spirit? Or was there the fear that, once she was his wife, she might disclose the wrongs done to senators, the anger of the populace against his mother’s pride and avarice? <br />Or if <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a> would brook no daughter-in-law not hostile to her son, she argued, let she herself be restored to <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>: or go to whatever corner of the earth existed, where she might rather hear, not witness, this insult to the emperor, and no longer be entangled in his troubles.

Then the oarsmen decided to lean to one side and so sink the vessel, but agreement did not come promptly enough for sudden measures, and a counter-effort by others provided an opportunity for the victims’ gentler entry into the waves. <br />Acerronia, in fact, unwisely calling out that she was <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a> and demanding aid for the emperor’s mother, was despatched with poles, oars and every piece of nautical equipment to hand: but <a href=/people/720 target=_blank>Agrippina</a>, silent, and so less easily detected (though she received a wound in the shoulder), swam for it, then reaching some sailing-vessels was carried to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WLuc class=place long=14.08 lat=40.8292>Lucrine lake</a>, and brought to her villa. </p>                        </div>

There was not the slightest outbreak of partisanship among the audience, since the actors though restored to the stage were barred from the sacred competitions. No one carried off the prize for eloquence, as the emperor was declared the winner. The Greek dress, which many adopted throughout the festival, was immediately rendered obsolete. </p>                        </div>

Thus, as if <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was already dethroned, they began to question who might next be chosen. Rubellius <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a> was the name on every tongue, who, on his mother’s side, drew nobility from the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> House. He cherished the beliefs of his ancestors, austere of character, his household chaste and secluded, and the more retiring he became due to his fears, the finer his reputation. <br />The rumours were increased by the interpretation, equally worthless, placed on a lightning strike. For while <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> was dining beside the Simbruine dams (at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419131USub class=place long=13.0947 lat=41.926>Subiaco</a>), in his villa known as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419131USub class=place long=13.0947 lat=41.926>Sublaqueum</a> (Below the Waters), the banquet was struck and the table shattered. Because the accident occurred in the area of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tivoli</a>), from which <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a>’ father originated, it was believed that he had been marked out by divine intent. He was favoured by many of those whose desire, and generally unrewarding ambition, it is to nurture the new and dubious. <br /><a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, therefore, troubled by this, composed a letter to <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a> advising him to consider the peace of the capital, and remove himself from the scandal-mongers: saying that he had family estates in <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a> Minor, where he could enjoy his youth in safety, and undisturbed. Accordingly, <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a> retired there, with his wife <a href=/people/5436 target=_blank>Antistia</a>, and a few intimate friends. <br />At about the same time, <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>’s desire for excess, brought him into disrepute and some danger. He had entered the source of the water that Quintus <a href=/people/10971 target=_blank>Marcius</a> had brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> (via the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125AqMa class=place long=12.5103 lat=41.8975>Aqua Marcia</a>) in order to swim, and it was considered that by bathing there he had polluted the holy spring, and profaned the sanctity of the site.

Neither hand nor steel were needed: he had merely to confess to adultery with <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a>.

Hence, when <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, by his frequent assurances, convinced the conspirators that he himself, a commander of the Praetorian Guard, had condescended to join their faction, they were now more prompt to set a time and place for the assassination. <br />It was said that Subrius <a href=/people/3027 target=_blank>Flavus</a> had felt the impulse to attack <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> when he was singing on stage, or when the palace was on fire and he was rushing here and there, unguarded, in the night. In the latter case there was the opportunity presented by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>’s temporary isolation; in the former, the very presence of an audience, as the finest witness possible to such a deed, had stirred his imagination.

For <a href=/people/5632 target=_blank>Epicharis</a> was summoned, confronted with the informant, and with no other witness available, silenced him with ease. <br />Nevertheless, she herself was detained in custody, <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> suspecting that though the evidence had not been proven true neither was it necessarily false. </p>                        </div>

He himself was subdued and clearly deep in thought, though he feigned pleasure in the desultory conversation. Finally he ordered bandages to be prepared, and whatever else might help staunch the flow from bleeding wounds. <br />This alerted that same <a href=/people/12188 target=_blank>Milichus</a>, either aware of the conspiracy and so far loyal or, as the majority of historians relate, unaware and now possessed of his first suspicions. Regarding the sequel all agree. For when his slave’s mind inwardly considered the reward for treason, while at that moment the vision of immense riches and power hovered before his eyes, ideas of virtue, his master’s very life, and the memory of his own freedom having been granted were all forgotten. <br />Indeed, he also took his own wife’s advice, a woman’s and baser: she offered fear as a further motive, in that many of <a href=/people/12028 target=_blank>Scaevinus</a>’ freedmen and slaves had been present, and had witnessed the same: one man’s silence would prove of no avail, while he who first informed would reap the reward. </p>                        </div>

He also showed the weapon chosen for the murder, and requested the accused be summoned. <br /><a href=/people/12028 target=_blank>Scaevinus</a> was dragged there by the soldiers, and began his defence by maintaining that the weapon presented in evidence against him had long been revered by his family, was kept in his bedroom, and had been fraudulently taken by his freedman. As for his will, he re-sealed it many a day, without hiding the fact from observation. He had also granted his slaves liberty or gifts before, but more liberally on this occasion, because his means were now slender, and he was concerned about his will being challenged as his creditors were pressing. <br />Regarding his dinner table it had always been well provided for, he lived in a pleasant manner scarcely approved of by harsh critics. He had issued no orders involving bandages for wounds, but his accuser, whose other allegations were clearly idle, had therefore added a charge by which he could play informer and witness alike. <br />He continued, speaking firmly, accusing the man further of being an unspeakable disgrace, in so assured a tone and manner, that the evidence would have been discredited if <a href=/people/12188 target=_blank>Milichus</a>’ wife had not reminded her husband that <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> Natalis had conversed with <a href=/people/12028 target=_blank>Scaevinus</a> at length and in secret, and that both were intimates of Gaius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>. </p>                        </div>

At that moment, the father would have rushed to meet his daughter’s embrace, had not the lictors intervened and stopped them both. <br />The evidence was heard next; and whatever sympathy had been awakened by the savagery of the prosecution was matched by the anger roused against Publius <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a> in his role of witness. A client of <a href=/people/2786 target=_blank>Soranus</a>, bribed to bring about his friend’s destruction, he affected the gravity of the Stoic sect, being practised in displaying the look and manner of an honest man, while treacherous at heart and cunning, in order to conceal his avarice and lust. Bribery exposed those traits, and later he provided a cautionary example, not only against those veiled in deceit and stained with guilt, but those who fraudulently pretend to the arts of virtue, and prove false friends. </p>                        </div>
