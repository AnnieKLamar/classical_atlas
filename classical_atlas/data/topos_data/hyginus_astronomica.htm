Out of her zeal for hunting she joined <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, and was greatly loved by the goddess because of their similar temperaments. Later, when made pregnant by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>, she feared to tell the truth to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>. But she couldn't conceal it long, for as her womb grew heavier near the time of her delivery, when she was refreshing her tired body in a stream, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> realized she had not preserved her virginity. In keeping with her deep distrust, the goddess inflicted no light punishment. Taking away her maiden features, she changed her into the form of a bear, called arktos in Greek. In this form she bore <a href=/people/1105 target=_blank>Arcas</a>. </p>                        </div>

Questioned by <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> as to the reason for her swollen form, she replied that it was the goddess' fault, and because of this reply, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> changed her into the shape we mentioned above. When wandering like a wild beast in the forest, she was caught by certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aitolians</a> and brought into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> to King <a href=/people/717 target=_blank>Lycaon</a> along with her son as a gift, and there, in ignorance of the law, she is said to have rushed into the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375220SLyk class=place long=21.9954 lat=37.4484>Lycaeus</a>.

This reason has been handed down: Those who, at the beginning, observed the stars and supposed the number of stars into the several constellations, called this group no Bear but Wain, because two of the seven stars which seemed of equal size and closest together were considered <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and the other five were like the figure of a wagon. And so the sign which is nearest to this they wished to be called Bootes. We shall speak of him later on. <a href=/people/93 target=_blank>Aratus</a>, indeed, says that neither Bootes nor the Wain has these names for the reason above, but because the Bear seems, wagon-like, to wheel around the pole which is called North, and Bootes, is said to drive her. In this he seems to be considerably in error, for later, in connection with the seven stars, as <a href=/people/2644 target=_blank>Parmeniscus</a> says, twenty-five were grouped by certain astronomers to complete the form of the Bear, not seven. And so the one that followed the wagon and was formerly called Bootes, was now called Arctophylax [Bear Watchter], and she, at the same time that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> lived, was called Bear. About the Septentriones <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says that she was called both Bear and Wain; nowhere does he mention that Bootes was called Arctophylax. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> received permission from his father to bring back his mother <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a> from the Lower World, and in seeking a place of descent had come to the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>, a certain <a href=/people/12512 target=_blank>Hypolipnus</a> met him, a man worthy of that generation, who was to show the entrance to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> in answer to his request. However, when <a href=/people/12512 target=_blank>Hypolipnus</a> saw him, a mere boy in years, excelling all others in remarkable beauty of form, he asked from him the reward that could be given without loss. <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a>, however, eager for his mother, swore that if he brought her back, he would do as he wished, on terms, though, that a god could swear to a shameless man. At this, <a href=/people/12512 target=_blank>Hypolipnus</a> showed the entrance. So then, when <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> came to that place and was about to descend, he left the crown, which he had received as a gift from <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, at that place which in consequence is called <a href=/people/309 target=_blank>Stephanos</a>, for he was unwilling to take it with him for fear the immortal gift of the gods would be contaminated by contact with the dead. When he brought his mother back unharmed, he is said to have placed the crown in the stars as an everlasting memorial. </p>                        </div>

We shall speak later about him.

So when the dispute became one not about the girl but about the parentage of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, whether he was the son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> or not, <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> is said to have drawn a gold ring from his finger and cast it into the sea. He bade <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> bring it back, if he wanted him to believe he was a son of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>; as for himself, he could easily show he was a son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. So, invoking his father, he asked for some sign to prove he was his son, and straightway thunder and lightning gave token of assent. For a similar reason, <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, without any invoking of his father or obligation of an oath, cast himself into the sea. And at once a great swarm of <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphins</a>, tumbling forward over the sea, led him through gently swelling waves to the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>. From them he brought back the ring of <a href=/people/119 target=_blank>Minos</a> and a crown, bright with many gems, from <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, which she had received at her wedding as a gift from <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>. Others say that the crown came from the wife of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, and <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> is said to have given it to <a href=/people/421 target=_blank>Ariadne</a> as a gift, when on account of his valor and courage she was given to him in marriage.

When <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, moved by the beauty of <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, sought her in marriage, he couldn't win the consent of the timid maiden, but none the less kept planning to bring it about. At that time the <a href=/people/3048 target=_blank>Parcae</a> were said to have prophesied what the natural order of events should be. They said that the son of <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>' husband, whoever he might be, would be more famous than his father. <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> heard this as he kept watch, not from inclination but from necessity, and reported it to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a>. He, fearing that what he had done to his father <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> in a similar situation, would happened to him, namely, that he would be robbed of his power, gave up by necessity his desire to wed <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>, and out of gratitude to <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> thanked him and freed him from his chains. But he didn't go so far as to free him from all binding, since he had sworn to that, but for commemoration bade him bind his finger with the two things, namely, with stone and with iron. Following this practice men have rings fashioned of stone and iron, that they may seem to be appeasing <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a>. Some also have said that he wore a wreath, as if to claim that he as victor had sinned without punishment. And so men began the practice of wearing wreaths at times of great rejoicing and victory. You may observe this in sports and banquets. </p>                        </div>

The king, suspecting nothing, sent his daughters ahead; since he was busy with a state affair, he would come later. When this happened as <a href=/people/7938 target=_blank>Mastusius</a> wished, he killed the king's daughters, and mixing their blood with wine in a bowl, bade it be given as a drink to the king on his arrival. The king asked for his daughters, and when he learned what had happened, he ordered <a href=/people/7938 target=_blank>Mastusius</a> and the bowl to be thrown into the sea. The where he was thrown, to memorialize him is called Mastusian; the harbour still is called the Bowl. Astronomers of old pictured it in the stars, so that men might remember that no one can profit from an evil deed with impunity, nor can hostilities often be forgotten. Some, with <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>, say that it is the bowl <a href=/people/1088 target=_blank>Icarus</a> used when he showed wine to men; others the jar into which <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a> was thrown by <a href=/people/1687 target=_blank>Otus</a> and <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a>. </p>                        </div>
