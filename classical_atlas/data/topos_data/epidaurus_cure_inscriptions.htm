While looking at the tablets in the sanctuary he expressed incredulity regarding the cures and scoffed at the inscriptions. But in his sleep he saw a vision. It seemed to him that, as he was playing at dice below the temple and was about to cast the dice, the god appeared, sprang upon his hand, and stretched out his [the patient’s] fingers. When the god had stepped aside it seemed to him [the patient] that he [the patient] bent his hand and stretched out all his fingers one by one. When he had straightened them all, the god asked him if he would still be incredulous of the inscriptions on the tablets in the sanctuary. He answered that he would not. Since, then, formerly you were incredulous of the cures, though they were not incredible, for the future, he said, your name shall be Incredulous.

The boy, hearing this, put the pieces back in the bag and went on to the sanctuary. When he got there he opened the bag and brought the goblet out of it, and it was entirely whole; and he related to his master what had happened and had been said; when he [the master] heard that, he dedicated the goblet to the god. </p>                        </div>

In the course of my journey, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig class=place long=23.425 lat=37.75>Aegina</a>, the god told me not to be so irritable. When I arrived at the sanctuary, he told me for two days to keep my head covered, and for these two days it rained; to eat cheese and bread, celery with lettuce, to wash myself without help, to practise running, to take lemonpeels, to soak them in water, near the (spot of the) akoai in the bath to press against the wall, to take a walk in the upper portico, to take some passive exercise, to sprinkle myself with sand, to walk around barefoot, in the bathroom, before plunging into the hot water, to pour wine over myself, to bathe without help and to give an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> drachma to the bath attendant, to sacrifice in common to <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Asclepius</a>, Epione and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=demonym long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusinian</a> goddesses, to take milk with honey. When one day I had drunk milk alone he said, Put honey in the milk so that it can get through. When I asked of the god to relieve me more quickly I thought I walked out of the abaton near the (spot of the) akoai being anointed all over with mustard and salt, while a small boy was leading me holding a smoking censer, and the priest said: You are cured but you must pay up the thank-offerings. And I did what I had seen, and when I anointed myself with the salts and the moistened mustard I felt pains, but when I bathed I had no pain. That happened within nine days after I had come. He touched my right hand and also my breast. The following day as I was offering sacrifice the flame leapt up and scorched my hand, so that blisters appeared. Yet after a little the hand got well. As I stayed on he said I should use dill along with olive oil against my headaches. I usually did not suffer from headaches. But it happened that after I had studied, my head was congested. After I used the olive oil I got rid of the headache. To gargle with a cold gargle for the uvula — since about that too I had consulted the god — and the same also for the tonsils. He bade me also inscribe this. Full of gratitude I departed well. </p>                        </div>

Then Phlegyas, who dealt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=place long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurus</a>, his fatherland, married the daughter of Malus whom <a href=/people/1527 target=_blank>Erato</a>, her mother, bore, and her name was Cleophema. By Phlegyas then a child was begotten, and she was named Aegle; this was her name, but because of her beauty she was also called <a href=/people/1380 target=_blank>Coronis</a>. Then Phoebus of the golden bow, beholding her in the house of <a href=/people/5761 target=_blank>Malus</a>, ended her maidenhood. You went into her lovely bed, O golden-haired son of Leto.
