BOOK V On the Science of the Origin of Words, addressed to <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a><br />In what way names were applied to things in Latin, I have undertaken to expound, in six books. Of these, I have already composed three before this one, and have addressed them to Septumius; in them I treat of the branch of learning which is called Etymology. The considerations which might be raised against it, I have put in the first book; those adduced in its favour, in the second; those merely describing it, in the third. In the following books, addressed to you, I shall discuss the problem from what things names were applied in Latin, both those which are habitual with the ordinary folk, and those which are found in the poets. </p>                        </div>

Of these two matters I shall speak in the following books, not keeping them apart, but giving less attention to the second. </p>                        </div>

Not every word that is in use, has been applied without inaccuracy of some kind, nor does every word which has been applied correctly remain as it originally was; for many words are disguised by change of the letters. There are some whose origin is not from native words of our own language. Many words indicate one thing now, but formerly meant something else, as is the case with hostis 'enemy': for in olden times by this word they meant a foreigner from a country independent of Roman laws, but now they give the name to him whom they then called perduellis 'enemy.' </p>                        </div>

It is evident that we ought to operate in this way, because when we say inpos 'lacking power' in the nominative, it is less clear that it is from potentia 'power' than when we say inpotem in the accusative; and it becomes the more obscure, if you say pos 'having power' rather than inpos; for pos seems to mean rather pons 'bridge' than potens 'powerful.' </p>                        </div>

Whom you saw beautiful as a boy, him you see unsightly in his old age. The third generation does not see a person such as the first generation saw him. Therefore those that oblivion has taken away even from our ancestors, the painstaking of <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, though it has pursued the runaways, cannot bring back. As for me, even if I cannot track them down, I shall not be the slower for this, but even for this I shall be the swifter in the chase, if I can. For there is no slight darkness in the wood where these things are to be caught, and there are no trodden paths to the place which we wish to attain, nor do there fail to be obstacles in the paths, which could hold back the hunter on his way. </p>                        </div>

For the alterations come about by the loss or the addition of single letters and on account of the transposition or the change of them, and likewise by the lengthening or the shortening of syllables, and their addition or loss: since I have adequately shown by examples, in the preceding books, of what sort these phenomena are, I have thought that here I need only set a reminder of that previous discussion. </p>                        </div>

The lowest is that to which even the common folk has come; who does not see the sources of argentifodinae 'silver-mines' and of viocurus 'road-overseer'? The second is that to which old-time grammar has mounted, which shows how the poet has made each word which he has fashioned and derived. <br />Here belongs <a href=/people/1225 target=_blank>Pacuvius</a>'s: <br />The whistling of the ropes, here his <br />Incurvate-necked flock, here his <br />With his mantle he beshields his arm. </p>                        </div>

The fourth is that where the sanctuary is, and the mysteries of the high-priest: if I shall not arrive at full knowledge there, at any rate I shall cast about for a conjecture, which even in matters of our health the physician sometimes does when we are ill. </p>                        </div>

I have desired to go farther than those who expound only how the words of the poets are made up. For it did not seem meet that I seek the source in the case of the word which <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> had made, and neglect that which long before King <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> had made, in view of the fact that I get pleasure rather than utility from many words of the poets, and more utility than pleasure from the ancient words. And in fact are not those words mine which have come to me by inheritance from King <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, rather than those which were left behind by the poet <a href=/people/330 target=_blank>Livius</a>? </p>                        </div>

Therefore likewise there are the two fundamentals, station and motion, each divided into four kinds: what is stationary or is in motion, is body; where it is in motion, is place; while it is in motion, is time; what is inherent in the motion, is action.

From this, in the harvest, is the tritura 'threshing,' because then the grain teritur 'is rubbed out,' and the tribulum 'threshing-sledge,' with which it teritur 'is rubbed out.'

There should be no rebuking then of those who in examining a word add a letter or take one away, that what underlies this expression may be more easily perceived: just as, for instance, that the eyes may more easily see <a href=/people/5810 target=_blank>Myrmecides</a>' indistinct handiwork in ivory, men put black hairs behind the objects. </p>                        </div>

In the interpretation of the Hymns of the Saltans, which was made by <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a>, an outstanding scholar in Latin hterature, you will see that the interpretation is greatly furthered by attention to a single poor letter, and that much is obscured if such a letter is passed by. </p>                        </div>
