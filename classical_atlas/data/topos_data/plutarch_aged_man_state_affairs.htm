                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg117:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not ignorant, O <a href=/people/6478 target=_blank>Euphanes</a>, that you, being an extoller of <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, have often in your mouth this saying of his, as a thing well and to the purpose spoken by him: When as the combat's once agreed, Who by pretence seeks to be freed Obscures his virtue quite. But since sloth and effeminacy towards civil affairs, having many pretences, do for the last, as if it were drawn from the sacred line, tender to us old age, and thinking by this chiefly to abate and cool our honorable desire, allege that there is a certain decent dissolution, not only of the athletical, but also of the political period, or that there is in the revolution of our years a certain set and limited time, after which it is no more proper for us to employ ourselves in the conduct of the state than in the corporeal and robust exercises of youth; I esteem myself obliged to communicate also to you those sentiments of mine concerning old men's intermeddling with public matters, which I am ever and anon ruminating on by myself; so that neither of us may desert that long course we have to this day held together, nor rejecting the political life, which has been (as it were) an intimate friend of our own years, change it for another to which we are absolute strangers, and with which we have not time to become acquainted and familiar, but that we may persist in what we had chosen and have been inured to from the beginning, putting the same conclusion to our life and our living honorably; unless we would, by the short space of life we have remaining, disgrace that longer time we have already lived, as having been spent idly and in nothing that is commendable. For tyranny is not an honorable sepulchre, as one told <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, whose monarchy, obtained by and administered with injustice, did by its long continuance bring on him but a more perfect calamity; as <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> afterwards let his son know, when, seeing him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, of a tyrant become a private person, he said to him: How unworthy of thyself, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, thou actest! For thou oughtest not to live here at liberty and fearless with us, but to spend thy life, as thy father did, even to old age, immured within a tyrannical fortress. But the popular and legal government of a man accustomed to show himself no less profitable in obeying than in commanding is an honorable monument, which really adds to death the glory accruing from life. For this thing, as <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> says, goes last under the ground; unless it be in those in whom humanity and the love of honor die first, and whose zeal for goodness sooner decays than their covetousness after temporal necessaries; as if the soul had its active and divine parts weaker than those that are passive and corporeal; which it were neither honest to say, nor yet to admit from those who affirm that only of gaining we are never weary. But we ought to turn to a better purpose the saying of <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, and believe that it is not the desire of honor only that never grows old, but much more also the inclinations to society and affection to the state, which continue even in ants and <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> to the very last. For never did any one know a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> to become by age a drone, as some think it requisite of statesmen, of whom they expect that, when the vigor of their youth is past, they should retire and sit mouldy at home, suffering their active virtue to be consumed by idleness, as iron is by rust. For <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> excellently well said, that we ought not willingly to add the shame proceeding from vice to those many afflictions which old age has of its own. For of the many vices everywhere abounding, there is none which more disgraces an old man than sloth, delicacy, and effeminateness, when, retiring from the court and council, he mews himself up at home like a woman, or getting into the country oversees his reapers and gleaners; for of such a one we may say, Where's <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a>, and all his famous riddles? But as for him who should in his old age, and not before, begin to meddle with public matters, — as they say of <a href=/people/969 target=_blank>Epimenides</a>, that having fallen asleep while he was a young man, he awakened fifty years after, — and shaking off so long and so close-sticking a repose, should thrust himself, being unaccustomed and unexercised, into difficult and laborious employs, without having been experienced in civil affairs, or inured to the conversations of men, such a man may perhaps give occasion to one that would reprehend him, to say with the prophetess <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythia</a>: Thou com'st too late, seeking to govern in the state and rule the people, and at an unfit hour knocking at the palace gate, like an ill-bred guest coming late to a banquet, or a stranger, thou wouldst change, not thy place or region, but thy life for one of which thou hast made no trial. For that saying of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, The state instructs a man, is true in those who apply themselves to the business of the commonweal whilst they have yet time to be taught, and to learn a science which is scarce attained with much labor through many strugglings and negotiations, even when it timely meets with a nature that can easily undergo toil and difficulty. These things seem not to be impertinently spoken against him who in his old age begins to act in the management of the state. </p>                        </div>

For the being unused to boldness and the want of experience are not so much to every soldier. . . . [Here is a defect in the original.] But <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, when above eighty years of age he was to plead his own cause, said, that it was a difficult thing for a man to make his apology and justify his life before others than those with whom he had lived and been conversant. All men indeed confess, that the actions of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus Caesar</a>, when he had defeated <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, were no less royal and useful to the public towards the end of his life, than any he had done before. And himself severely reprehending the dissoluteness of young men by establishing good customs and laws, when they raised an uproar, he only said to them: Young men, refuse not to hear an old man, to whom old men not unwillingly gave ear when he was young. The government also of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> exerted itself with most vigor in his old age, when he both persuaded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to make war, and at another time, when they were eagerly bent unseasonably to go forth and fight sixty thousand armed men withstood and hindered them, sealing up in a manner the arms of the people and the keys of the gates. Now as for what <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> has written of <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, it is fit it should be set down in his own words. What youth, says he, was ever so gallant but that his old age surpassed it? Who was ever so terrible to his enemies in the very flower of his virility, as <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> in the declension of his days? At whose death were adversaries ever seen more joyful than at that of <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, though he departed not this life till he was stooping under the burden of his years? Who more emboldened his confederates than <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, though being at the utmost period of his life? What young man was ever missed more by his friends than <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, who died not till he was very old? </p>                        </div>

Since <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> in his old age gained the victory by his choral songs, as the epigram testifies in these concluding verses: Fourscore years old was <a href=/people/3872 target=_blank>Leoprepes</a>' son, <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, when he this glory won. And it is said of <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a>, that, to avoid being condemned of dotage at the instance of his children, he repeated the entrance song of the Chorus in his tragedy of <a href=/people/173 target=_blank>Oidipus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKol class=place long=23.7219 lat=37.9991>Colonus</a>, which begins thus: Welcome, stranger, come in time To the best place of this clime, White <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKol class=place long=23.7219 lat=37.9991>Colonus</a>, which abounds With brave <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. In these grounds, Spread with Nature's choicest green, Philomel is often seen. Here she her hearers charms with sweetest lays, Whilst with shrill throat And warbling note She moans the sad misfortunes of her former days: and that, this song appearing admirable, he was dismissed from the court, as from the theatre, with the applause and acclamations of all that were present. And this short verse is acknowledged to be written of him: When <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> framed for <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> This ode, his years were fifty-five. <a href=/people/638 target=_blank>Philemon</a> also the comedian and <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a> were snatched away by death, whilst they were acting on the stage and crowned with garlands. And as for <a href=/people/1567 target=_blank>Polus</a> the tragedian, <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> and <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochorus</a> related of him that, being seventy years of age, he a little before his death acted in four days eight tragedies. </p>                        </div>

For to descend from the state of a prince to that of a ploughman is all over base and mean. For since <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> says that the <a href=/people/11003 target=_blank>Paralus</a>, being a sacred galley, was unworthily used in being employed to carry timber, pales, and <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to <a href=/people/2532 target=_blank>Midias</a>; would not a man who should, after his having quitted the office of superintendent at the public solemnities, governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a>, or president in the council of the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphictyons</a>, be seen measuring of corn, weighing of raisins, and bargaining about fleeces and wool-fells, — would not such a one, I say, wholly seem to have brought on himself, as the proverb has it, the old age of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, without any one's necessitating him to it? For to set one's self to mechanical employments and trafficking, after one has borne office in the state, is the same as if one should strip a well-bred virtuous gentlewoman out of her matron-like attire, and thrust her with an apron tied about her into a public victualling-house. For the dignity and greatness of political virtue is overthrown, when it is debased to such mean administrations and traffics for gain. But if (which is the only thing remaining) they shall, by giving effeminacies and voluptuousness the name of living at quiet and enjoying one's self, exhort a statesman leisurely to waste away and grow old in them, I know not to which of the two shameful pictures his life will seem to have the greater resemblance, — whether to the mariners who, leaving their ship for the future not in the harbor but under sail, spend all their time in celebrating the feasts of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>; or to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, whom some painters merrily but yet ridiculously represent wearing in <a href=/people/1144 target=_blank>Omphale</a>'s palace a yellow petticoat, and giving himself up to be boxed and combed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> damsels. So shall we, stripping a statesman of his <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s-skin, and seating him at a luxurious table, there be always cloying his palate with delicacies, and filling his ears with effeminate songs and music; being not a whit put to the blush by the saying of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Great to <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, who after his public services both in camp and council, addicted himself to bathing, feasting, conversing with women in the day, and much other dissoluteness, even to the raising and extravagantly furnishing of sumptuous buildings, and who, once upbraiding <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> with an ambition and desire of rule unsuitable to his age, was by him answered, that it was more misbecoming an old man to live voluptuously than to govern? The same <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, when in his sickness his physician had prescribed him the eating of a thrush, which was then hard to be got, as being out of season, being told that <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> bred great store of such birds, would not send to him for one, but said: What!

For not only <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> to old men is averse, as <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> has it; but their appetite also to their meat and drink is for the most part dull, and as one would say, toothless; so that they have but little gust and relish in them. They ought therefore to furnish themselves with pleasures of the mind, not ungenerous or illiberal, like those of <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, who said to those who reproached him with covetousness, that being by his years deprived of other pleasures, he recreated his old age with the only delight which remained, that of heaping up riches. But political life has in it pleasures exceeding great, and no less honorable, being such as it is probable the very Gods do only or at least chiefly enjoy themselves in; and these are the delights which proceed from doing good and performing what is honest and laudable. For if <a href=/people/12458 target=_blank>Nicias</a> the painter took such pleasure in the work of his hands, that he often was fain to ask his servants whether he had washed or dined; and if <a href=/people/848 target=_blank>Archimedes</a> was so intent upon the table in which he drew his geometrical figures, that his attendants were obliged by force to pluck him from it and strip him of his clothes that they might anoint him, whilst he in the mean time drew new schemes on his anointed body; and if <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a> the piper, whom you also know, was wont to say that men knew not how much more he delighted himself with his playing than he did others, for that then his hearers would rather demand of him than give him a reward; do we not thence conceive how great pleasures the virtues afford to those who practise them, from their honest actions and public-spirited works tending to the benefit of human society? They do not tickle or weaken, as do such sweet and gentle motions as are made on the flesh; for these indeed have a furious and unconstant itching, mixed with a feverish inflammation; whereas those which accompany such gallant actions as he who rightly administers the state is worker of, not like the golden plumes of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, but like those celestial wings of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, elevate the soul which has received a greatness of courage and wisdom accompanied with joy. </p>                        </div>

For be it indeed so, as <a href=/people/62 target=_blank>Xenophon</a> says, that there is no sound more pleasing than one's own praises; yet there is no sight, remembrance, or consideration which gives a man so much satisfaction as the contemplation of his own actions, performed by him in offices of magistracy, and management of the state, in eminent and public places. It is moreover true, that the courteous thanks attending as a witness on such virtuous acts, and the emulous praise conferred on them, which is as a guide conducting us in the way of just benevolence, add a certain lustre and shining gloss to the joy of virtue. Neither ought a man negligently to suffer his glory to wither in his old age, like a wrestler's garland; but, by adding always something new and fresh, he should awaken, meliorate, and confirm the grace of his former actions. For as those workmen on whom was incumbent the charge of keeping in repair the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=demonym long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delian</a> ship, by supplying and putting into the place of the decayed planks and timber others that were new and sound, seem to have preserved it from ancient times, as if it were eternal and incorruptible; so the preserving and upholding of one's glory is as the keeping in of a fire, a work of no difficulty, as requiring only to be supplied with a little fuel, but when either of them is wholly extinct and suppressed, one cannot without great labor rekindle it again. <a href=/people/1162 target=_blank>Lampis</a>, the sea commander, being asked how he got his wealth, answered: My greatest estate I gained easily enough, but the smaller slowly and with much labor. In like manner, it is not easy at the beginning to acquire reputation and power in the state; but to augment and conserve it, when it is grown great, is not at all hard for those who have obtained it. For neither does a friend, when he is once had, require many and great services that he may so continue, but assiduity does by small signs preserve his good-will; nor do the friendship and confidence of the people expect to have a man always bestowing largesses, defending their causes, or executing of magistracy, but they are maintained by a readiness, and by not failing or being weary of carefulness and solicitude for the public. For even wars themselves have not alway conflicts, fights, and sieges; but there sometimes intervene sacrifices and parleys, and abundance of leisure for sports and pastimes. Whence then comes it, that the administration of the commonwealth should be feared as inconsolable, laborious, and unsupportable, where theatres, processions, largesses, music, joy, and at every turn the service and festival of some God or other, unbending the brows of every council and senate, yield a manifold pleasure and delight? </p>                        </div>

For <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> indeed, as <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a> has it, bark at a stranger whom they do not know; and envy opposes him who is a beginner on the very steps of the tribune, hindering his access, but she meekly bears an accustomed and familiar glory, and not churlishly or difficultly. Wherefore some resemble envy to smoke; for it arises thick at first, when the fire begins to burn; but when the flame grows clear, it vanishes away. Now men usually quarrel and contend about other excellences, as virtue, nobility, and honor, as if they were of opinion that they took from themselves as much as they give to others; but the precedency of time, which is properly called by the Greeks Πϱεσβεῖον (or the honor of old age), is free from jealousy, and willingly granted by men to their companions. For to no honor is it so incident to grace the honorer more than the honored, as to that which is given to persons in years. Moreover, all men do not expect to gain themselves authority from wealth, eloquence, or wisdom; but as for the reverence and glory to which old age brings men, there is not any one of those who act in the management of the state but hopes to attain it. He therefore who, having a long time contended against envy, shall when it ceases and is appeased withdraw himself from the state, and together with public actions desert communities and societies, differs nothing from that pilot who, having kept his ship out at sea when in danger of being overwhelmed by contrary and tempestuous waves and winds, seeks to put into harbor as soon as ever the weather is grown calm and favorable. For the longer time there has been, the more friends and companions he has made; all which he cannot carry out with him, as a singing-master does his choir, nor is it just to leave them. But as it is not easy to root up old trees, so neither is it to extirpate a long-continued practice in the management of the state, which having many roots is involved in a tangled mass of affairs, which create more troubles and vexations to those who retire from them than to those who continue in them. And if there is any remainder of envy and emulation against old men from former contentions about civil affairs, they should rather extinguish it by authority, than turn their backs on it and go away naked and disarmed. For envious persons do not so much assail those who contend against them, as they do by contempt insult over such as retire. </p>                        </div>

So an old man speaking to the people, acting in the state, and honored, is a venerable spectacle; but he who wastes away his days in his bed, or sits discoursing of trivial matters and wiping his nose in the corner of a gallery, easily renders himself an object of contempt. And this indeed <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> himself teaches those who hear him aright. For <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a>, who fought before <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, was highly venerated and esteemed; whilst <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> and <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>, who stayed at home, were slighted and despised. For the habit of prudence does not continue the same in those who give themselves to their ease; but by little and little diminishes and is dissolved by sloth, as always requiring some exercise of the thought to rouse up and purify the rational, active faculty of the soul. For, Like glittering brass, by being used it shines. For the infirmity of the body does not so much incommode the administrations of those who, almost spent with age, go to the tribune or to the council of war, as they are advantageous by the caution and prudence which attend their years, and keep them from thrusting themselves precipitately into affairs, abused partly by want of experience and partly by vain-glory, and hurrying the people along with them by violence, like a sea agitated by the winds; causing them mildly and moderately to manage those with whom they have to do. Whence cities, when they are in adversity and fear, desire the government of grave and ancient personages; and often having drawn out of his field some old man who had not so much as the least thought of it, have compelled him, though unwilling, to put his hand to the helm, and conduct the ship of the state into the haven of security, rejecting generals and orators, who not only knew how to speak loud and make long harangues without drawing their breath, but were able also valiantly to march forth and fight their enemies. So when the orators one day at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, before <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> and <a href=/people/210 target=_blank>Iphicrates</a> uncovering <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a> the son of <a href=/people/8396 target=_blank>Theochares</a>, a vigorous and stout-bodied young man, said they were of opinion that the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> ought to be such a one; Not so, by all the Gods, answered <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>, but such a one he should be that is to carry the general's bedding; but the general himself ought to be such a one as can at the same time see both forwards and backwards, and will suffer not his reasonings about things convenient to be disturbed by any passion. <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> indeed said, he was glad that he was got free from the tyranny of wanton love, as being a furious and raging master; but in the administrations of state, we are not to avoid this one only master, the love of women or boys, but many who are madder than he, such as obstinacy in contending ambition, and a desire of being always the first and greatest, which is a disease most fruitful in bringing forth envy, jealousy, and conspiracies; some of which vices old age abates and dulls, while it wholly extinguishes and cools the others, not so much detracting from the practical impulse of the mind, as repressing its impetuous and over-hot passions, that it may apply a sober and settled reasoning to its considerations about the management of affairs. </p>                        </div>

For it is besides altogether unreasonable and absurd, that he who has in his youth leaped into the tribunal should, after he has discharged all his furious ambitions and impetuous passions on the public, when he is come to that maturity of years which by experience brings prudence, desert and abandon the commonwealth, having abused it as if it were a woman. </p>                        </div>

For as, if we were obliged to persevere in the practice of singing to the end of our days, it would behoove us, being now grown old, of the many tones and tensions there are of the voice, which the musicians call harmonies, not to aim at the highest and shrillest, but to make choice of that in which there is an easiness joined with a decent suitableness; so, since it is more natural for men to act and speak even to the end of their lives, than for swans to sing, we must not reject action, like a harp that is set too high, but rather let it a little down, accommodating it to such employs in the state as are easy, moderate, and fitting for men in years. For neither do we suffer our bodies to be altogether motionless and unexercised because we cannot any longer make use of spades and plummets, nor yet throw quoits or skirmish in armor, as we have formerly done; but some of us do by swinging and walking, others by playing gently at ball, and some again by discoursing, stir up our spirits and revive our natural heat. Therefore neither let us permit ourselves to be wholly chilled and frozen by idleness, nor yet on the contrary let us, by burthening ourselves with every office or intermeddling with every public business, force on old age, convinced of its disability, to break forth into these exclamations: The spear to brandish, thou, right hand, art bent; But weak old age opposes thy intent. Since even that man is not commended who, in the vigor and strength of his years, imposing all public affairs in general on himself, and unwilling to leave any thing for another (as the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> say of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>), thrusts himself into all employs, and intermeddles in every business, through an insatiable desire of glory, or through envy against those who are in some measure partakers of honor and authority in the state. But to an old man, though you should free him from the infamy, yet painful and miserable would be an ambition always laying wait at every election of magistrates, a curiosity attending for every opportunity of judicature or assembling in counsel, and a humor of vain-glory catching at every embassy and patronage. For the doing of these things, even with the favor and good liking of every one, is too heavy for that age. And yet the contrary to this happens; for they are hated by the young men, as leaving them no occasions of action, nor suffering them to put themselves forth; and their ambitious desire of primacy and rule is no less odious to others than the covetousness and voluptuousness of other old men. </p>                        </div>

For indeed he who is to oversee others that are performing their exercise or fighting for prizes cannot judge at the same exercise and fight himself. Thus he who instructs a young man in public affairs and negotiations of the state, and prepares him both to speak well and act heroicly for the service of his country, is in no small or mean degree useful to the commonwealth, but in that at which <a href=/people/12417 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> chiefly and principally aimed himself, when he accustomed young men to persist in obedience to every one that was elder, as if he were a lawgiver. For to what, think you, had <a href=/people/107 target=_blank>Lysander</a> respect, when he said that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a> men most honorably grew old? Was it because old men could most honorably grow old there enjoying idleness, putting out money to use, sitting together at tables, and after their game taking a cheerful cup? You will not, I believe, say any such thing. But it was because all such men, being after some sort in the place of magistrates, fatherly governors, or tutors of youth, inspected not only the public affairs, but also made inquiry — and that not slightly — into every action of the younger men, both as concerning their exercises, recreations, and diet, being terrible indeed to offenders, but venerable and desirable to the good. For young men indeed always venerate and follow those who increase and cherish the neatness and generosity of their disposition without any envy. </p>                        </div>

Therefore a statesman that is in years must be very far from being envious, and not act like those old trees and stocks which, as with a certain charm, manifestly withdraw the nutritive juice from such young plants as grow near them or spring up under them, and hinder their growth; but he should kindly admit and even offer himself to those that apply themselves to him and seek to converse with him, directing, leading, and educating them, not only by good instructions and counsels, but also by affording them the means of administering such public affairs as may bring them honor and repute, and executing such unprejudicial commissions as will be pleasing and acceptable to the multitude. But for such things as, being untoward and difficult, do like medicines at first gripe and molest, but afterwards yield honor and profit, — upon these things he ought not to put young men, nor expose those who are inexperienced to the mutinous clamors of the rude and ill-natured multitude, but he should rather take the odium upon himself for such things as (though harsh and unpleasing) may yet prove beneficial to the commonwealth; for this will render the young men both more affectionate to him, and more cheerful in the undertaking other services. </p>                        </div>

For they say, as <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> affirmed, that they who fetch turns to and fro in galleries walk, but not they who go into the country or to visit a friend. But the being a statesman is like the being a philosopher. Wherefore <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> did philosophize, not only when he neither placed benches nor seated himself in his chair, nor kept the hour of conference and walking appointed for his disciples, but also when, as it happened, he played, drank, went to war with some, bargained, finally, even when he was imprisoned and drank the poison; having first shown that man's life does at all times, in every part, and universally in all passions and actions, admit of philosophy. The same also we are to understand of civil government, to wit, that fools do not administer the state, even when they lead forth armies, write dispatches and edicts, or make speeches to the people; but that they either endeavor to insinuate themselves into the favor of the vulgar and become popular, seek applause by their harangues, raise seditions and disturbances, or at the best perform some service, as compelled by necessity. But he that seeks the public good, loves his country and fellow-citizens, has a serious regard to the welfare of the state, and is a true commonwealthsman, such a one, though he never puts on the military garment or senatorial robe, is yet always employed in the administration of the state, by inciting to action those who are able, guiding and instructing those that want it, assisting and advising those that ask counsel, deterring and reclaiming those that are ill-given, and confirming and encouraging those that are well-minded; so that it is manifest, he does not for fashion's sake apply himself to the public affairs, nor go then to the theatre or council when there is any haste or when he is sent for by name, that he may have the first place there, being otherwise present only for his recreation, as when he goes to some show or a concert of music; but on the contrary, though absent in body, yet is he present in mind, and being informed of what is done, approves some things and disapproves others. </p>                        </div>

And <a href=/people/150 target=_blank>Epaminondas</a> indeed, being general, performed many and great actions; but yet there is related an exploit of his, not inferior to any of them, performed about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> when he had neither command in the army nor office in the state. For, when the commanders, having through inadvertency drawn a squadron into a difficult and disadvantageous ground, were in amaze, for that the enemies pressed hard upon them, galling them with their arrows, he, being called up from amongst the heavyarmed foot, first by his encouraging them dissipated the trouble and fright of the army, and then, having ranged and brought into order that squadron whose ranks had been broken, he easily disengaged them out of those straits, and placed them in front against their enemies, who, thereupon changing their resolutions, marched off.

Now <a href=/people/175 target=_blank>Agis</a>, hearing him, took his advice, and at that present retreated; but afterwards got the victory. And there was every day a chair set for him before the doors of the government house, and the Ephori, often rising from their consistory and going to him, asked his advice and consulted him about the greatest and most important affairs; for he was esteemed very prudent, and is recorded to have been a man of great sense. And therefore, having now wholly exhausted the strength of his body, and being for the most part tied to his bed, when the Ephori sent for him to the common hall of the city, he strove to get up and go to them; but walking heavily and with great difficulty, and meeting by the way certain boys, he asked them whether they knew any thing stronger than the necessity of obeying their master; and they answering him that inability was of greater force, he, supposing that this ought to be the limit of his service, turned back again homewards. For a readiness and good will to serve the public ought not to fail, whilst ability lasts; but when that is once gone, it is no longer to be forced. And indeed <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, both in war and peace, always used Caius <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> for a counsellor; insomuch that some said, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> was the actor of those noble exploits, and Caius the poet or author. And <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> himself confessed, that the honorablest and greatest of his counsels, by the right performance of which he in his consulship preserved his country, were concerted with Publius <a href=/people/734 target=_blank>Nigidius</a> the philosopher. </p>                        </div>
