For thus commands my queen, woman in passionate heart and man in strength of purpose. And whenever I make here my bed, restless and dank with dew and unvisited by dreams — for instead of sleep fear stands ever by my side, so that I cannot close my eyelids fast in sleep — and whenever I care to sing or hum (and thus apply an antidote of song to ward off drowsiness), then my tears start forth, as I bewail the fortunes of this house of ours, not ordered for the best as in days gone by. But tonight may there come a happy release from my weary task! May the fire with its glad tidings flash through the gloom! (The signal fire suddenly flashes out.] <br />Oh welcome, you blaze in the night, a light as if of day, you harbinger of many a choral dance in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> in thanksgiving for this glad event! What ho! What ho! To <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s queen I thus cry aloud the signal to rise from her bed, and as quickly as she can to lift up in her palace halls a shout of joy in welcome of this fire, if the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> truly is taken, as this beacon unmistakably announces. And I will make an overture with a dance upon my own account; for my lord's lucky roll I shall count to my own score, now that this beacon has thrown me triple six. <br />Ah well, may the master of the house come home and may I clasp his welcome hand in mine! For the rest I stay silent; a great <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> stands upon my tongue — yet the house itself, could it but speak, might tell a plain enough tale; since, for my part, by my own choice I have words for those who know, and to those who do not know, I've lost my memory.

Even so <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, whose power is over all, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, lord of host and guest, sends against <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the sons of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, that for the sake of a woman with many husbands he may inflict many and wearying struggles (when the knee is pressed in the dust and the spear is splintered in the onset) on Danaan and on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> alike. <br />The case now stands where it stands — it moves to fulfilment at its destined end. Not by offerings burned in secret, not by secret libations, not by tears, shall man soften the stubborn wrath of unsanctified sacrifices. <br />But we, incapable of service by reason of our aged frame, discarded from that martial mustering of long ago, wait here at home, supporting on our canes a strength like a child's. For just as the vigor of youth, leaping up within the breast, is like that of old age, since the war-god is not in his place; so extreme age, its leaves already withering, goes its way on triple feet, and, no better than a child, wanders, a dream that is dreamed by day. <br />But, O daughter of <a href=/people/7021 target=_blank>Tyndareos</a>, Queen <a href=/people/595 target=_blank>Clytaemestra</a>, what has happened? What news do you have? On what intelligence and convinced by what report do you send about your messengers to command sacrifice? For all the gods our city worships, the gods supreme [hypaton], the gods below [chthonian], the gods of the heavens [ouranion] and of the marketplace [agoraion], have their altars ablaze with offerings. Now here, now there, the flames rise high as heaven, yielding to the soft and guileless persuasion of holy ointment, the sacrificial oil itself brought from the inner chambers of the palace. Of all this declare whatever you can and dare reveal, and be a healer of my uneasy heart. This now at one moment bodes ill, while then again hope, shining with kindly light from the sacrifices, wards off the biting care of the sorrow that gnaws my heart. </p>                        </div>

Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail! <br />Then the wise seer of the host, noticing how the two warlike sons of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> were two in temper, recognized the devourers of the hare as the leaders of the army, and thus interpreted the portent and spoke: In time those who here issue forth shall seize <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s town, and fate shall violently ravage before its towered walls all the public store of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>.

For, in her pity, holy <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> is angry at the winged <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> of her father, for they sacrifice a wretched timorous thing, together with her young, before she has brought them forth.

And I implore Paean, the healer, that she may not raise adverse gales with long delay to stay the Danaan fleet from putting forth, by urging another sacrifice, one that knows no law, unsuited for feast, worker of family strife, dissolving wife's reverence for husband. For there abides wrath — terrible, not to be suppressed, a treacherous guardian of the home, a wrath that never forgets and that exacts vengeance for a child. <br />Such utterances of doom, derived from auguries on the march, together with many blessings, did <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a> proclaim to the royal house; and in harmony with this.

In anxious fear I wait to hear something shrouded still in gloom. The gods are not blind to men with blood upon their hands. In the end the black Spirits of Vengeance bring to obscurity that one who has prospered in unrighteousness and wear down his fortunes by reverse. Once a man is among the unseen, there is no more help for him. <a href=/people/1497 target=_blank>Glory</a> in excess is fraught with peril; the lofty peak is struck by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>' thunderbolt. I choose prosperity unassailed by envy. May I not be a sacker of cities, and may I not myself be despoiled and live to see my own life in another's power!

Our labor's past; past for the dead so that they will never care even to wake to life again.

But when the radiant light of the sun rose we beheld the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean</a> flowering with corpses of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=demonym long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaean</a> men and wreckage of ships. Ourselves, however, and our ship, its hull unshattered, some power, divine not human, preserved by stealth or intercession, laying hand upon its helm; and Savior <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> chose to sit aboard our craft so that it should neither take in the swelling surf at anchorage nor drive upon a rock-bound coast. Then, having escaped death upon the deep, in the clear bright day, scarce crediting our fortune, we brooded in anxious thought over our late mischance, our fleet distressed and sorely buffeted.

But <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>'s city has learned, in her old age, an altered strain, and now, I trust, wails a loud song, full of lamentation, calling <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> evil-wed; for she has born the burden of a life in which everything was destroyed, a life full of lamentation because of the wretched slaughter of her sons. <br />Even so a man reared in his house a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s whelp, robbed of its mother's milk yet still desiring the breast. Gentle it was in the prelude of its life, kindly to children, and a delight to the old. Much did it get, held in arms like a nursling child, with its bright eye turned toward his hand, and fawning under compulsion of its belly's need. <br />But brought to full growth by time it showed the nature it had from its parents. Unbidden, as payment for its fostering, it prepared a feast with ruinous slaughter of the flocks; so that the house was defiled with blood, and whose who lived there could not control their anguish, and great was the carnage far and wide. A priest of ruin, by order of a god, it was reared in the house. <br />At first, I would say, there came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> the spirit of unruffled calm, a delicate ornament of wealth, a darter of soft glances from the eye, love's flower that stings the heart. Then, swerving from her course, she brought her marriage to a bitter end, sped on to the children of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> under escort of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, the warder of host and guest, ruining her sojourn and her companions, a vengeful Fury who brought tears to brides. </p>                        </div>

It is the evil deed that afterwards begets more iniquity like its own breed; but when a house is righteous, the lot of its children is blessed always. <br />But an old Hubris tends to bring forth in evil men, sooner or later, at the fated hour of birth, a young Hubris and that irresistible, unconquerable, unholy spirit, Recklessness, and for the household black Curses, which resemble their parents. <br />But Righteousness shines in smoke-begrimed dwellings and esteems the virtuous man. From gilded mansions, where men's hands are foul, she departs with averted eyes and makes her way to pure homes; she does not worship the power of wealth stamped counterfeit by the praise of men, and she guides all things to their proper end.

Every one is ready to heave a sigh over the unfortunate, but no sting of true sorrow reaches the heart; and in seeming sympathy they join in others' joy, forcing their faces into smiles. But whoever is a discerning shepherd of his flock cannot be deceived by men's eyes which, while they feign loyalty of heart, only fawn upon him with watery affection. <br />Now in the past, when you marshaled the army in <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>'s cause, you were depicted in my eyes (for I will not hide it from you) most ungracefully and as not rightly guiding the helm of your mind in seeking through your sacrifices to bring courage to dying men. </p>                        </div>

But, touching your sentiments — which I heard and still bear in memory — I both agree and you have in me an advocate.

For the venom of malevolence settles upon the heart and doubles the burden of him who suffers from that plague: he is himself weighed down by his own calamity, and groans to see another's prosperity. From knowledge — for well I know the mirror of companionship — I may call a shadow of a shade those who feigned exceeding loyalty to me. Only <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, the very man who sailed against his will, once harnessed, proved my zealous yoke-fellow. This I affirm of him whether he is alive or dead. <br />But, for the rest, in what concerns the State and public worship, we shall appoint open debates and consider. Where all goes well, we must take counsel so that it may long endure; but whenever there is need of healing remedy, we will by kind appliance of cautery or the knife endeavor to avert the mischief of the disease. <br />And now I will pass to my palace halls and to my household hearth, and first of all pay greeting to the gods. They who sent me forth have brought me home again. May victory, now that it has attended me, remain ever with me constant to the end!

First and foremost, it is a terrible evil for a wife to sit forlorn at home, severed from her husband, always hearing many malignant rumors, and for one messenger after another to come bearing tidings of disaster, each worse than the last, and cry them to the household. And as for wounds, had my husband received so many as rumor kept pouring into the house, no net would have been pierced so full of holes as he. Or if he had died as often as reports claimed, then truly he might have had three bodies, a second <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a>, and have boasted of having taken on him a triple cloak of earth [ample that above, of that below I speak not], one death for each different shape.

Yet still my soul within me, self-inspired, intones the lyreless dirge of the avenging spirit, and cannot wholly win its customary confidence of hope. Not for nothing is my bosom disquieted as my heart throbs against my justly fearful breast in eddying tides that warn of some event. But I pray that my expectation may fall out false and not come to fulfilment. <br />Truly blooming health does not rest content within its due bounds; for disease ever presses close against it, its neighbor with a common wall. So human fortune, when holding onward in straight course strikes upon a hidden reef. And yet, if with a well-measured throw, caution heaves overboard a portion of the gathered wealth, the whole house, with woe overladen, does not founder nor engulf the hull. Truly the generous gift from <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, rich and derived from yearly furrows, makes an end of the plague of famine. </p>                        </div>

At last the hour has come when I can say that the gods who avenge mortal men look down from on high upon the crimes of earth.

And when he had come back as a suppliant to his hearth, unhappy <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a> secured such safety for his lot as not himself to suffer death and stain with his blood his native soil. But <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a>, the godless father of this slain man, with welcome more hearty than kind, on the pretence that he was cheerfully celebrating a happy day by serving meat, served up to my father as entertainment a banquet of his own children's flesh. The toes and fingers he broke off . . . sitting apart. And when all unwittingly my father had quickly taken servings that he did not recognize, he ate a meal which, as you see, has proved fatal to his race. Now, discovering his unhallowed deed, he uttered a great cry, reeled back, vomiting forth the slaughtered flesh, and invoked an unbearable curse upon the line of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a>, kicking the banquet table to aid his curse, thus perish all the race of <a href=/people/3114 target=_blank>Pleisthenes</a>! This is the reason that you see this man fallen here. I am he who planned this murder and with justice. For together with my hapless father he drove me out, me his third child, as yet a baby in swaddling-clothes. But grown to manhood, justice has brought me back again. Exile though I was, I laid my hand upon my enemy, compassing every device of cunning to his ruin.
