It is morning and the new-risen sun is bright. The PAEDAGOGUS enters on the left of the spectators, accompanied by the two youths, ORESTES and PYLADES.) <br />PAEDAGOGUS: SON of him who led our hosts at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> of old, son of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>!- now thou mayest behold with thine eyes all that thy soul hath desired so long. There is the ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> of thy yearning,- the hallowed grove whence the gadfly drove the daughter of <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a>; and there, <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, is the <a href=/people/3875 target=_blank>Lycean</a> agora, named from the wolf-slaying god; there, on the left, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228SHer class=place long=22.7747 lat=37.6919>famous temple</a>; and in this place to which we have come, deem that thou seest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a> rich in gold, with the house of the <br /><a href=/people/2179 target=_blank>Pelopidae</a> there, so often stained with bloodshed; whence I carried thee of yore, from the slaying of thy father, as thy kinswoman, thy sister, charged me; and saved thee, and reared thee up to manhood, to be the avenger of thy murdered sire. <br />Now, therefore, <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, and thou, best of friends, <a href=/people/663 target=_blank>Pylades</a>, our plans must be laid quickly; for lo, already the sun's bright ray is waking the songs of the birds into clearness, and the dark night of stars is spent. Before, then, anyone comes forth from the house, take counsel; seeing that the time allows not of delay, but is full ripe for deeds. </p>                        </div>

As a steed of generous race, though old, loses not courage in danger, but pricks his ear, even so thou urgest us forward, and art foremost in our support. I will tell thee, then, what I have determined; listen closely to my words, and correct me, if I miss the mark in aught. <br />When I went to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> oracle, to learn how I might avenge my father on his murderers, <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> gave me the response which thou art now to hear:- that alone, and by stealth, without aid of arms or numbers, I should snatch the righteous vengeance of my hand. Since, then, the god spake to us on this wise, thou must go into yonder house, when opportunity gives thee entrance, and learn all that is passing there, so that thou mayest report to us from sure knowledge. <br />Thine age, and the lapse of time, will prevent them from recognising thee; they will never suspect who thou art, with that silvered hair. <br />Let thy tale be that thou art a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=demonym long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocian</a> stranger, sent by <a href=/people/8145 target=_blank>Phanoteus</a>; for he is the greatest of their allies. Tell them, and confirm it with thine oath, that <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> hath perished by a fatal chance, hurled at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> games from his rapid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384224BHip class=place long=22.43 lat=38.446>chariot</a>; be that the substance of thy story. <br />We, meanwhile, will first crown my father's tomb, as the god enjoined, with drink-offerings and the luxuriant tribute of severed hair; then come back, bearing in our hands an urn of shapely bronze, now hidden in the brushwood, as I think thou knowest, so to gladden them with the false tidings that this my body is no more, but has been consumed with fire and turned to ashes. Why should the omen trouble me, when by a feigned death I find life indeed, and win renown? I trow, no word is ill-omened, if fraught with gain. Often ere now have I seen wise men die in vain report; then, when they return home, they are held in more abiding honour: as I trust that from this rumour I also shall emerge in radiant life, and yet shine like a star upon my foes. <br />O my fatherland, and ye gods of the land, receive me with good fortune in this journey,- and ye also, halls of my fathers, for I come with divine mandate to cleanse you righteously; send me not dishonoured from the land, but grant that I may rule over my possessions, and restore my house! <br />Enough;- be it now thy care, old man, to go and heed thy task; and we twain will go forth; for so occasion bids, chief ruler of every enterprise for men. <br />ELECTRA (within) Ah me, ah me! <br />PAEDAGOGUS: Hark, my son,- from the doors, methought, came the sound of some handmaid moaning within. <br />ORESTES: Can it be the hapless <a href=/people/388 target=_blank>Electra</a>? Shall we stay here, and listen to her laments? <br />PAEDAGOGUS: No, no: before all else, let us seek to obey the command of <br /><a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Loxias</a>, and thence make a fair beginning, by pouring libations to thy sire; that brings victory within our grasp, and gives us the mastery in all that we do. <br />(Exeunt PAEDAGOGUS on the spectators' left, ORESTES and PYLADES: the right.- Enter ELECTRA, from the house. She is meanly clad.) <br />ELECTRA (chanting) <br />O thou pure sunlight, and thou air, earth's canopy, how often have ye heard the strains of my lament, the wild blows dealt against this bleeding breast, when dark night fails! And my wretched couch in yonder house of woe knows well, ere now, how I keep the watches of the night,- how often I bewail my hapless sire; to whom deadly <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> gave not of his gifts in a strange land, but my mother, and her mate <br /><a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>, cleft his head with murderous axe, as woodmen fell an oak. And for this no plaint bursts from any lip save mine, when thou, my father, hath died a death so cruel and so piteous! <br />But never will I cease from dirge and sore lament, while I look on the trembling rays of the bright stars, or on this light of day; but like the nightingale, slayer of her offspring, I will wail without ceasing, and cry aloud to all, here, at the doors of my father. <br />O home of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> and <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Persephone</a>! O <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> of the shades! potent <br />Curse, and ye, dread daughters of the gods, <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Erinyes</a>,- Ye who behold when a life is reft by violence, when a bed is dishonoured by stealth,- come, help me, avenge the murder of my sire,- and send to me my brother; for I have no more the strength to bear up alone against the load of grief that weighs me down. <br />(As ELECTRA finishes her lament, the CHORUS OF WOMEN OF MYCENAE enter. The following lines between ELECTRA and the CHORUS are chanted responsively.) </p>                        </div>

Perish the author of that deed, if I may utter such prayer! <br />ELECTRA: Ah, noble-hearted maidens, ye have come to soothe my woes. I: know and feel it, it escapes me not; but I cannot leave this task undone, or cease from mourning for my hapless sire.

Thou hast greatly aggravated thy troubles, ever breeding wars with thy sullen soul; but such strife should not be pushed to a conflict with the strong. <br />ELECTRA: I have been forced to it,- forced by dread causes; I know my own passion, it escapes me not; but, seeing that the causes are so dire, will never curb these frenzied plaints, while life is in me. Who indeed, ye kindly sisterhood, who that thinks aright, would deem that any word of solace could avail me? Forbear, forbear, my comforters! Such ills must be numbered with those which have no cure; I can never know a respite from my sorrows, or a limit to this wailing. <br />CHORUS: epode <br />At least it is in love, like a true-hearted mother, that I: dissuade thee from adding misery to miseries. <br />ELECTRA: But what measure is there in my wretchedness? Say, how can it be right to neglect the dead? Was that impiety ever born in mortal? Never may I have praise of such; never when my lot is cast in pleasant places, may I cling to selfish ease, or dishonour my sire by restraining the wings of shrill lamentation! <br />For if the hapless dead is to lie in dust and nothingness, while the slayers pay not with blood for blood, all regard for man, all fear of heaven, will vanish from the earth. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS: I came, my child, in zeal for thy welfare no less than for mine own; but if I speak not well, then be it as thou wilt; for we will follow thee. </p>                        </div>

How indeed could any woman of noble nature refrain, who saw the calamities of a father's house, as I see them by day and night continually, not fading, but in the summer of their strength? I, who, first, from the mother that bore me have found bitter enmity; next, in mine own home I dwell with my father's murderers; they rule over me, and with them it rests to give or to withhold what I need. <br />And then think what manner of days I pass, when I see <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> sitting on my father's throne, wearing the robes which he wore, and pouring libations at the hearth where he slew my sire; and when I: see the outrage that crowns all, the murderer in our father's bed at our wretched mother's side, if mother she should be called, who is his wife; but so hardened is she that she lives with that accursed one, fearing no <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Erinys</a>; nay, as if exulting in her deeds, having found the day on which she treacherously slew my father of old, she keeps it with dance and song, and month by month sacrifices <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> to the gods who have wrought her deliverance. <br />But I, hapless one, beholding it, weep and pine in the house, and bewail the unholy feast named after my sire,- weep to myself alone; since I may not even indulge my grief to the full measure of my yearning. For this woman, in professions so noble, loudly upbraids me with such taunts as these: 'Impious and hateful girl, hast thou alone lost a father, and is there no other mourner in the world? An evil doom be thine, and may the gods infernal give thee no riddance from thy present laments.' <br />Thus she insults; save when any one brings her word that <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> is coming: then, infuriated, she comes up to me, and cries;- 'Hast not thou brought this upon me? Is not this deed thine, who didst steal <br /><a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> from my hands, and privily convey him forth? Yet be sure that thou shalt have thy due reward.' So she shrieks; and, aiding her, the renowned spouse at her side is vehement in the same strain,- that abject dastard, that utter pest, who fights his battles with the help of women. But I, looking ever for <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> to come and end these woes, languish in my misery. Always intending to strike a blow, he has worn out every hope that I could conceive. In such a case, then, friends, there is no room for moderation or for reverence; in sooth, the stress of ills leaves no choice but to follow evil ways. <br />LEADER: Say, is <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> near while thou speakest thus, or absent from home? <br />ELECTRA: Absent, certainly; do not think that I should have come to the doors, if he had been near; but just now he is afield. <br />LEADER: Might I converse with thee more freely, if this is so? <br />ELECTRA: He is not here, so put thy question; what wouldst thou? </p>                        </div>

She is richly dressed.) <br />CHRYSOTHEMIS: Why, sister, hast thou come forth once more to declaim thus at the public doors? Why wilt thou not learn with any lapse of time to desist from vain indulgence of idle wrath? Yet this I know,- that I myself am- grieved at our plight; indeed, could I find the strength, I would show what love I bear them. But now, in these troubled waters, 'tis best, methinks, to shorten sail; I care not to seem active, without the power to hurt. And would that thine own conduct were the same! <br />Nevertheless, right is on the side of thy choice, not of that which <br />I advise; but if I am to live in freedom, our rulers must be obeyed in all things. <br />ELECTRA: Strange indeed, that thou, the daughter of such a sire as thine, shouldst forget him, and think only of thy mother! All thy admonitions to me have been taught by her; no word is thine own. Then take thy choice,- to be imprudent; or prudent, but forgetful of thy friends: thou, who hast just said that, couldst thou find the strength, thou wouldst show thy hatred of them; yet, when I am doing my utmost to avenge my sire, thou givest no aid, but seekest to turn thy sister from her deed. <br />Does not this crown our miseries with cowardice? For tell me,- <br />Or let me tell thee,- what I should gain by ceasing from these laments? Do not live?- miserably, I know, yet well enough for me. <br />And I vex them, thus rendering honour to the dead, if pleasure can be felt in that world. But thou, who tellest me of thy hatred, hatest in word alone, while in deeds thou art with the slayers of thy sire. I, then, would never yield to them, though I were promised the gifts which now make thee proud; thine be the richly-spread table and the life of luxury. For me, be it food enough that I do not wound mine own conscience; I covet not such privilege as thine,- nor wouldst thou, wert thou wise. But now, when thou mightest be called daughter of the noblest father among men, be called the child of thy mother; so shall thy baseness be most widely seen, in betrayal of thy dead sire and of thy kindred. </p>                        </div>

Wroth thereat, the daughter of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> detained the Greeks, that, in quittance for the wild creature's life, my father should yield up the life of his own child.

Often hast thou charged me with rearing him to punish thy crime; and I would have done so, if I could, thou mayst be sure:-for that matter, denounce me to all, as disloyal, if thou wilt, or petulant, or impudent; for if I am accomplished in such ways, methinks I am no unworthy child of thee. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS: I see that she breathes forth anger; but whether justice be with her, for this she seems to care no longer. <br />CLYTEMNESTRA (to the CHORUS) And what manner of care do I need to use against her, who hath thus insulted a mother, and this at her ripe age?

To speak briefly, where there is much to tell, I know not the man whose deeds and triumphs have matched his; but one thing thou must know; in all the contests that the judges announced, he bore away the prize; and men deemed him happy, as oft as the herald proclaimed him an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a>, by name <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, son of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, who once gathered the famous armament of Greece. <br />Thus far, 'twas well; but, when a god sends harm, not even the strong man can escape. For, on another day, when chariots were to try their speed at sunrise, he entered, with many charioteers.

All shouted to their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and shook the reins in their hands; the whole course was filled with the noise of rattling chariots; the dust flew upward; and all, in a confused throng, plied their goads unsparingly, each of them striving to pass the wheels and the snorting steeds of his rivals; for alike at their backs and at their rolling wheels the breath of the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> foamed and smote. <br /><a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a>, driving close to the pillar at either end of the course, almost grazed it with his wheel each time, and, giving rein to the trace-horse on the right, checked the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> on the inner side. <br />Hitherto, all the chariots had escaped overthrow; but presently the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404229PAin class=demonym long=22.8341 lat=40.4754>Aenian</a>'s hard-mouthed colts ran away, and, swerving, as they passed from the sixth into the seventh round, dashed their foreheads against the team of the Barcaean.

Team was brought level with team, and so they raced,-first one man, then the other. showing his head in front of the chariots. <br />Hitherto the ill-fated <a href=/people/120 target=_blank>Orestes</a> had passed safely through every round, steadfast in his steadfast car; at last, slackening his left rein while the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was turning, unawares he struck the edge of the pillar; he broke the axle-box in twain; he was thrown over the chariot-rail; he was caught in the shapely reins; and, as he fell on the ground, his colts were scattered into the middle of the course. <br />But when the people saw him fallen from the car, a cry of pity went up for the youth, who had done such deeds and was meeting such a doom,- now dashed to earth, now tossed feet uppermost to the sky,- till the charioteers, with difficulty checking the career of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, loosed him, so covered with blood that no friend who saw it would have known the hapless corpse. Straightway they burned it on a pyre; and chosen men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386227RPho class=place long=22.7 lat=38.6>Phocis</a> are bringing in a small urn of bronze the sad dust of that mighty form, to find due burial in his fatherland. <br />Such is my story,- grievous to hear, if words can grieve; but for us, who beheld, the greatest of sorrows that these eyes have seen. </p>                        </div>

As for the support of friends, thou thyself must know that we have none; <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> hath taken our friends away. and we two are left alone. I, so long as I heard that my brother still lived and prospered, had hopes that he would yet come to avenge the murder of our sire. But now that he is no more, I: look next to thee, not to flinch from aiding me thy sister to slay our father's murderer, <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a>:- I must have no secret from thee more. <br />How long art thou to wait inactive? What hope is left standing, to which thine eyes can turn? Thou hast to complain that thou art robbed of thy father's heritage; thou hast to mourn that thus far thy life is fading without nuptial song or wedded love. Nay, and do not hope that such joys will ever be thine; <a href=/people/374 target=_blank>Aegisthus</a> is not so ill-advised as ever to permit that children should spring from thee or me for his own sure destruction. But if thou wilt follow my counsels, first thou wilt win praise of piety from our dead sire below, and from our brother too; next, thou shalt be called free henceforth, as thou wert born, and shalt find worthy bridals; for noble natures draw the gaze of all. <br />Then seest thou not what fair fame thou wilt win for thyself and for me, by hearkening to my word? What citizen or stranger, when he sees us, will not greet us with praises such as these?- 'Behold these two sisters, my friends, who saved their father's house; who, when their foes were firmly planted of yore, took their lives in their hands and stood forth as avengers of blood! Worthy of love are these twain, worthy of reverence from all; at festivals, and wherever the folk are assembled, let these be honoured of all men for their prowess.' Thus will every one speak of us, so that in life and in death our glory shall not fail. <br />Come, dear sister, hearken! Work with thy sire, share the burden of thy brother, win rest from woes for me and for thyself,- mindful of this, that an ignoble life brings shame upon the noble. <br />LEADER OF THE CHORUS: In such case as this, forethought is helpful for those who speak and those who hear. <br />CHRYSOTHEMIS: Yea, and before she spake, my friends, were she blest with a sound mind, she would have remembered caution, as she doth not remember it. <br />Now whither canst thou have turned thine eyes, that thou art arming thyself with such rashness, and calling me to aid thee? Seest thou not, thou art a woman, not a man, and no match for thine adversaries in strength? And their fortune prospers day by day, while ours is ebbing and coming to nought. Who, then, plotting to vanquish a foe so strong, shall escape without suffering deadly scathe? See that we change not our evil plight to worse, if any one hears these words. It brings us no relief or benefit, if, after winning fair fame, we die an ignominious death; for mere death is not the bitterest, but rather when one who wants to die cannot obtain even that boon. <br />Nay, I beseech thee, before we are utterly destroyed, and leave our house desolate, restrain thy rage! I will take care that thy words remain secret and harmless; and learn thou the prudence, at last though late, of yielding, when so helpless, to thy rulers. <br />LEADER: Hearken; there is no better gain for mortals to win than foresight and a prudent mind. <br />ELECTRA: Thou hast said nothing unlooked-for; I well knew that thou wouldst reject what I proffered. Well! I must do this deed with mine own hand, and alone; for assuredly I will not leave it void. <br />CHRYSOTHEMIS: Alas! Would thou hadst been so purposed on the day of our father's death! What mightst thou not have wrought? <br />ELECTRA: My nature was the same then, but my mind less ripe. <br />CHRYSOTHEMIS: Strive to keep such a mind through all thy life. </p>                        </div>
