I am present, having left the secret dwellings of the dead and the gates of darkness, where <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> has his abode apart from the other Gods, <a href=/people/4274 target=_blank>Polydore</a> the son of <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a> the daughter of <a href=/people/2377 target=_blank>Cisseus</a>, and <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> my sire, who when the danger of falling by the spear of Greece was threatening the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, in fear, privately sent me from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> land to the house of <a href=/people/2688 target=_blank>Polymestor</a>, his Thracian friend, who cultivates the most fruitful soil of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>, ruling a warlike people with his spear.

But I was the youngest of the sons of <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>; on which account also he sent me privately from the land, for I was able neither to bear arms nor the spear with my youthful arm. As long then indeed as the landmarks of the country remained erect, and the towers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> were unshaken, and <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> my brother prevailed with his spear, I miserable increased vigorously as some young branch, by the nurture I received at the hands of the Thracian, my father's friend.

But I am exposed on the shore, at another time on the ocean's surge, borne about by many ebbings and flowings of the waves, unwept, unburied; but at present I am hastening on my dear mother's account, having left my body, borne aloft this day already the third, for so long has my wretched mother been present in this territory of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. </p>                        </div>

For it is said that it has been decreed in the full council of the Greeks to make thy daughter a sacrifice to <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>: for you know how that having ascended o'er his tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships, as they were setting their sails with their halliards, exclaiming in these words; Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored! Then the waves of great contention clashed together, and a divided opinion went forth through the army of the Greeks; to some it appeared advisable to give a victim to his tomb, and to others it appeared not. But <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> was studious to advance your good, cherishing the love of the infuriated prophetess. But the two sons of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, scions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, were the proposers of different arguments, but in this one opinion they coincided, to crown the tomb of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> with fresh blood; and declared they would never prefer the bed of <a href=/people/631 target=_blank>Cassandra</a> before the spear of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>. And the strength of the arguments urged on either side was in a manner equal, till that subtle adviser, that babbling knave, honeyed in speech, pleasing to the populace, that son of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>, persuades the army, not to reject the suit of the noblest of all the Greeks on account of a captive victim, and not to put it in the power of any of the dead standing near <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Proserpine</a> to say that the Grecians departed from the plains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> ungrateful to the heroes who died for the state of Greece. And <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> will come only not now, to tear your child from your bosom, and to take her from your aged arms. But go to the temples, speed to the altars, sit a suppliant at the knees of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, invoke the Gods, both those of heaven, and those under the earth; for either thy prayers will prevent thy being deprived of thy wretched daughter, or thou must behold the virgin falling before the tomb, dyed in blood gushing forth in a dark stream from her neck adorned with gold. </p>                        </div>

Thankless is your race, as many of you as court honor from oratory before the populace; be ye not known to me, who care not to injure your friends, provided you say what is gratifying to the people. But plotting what dark design have they determined upon a decree of death against my child? Did fate impel them to offer human sacrifices at the tomb, where it were rather right to sacrifice <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>? Or does <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a>, desirous of devoting in his turn to death those that wrought his death, with a color of justice meditate her destruction?

Thy hand and knees I in return grasp, and re-demand the favor I granted you then, and beseech you, do not tear my child from my arms, nor kill her; enough have died already. In her I rejoice, and forget my misfortunes; she serves as my consolation in the stead of many things, she is my city, my nurse, my staff, the guide of my way. It becomes not those who have power to exercise their power in things wherein they ought not, nor should the fortunate imagine their fortune will last forever. For I too have had my time of prosperity, but now have I ceased to be: one day wrenched from me all my happiness. But by thy beard which I supplicate, reverence me, pity me; go to the Grecian army, and remind them that it is a shameful thing to slay women whom ye have once spared, and that too dragging them from the altar. But show mercy. But the laws of blood among you are laid down alike for the free and the slave.

But as many as were mothers caressed my children in their arms in seeming admiration, that they might be farther removed from their father, successively handing them from one to another: and then, amidst their kind blandishments, what think you? in an instant, snatching from somewhere beneath their garments their daggers, they stab my children. But they having seized me in an hostile manner held my hands and feet; and if, wishing to succor my children, I raised my head, they held me by the hair: but if I attempted to move my hands, I wretched could effect nothing through the host of women. But at last, cruelty and worse than cruelty, they perpetrated dreadful things; for having taken their clasps they pierce and gore the wretched pupils of my eyes, then vanish in flight through the tent. But I, having leaped out, like some exasperated beast, pursue the blood-stained wretches, searching every wall, as the hunter, casting down, rending. This have I suffered, while studious to advance thy interest, <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, and having killed thine enemy. But that I may not extend my speech to a greater length, if any one of those of ancient times hath reviled women, or if any one doth now, or shall hereafter revile them, I will comprise the whole when I say, that such a race neither doth the sea nor the earth produce, but he who is always with them knows it best. <br />CHOR. Be not at all insolent, nor, in thy calamities, thus comprehending the female sex, abuse them all.

But if a man has acted well, well should he speak; if on the other hand basely, his words likewise should be unsound, and never ought he to be capable of speaking unjust things well. Perhaps indeed they who have brought these things to a pitch of accuracy are accounted wise, but they can not endure wise unto the end, but perish vilely, nor has any one yet escaped this. And this in my prelude is what I have to say to thee. Now am I going to direct my discourse to this man, and I will answer his arguments. Thou, that assertest, that in order to rid the Greeks of their redoubled toil, and for <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>'s sake that thou didst slay my son? But, in the first place, monstrous villain, never can the race of barbarians be friendly to the Grecians, never can this take place. But what favor wert thou so eagerly currying? wert thou about to contract an alliance, or was it that thou wert of kindred birth, or what pretext hadst thou? or were they about to ravage the crops of thy country, having sailed thither again? Whom, thinkest thou, wilt thou persuade of these things? The gold, if thou wert willing to speak truth, the gold destroyed my son, and thy base gains. For come, tell me this; how when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was prosperous, and a tower yet girt around the city, and <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> lived, and the spear of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> was in its glory, why didst thou not then, if thou wert willing to lay him under this obligation, bringing up my child, and retaining him in thy palace, why didst thou not then slay him, or go and take him alive to the Greeks? </p>                        </div>

Now hear besides how thou wilt appear vile: thou oughtest, if thou wert the friend of the Greeks, to have given the gold, which thou confessedst thou hast, not thine, but his, distributing to those who were in need, and had long been strangers to their native land. But thou, even now, hast not courage to part with it from thy hand, but having it, thou still art keeping it close in thine house. And yet, in bringing up my child, as it was thy duty to bring him up, and in preserving him, thou hadst had fair honor. For in adversity friends are most clearly proved good. But good circumstances have in every case their friends. But if thou wert in want of money, and he in a flourishing condition, my son had been to thee a vast treasure; but now, thou neither hast him for thy friend, and the benefit from the gold is gone, and thy sons are gone, and thou art — as thou art. But to thee, <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, I say; if thou aidest this man, thou wilt appear to be doing wrong. For thou wilt be conferring a benefit on a host, who is neither pious, nor faithful to those to whom he ought, not holy, not just.
