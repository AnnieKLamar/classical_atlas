As to 'foolishness,' that remains to be seen. Now, to begin with, you seem to be quite ignorant of the antiquity of the pantomimic art. It is not a new thing; it does not date from today or yesterday; not, that is to say, from our grandfathers' times, nor from their grandfathers' times. The best antiquarians, let me tell you, trace dancing back to the creation of the universe; it is coeval with that <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> who was the beginning of all things. In the dance of the heavenly bodies, in the complex involutions whereby the planets are brought into harmonious intercourse with the fixed stars, you have an example of that art in its infancy, which, by gradual development, by continual improvements and additions, seems at length to have reached its climax in the subtle harmonious versatility of modern Pantomime. </p>                        </div>

She was richly rewarded: for by their dancing they saved her child <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, who owes it to them (nor can he with decency deny it) that he escaped the paternal teeth. The dancing was performed in full armour; sword clashed against shield, and inspired heels beat martial time upon the ground. The art was presently taken up by the leading men in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, who by dint of practice became admirable dancers; and this applies not only to private persons, but to men of the first eminence, and of royal blood.

And in the middle of it all is the actor, shouting away, now high, now low, — chanting his iambics as often as not; could anything be more revolting than this sing-song recitation of tragic woes?

Then again, your objection to dancing — that men act women's parts — is equally applicable to tragedy and comedy, in which indeed there are more women than men. By comedy, the absurdity of the masks — of a Davus, for instance, or a <a href=/people/5284 target=_blank>Tibius</a>, or a cook — is actually claimed as one of its attractions. On the other hand, I need not tell you how decent, how seemly, is the dancer's attire; any one who is not blind can see that for himself. His very mask is elegant, and well adapted to his part; there is no gaping here; the lips are closed, for the dancer has plenty of other voices at his service.

And now, before I proceed further, I wish to offer an explanation of the many omissions I have made, which might otherwise be attributed to ignorance. I am well aware that the subject has already been dealt with by a number of writers, who have chiefly occupied themselves with a description of the various forms of dance, and a catalogue of their names, their characters, and their inventors; and this they regard as a proof of erudition. Such work I leave to the ambition of dullards and pedants, as foreign to my own purpose. I would have you observe, and bear in mind, that I do not propose to make a complete history of the art of dancing; nor is it my object to enumerate the names of dances, except so far as I have already done, in handling a few of the principal types: on the contrary, I am chiefly concerned with pointing out the profit and pleasure to be derived from modern Pantomime, which did not begin to take its present admirable form in ancient days, but only in the time of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, or thereabouts. In those earlier times we have but the beginnings of the art; the tree is taking root; the flower and the fruit have reached their perfection only in our own day, and it is with these that I have to do. The tongs-dance, the crane-dance, and others I pass over because they are alien to my subject; similarly, if I have said nothing of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> dance, — that riotous convivial fling, which was performed by energetic yokels to the piping of a flute-girl, and which still prevails in country districts, — I have omitted it not from ignorance, but because it has no connexion with the Pantomime of today. I have the authority of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, in his Laws, for approving some forms of dance and rejecting others; he there examines the dance from the two points of view of pleasure and utility, banishes those forms that are unseemly, and selects others for his recommendation. </p>                        </div>

To enlarge further upon its history would be pedantic. And now I come to the pantomime. What must be his qualifications? what his previous training? what his studies? what his subsidiary accomplishments? You will find that his is no easy profession, nor lightly to be undertaken; requiring as it does the highest standard of culture in all its branches, and involving a knowledge not of music only, but of rhythm and metre, and above all of your beloved philosophy, both natural and moral, the subtleties of dialectic alone being rejected as serving no useful purpose. Rhetoric, too, in so far as that art is concerned with the exposition of human character and human passions, claims a share of its attention. Nor can it dispense with the painter's and the sculptor's arts; in its close observance of the harmonious proportions that these teach, it is the equal of an <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> or a <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a>.

He had inveighed against Pantomime in just your own terms. The pantomime, he said, was a mere appendage to flute and pipe and beating feet; he added nothing to the action; his gesticulations were aimless nonsense; there was no meaning in them; people were hoodwinked by the silken robes and handsome mask, by the fluting and piping and the fine voices, which served to set off what in itself was nothing. The leading pantomime of the day — this was in <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>'s reign — was apparently a man of no mean intelligence; unsurpassed, in fact, in wideness of range and in grace of execution. Nothing, I think, could be more reasonable than the request he made of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, which was, to reserve his decision till he had witnessed his performance, which he undertook to go through without the assistance of flute or song. He was as good as his word. The time-beaters, the flutes, even the chorus, were ordered to preserve a strict silence; and the pantomime, left to his own resources, represented the loves of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> and <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, the tell-tale <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, the craft of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, his capture of the two lovers in the net, the surrounding Gods, each in his turn, the blushes of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, the embarrassment of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, his entreaties, — in fact the whole story. <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> was ravished at the spectacle; nor could there be higher praise than that with which he rewarded the performer.

I know not what truth there may be in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s analysis of the soul into the three elements of spirit, appetite, and reason: but each of the three is admirably illustrated by the pantomime; he shows us the angry man, he shows us the lover, and he shows us every passion under the control of reason; this last — like touch among the senses — is all-pervading. Again, in his care for beauty and grace of movement, have we not an illustration of the Aristotelian principle, which makes beauty a third part of Good? Nay, I once heard some one hazard a remark, to the effect that the philosophy of Pantomime went still further, and that in the silence of the characters a <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> doctrine was shadowed forth.

They are a most intelligent people, and devoted to Pantomime; each individual is all eyes and ears for the performance; not a word, not a gesture escapes them. Well, when a small man came on in the character of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, they cried out with one voice: 'Here is <a href=/people/1868 target=_blank>Astyanax</a>; and where is <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>?'

The well-meant activity of a fat and heavy dancer was met with earnest entreaties to 'spare the platform'; while a thin performer was recommended to 'take care of his health.' I mention these criticisms, not on account of their humorous character, but as an illustration of the profound interest that whole cities have sometimes taken in Pantomime, and of their ability to discern its merits and demerits. </p>                        </div>

Pantomimes cannot all be artists; there are plenty of ignorant performers, who bungle their work terribly. Some cannot adapt themselves to their music; they are literally 'out of tune'; rhythm says one thing, their feet another. Others are free from this fault, but jumble up their chronology. I remember the case of a man who was giving the birth of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a> eating his own children: seduced by the similarity of subject, he ran off into the tale of <a href=/people/126 target=_blank>Atreus</a> and <a href=/people/598 target=_blank>Thyestes</a>.

When every one of the spectators identifies himself with the scene enacted, when each sees in the pantomime as in a mirror the reflection of his own conduct and feelings, then, and not till then, is his success complete. But let him reach that point, and the enthusiasm of the spectators becomes uncontrollable, every man pouring out his whole soul in admiration of the portraiture that reveals him to himself.

I remember seeing this exemplified in the case of an actor of repute. In most respects a capable, nay, an admirable performer, some strange fatality ran him a-ground upon this reef of over-enthusiasm. He was acting the madness of <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, just after he has been worsted by <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>; and so lost control of himself, that one might have been excused for thinking his madness was something more than feigned. He tore the clothes from the back of one of the iron-shod time-beaters, snatched a flute from the player's hands, and brought it down in such trenchant sort upon the head of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a>, who was standing by enjoying his triumph, that, had not his cap held good, and borne the weight of the blow, poor <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> must have fallen a victim to histrionic frenzy. The whole house ran mad for company, leaping, yelling, tearing their clothes. For the illiterate riffraff, who knew not good from bad, and had no idea of decency, regarded it as a supreme piece of acting; and the more intelligent part of the audience, realizing how things stood, concealed their disgust, and instead of reproaching the actor's folly by silence, smothered it under their plaudits; they saw only too clearly that it was not <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> but the pantomime who was mad. Nor was our spirited friend content till he had distinguished himself yet further: descending from the stage, he seated himself in the senatorial benches between two consulars, who trembled lest he should take one of them for a ram and apply the lash. The spectators were divided between wonder and amusement; and some there were who suspected that his ultra-realism had culminated in reality. </p>                        </div>
