For if they save themselves by a stout defence against the foe, their enemies will be intimidated and disinclined to attack them in the future, but if they make a poor showing in the face of danger, no hope of safety will be left. 3 Those, therefore, who are to contend for all these precious stakes must fail in no preparation and no effort, but must take thought for many and varied activities, so that a failure may at least not seem due to their own fault. 4 But if after all a reverse should befall them, yet at all events the survivors may some time restore their affairs to their former condition, like certain Greek peoples who, after being reduced to extremes, have reestablished themselves. </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=ethnic long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataeans</a> concluded, therefore, that they could easily defeat them by an attack, and so promptly devised the following scheme. 4 Some of the authorities engaged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> in the market-place in a discussion of terms, while others were secretly passing the word around to the rest of the citizens not to go out of their houses singly, but one or two at a time to break through the party-walls and assemble stealthily in one another's houses. 5 When a sufficient fighting force was ready, they blocked up the streets and alleys, using wagons without the draft-animals, and rushing together at a given signal, fell upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a>. 6 At the same time the women-folk and the house-slaves were on the tile-roofs. The result was that when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> wished to act and to defend themselves in the darkness they suffered no less harm from the wagons than from their assailants, since they fled without knowing which way to turn for safety because of the barricades of wagons, while their pursuers, being acquainted with the ground, soon killed many of them. 7 Yet it is necessary to set forth also the reasons which make against this practice, such as the great danger to the besieged if there is only one open place and the conspirators are the first to seize it. For when there is only one such common spot, the advantage would lie with those who first take it. But if there are two or three such places, there would be these advantages: 8 If the conspirators should seize one or two there would still be one left for their opponents; and if they should seize them all, by separation and division they would be weaker in the face of their united opponents, unless indeed each division were numerically superior to the defenders of the city. In the same way in all other decisions one should consider the inherent objections to the prescribed rules, that one may not inadvisedly adopt another course. </p>                        </div>

Should the citizens, however, suspect one another, trustworthy men should be stationed at the several places for ascending the wall, who, if anyone else attempts to mount, will prevent him from doing so. 4 In peace, also, the citizens ought to be organized in the following manner. First of all one should appoint as captain of each precinct the most capable and prudent man, to whom the citizens are to rally if anything unexpected occurs at night. 5 The precinct captains should muster at the market-place the men of those precincts nearest the market-place, at the theatre the men of those precincts nearest the theatre, and so for the other open places the precinct captains with the armed men who have reported to them should gather, each in the one that lies nearest to him. 6 For this is the quickest way by which each group would both reach their stations and be near their own homes, and so, as heads of families, could communicate with their households, that is, with their children and wives, because stationed not far from them. And it should be determined beforehand by lot to which quarter each of the authorities should go and send detachments of troops to the battlements. Moreover, there will be leaders to look after everything else, provided that they thus assume immediate command. </p>                        </div>

For this is the sort of thing that has happened: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=place long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236WEur class=place long=23.591 lat=38.465>Euripus</a> was captured by a fugitive operating from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384238PEre class=place long=23.7905 lat=38.3982>Eretria</a>, aided by one of the inhabitants of the town who practised a stratagem of the following description. 2 To the most deserted part of the city, where the gate was regularly closed, he kept bringing a firepot, and by keeping the fire going day and night he secretly one night burned through the bar of the gate and admitted soldiers at that point. 3 When about two thousand men had gathered in the market-place, the alarm was hastily sounded and many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=ethnic long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcidians</a> were killed because they were not recognized, for in their panic they aligned themselves with their enemies as though they were their friends, each thinking that he was late in coming up. 4 In this way, then, most of them perished by ones and twos, and the city had been in the hands of the enemy for some time before the citizens knew what was happening. 5 It is necessary, then, in time of war, especially when the enemy is near at hand, first, that the forces which are being sent from the city on some enterprise by land or sea should be furnished with signals for use both by day and by night to those who remain, in order that the latter, if the enemy appear in the meantime, may not be unable to tell friend from foe. And, secondly, after their departure upon the enterprise, persons who will recognize the signals should be sent to watch, so that the men at home may get information of this kind while those returning are still a great way off. For it would be a great advantage to make preparations long beforehand for what is impending. 7 What has befallen those who did not take such precautions will be clear from some actual incidents which may be told in passing as illustration and definite evidence. 8 Word was brought to <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, when he was general at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> would come in ships, and attempt a night attack upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> women while they were celebrating at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> the festival of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>. On hearing this <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> set an ambush ahead of them, 9 and when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> disembarked, in secrecy as they supposed, and were some distance from the sea, he rose up and overcame those who had been trapped, killed most of them, and captured the ships in which they had come. 10 Then after quickly filling the ships with his own soldiers, he took from among the women those best fitted to make the voyage, and late in the day landed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> at some distance from the city. 11 Now many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, officials and others, when they caught sight of the ships sailing into the harbour, went out to meet them, wishing, no doubt, to see as many women as possible brought in as captives. Then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were ordered to attack the enemy, and disembarking with daggers in their hands to strike down some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, but to bring back to the ships as many as possible of the most prominent men; and this they did. 12 From what has been said, then, it is clear that for the conduct of musters and expeditions it is necessary to have prearranged signals, and those of a kind that cannot be misunderstood. </p>                        </div>

For whoever points out anyone conspiring against the city, or reports anyone as doing any of the things above-mentioned, a reward in money shall be announced, and the reward shall be displayed openly in the market-place or on an altar or in a temple, in order that men may the more readily venture to report any violation of the provisions mentioned. 16 Concerning a sovereign, a general, or a fugitive ruler one should make also the following proclamations: If the tyrannicide himself come to grief, the reward announced shall be paid to his children, and if he have none, to his next of kin. 17 And if anyone of the associates of the exile or sovereign or general do some service to the state, one half of the reward shall be paid him and a return to his home shall be granted, for because of these considerations he would the more readily make the attempt. 18 In a mercenary force, after a call for silence, the following shall be proclaimed in the hearing of all: 19 If anyone is displeased with the existing conditions, and wishes to withdraw, he may do so, but afterwards . . . he will be sold into slavery. For offences less than these imprisonment shall be the penalty, according to the existing law. If anyone be shown to be injuring the army or demoralizing the camp, death shall be the penalty. 20 Then attention shall be given to the other classes. First, one must note whether the citizens are of one mind, since that would be of greatest advantage during a siege. If not, one must, without arousing suspicion, remove the most influential of those out of sympathy with the existing order of things, especially those who might become leaders and responsible for action in the city, sending them away somewhere on a plausible pretext, as ambassadors or on other public business. 21 For instance, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> did this in the case of his brother <a href=/people/558 target=_blank>Leptines</a>, when he saw that he was popular with the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> and in many ways influential. Becoming suspicious of him and desiring to get rid of him, he did not openly attempt to expel him, for he knew that he would have great support and favour and that a revolution might ensue, so he devised this scheme. 22 He sent him with a few mercenaries to a city named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380138PHim class=place long=13.8225 lat=37.9708>Himera</a>, directing him to bring back part of its garrison and reorganize the rest. When he arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380138PHim class=place long=13.8225 lat=37.9708>Himera</a>, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> sent him word to stay there until he sent for him. 23 When a city has given hostages and a campaign is made against it, the parents and next of kin of the hostages should depart from the place until the siege is over, in order that they may not, in the assaults by the enemy, see their own sons brought forward and meeting a cruel end. For it is possible that these people, if they were in the city, might go so far as to engage in some act of opposition. 24 If, however, it prove difficult to send such persons out on these pretexts, they must continue in the city but share in only the fewest possible works and undertakings, and they must not know in advance where they are to be or what they are to do, being as little as possible their own masters by night and day. And on one duty and special service after another, without raising suspicion, many persons should keep coming and going about them, in whose company they will be under guard rather than on guard. 25 But let them be divided, so that they may be kept under watch, for in this manner they would be least able to begin a revolution. Again, citizens are not to go to bed with lamps or any light at night, for in some instances persons who have been thwarted in every way from beginning a revolution (which was what they wished), and from entering into negotiations with the enemy, have contrived thus: 26 carrying lights to their positions on guard-duty, along with their baskets and bedding — sometimes taking torches, sometimes lamps — ostensibly in order to have some light to go to bed by, they have by these lights given a prearranged signal.

Accordingly, one must always keep an eye on those who are too eager to effect matters of this kind. 6 At the same time he fastened to the wall and hung out, as if for drying, deer nets and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a> nets, and in other places sails with the ropes dangling, and it was by these that the soldiers climbed up at night. 7 Against revolutionists the following plan was carried out in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. When the rich men's party was about to launch the second attack against the people and was bringing up mercenaries, the leader of the people's party, who had found out what was about to happen, just before the attack won over two men of the party hostile to the people, to be his secret accomplices, and while publicly treating them as his enemies and abusing them he heard from them in private the plans of the opposing party. 8 Then, when the rich men were in the act of bringing in their mercenaries, and others of their party were at the same time ready within the city, and the deed was to take place the next night, he decided to call an immediate assembly of the people, without announcing what was to come, that the city might not be thrown into utter confusion, and told them, among other things, that it was desirable for all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> to stand at arms during the coming night, each man with his own tribe. 9 Further, that if anyone should follow a different course in arming himself or should appear elsewhere and out of his proper station, he should be punished as a traitor and conspirator against the people. 10 The purpose of this was that the rich men, scattered among the various tribes, should not be able to assemble at one point and attack with the mercenaries, but should be distributed in the several tribes as a small minority among their fellow-tribesmen. And he seems to have dealt skilfully, cleverly, and safely with the impending danger. 10a Similarly, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413314PHer class=place long=31.426 lat=41.287>Heracleia Pontica</a>, when the democracy was in power and the rich were conspiring against it and about to make an attack, the leaders of the popular party, who knew what was imminent, persuaded the people to establish a division into sixty 'hundreds' in place of their former three tribes and four 'hundreds,' so that, in the new divisions, the rich should do both guard duty and the other services. 11 The result was that here, too, the rich were scattered, and were, in each 'hundred,' few among many of the popular party. And a similar thing took place long ago in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a>. When the authorities were informed of a conspiracy to attack at the moment when the felt cap was raised, they thwarted those who planned the attack by giving the men who were about to raise the felt cap the order not to raise it. 13 In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a> a rebellion of the wealthy oligarchic party against the rule of the people (the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Chares</a>, who at that time lived there and commanded the guard, helped in this rebellion) was contrived in the following manner. 14 Some of the captains of the guard drew blood from themselves with cupping-glasses, and made cuts on their bodies and ran out bleeding into the market-place, as though they had been wounded. At the same time the other soldiers, who had been prepared for this, speedily took up their arms, and with them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=ethnic long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyreans</a> who were in the conspiracy; </p>                        </div>

This must be done in order that the divisions may be close together on the march, and, if it is necessary for one division to assist another, or for all to act together, they may easily be united and those in the rear may not have to come from a distance on the run. 5 The available cavalry and light-armed troops, however, also in good order, should go ahead of the others and should reconnoitre and preoccupy the elevated positions, that the heavy-armed troops may be aware as early as possible of the movements of the enemy and may not be surprised by any sudden attack. 6 At places where there are turning-points, bases of the ridges, and forks in the roads, that is, wherever there are diverging ways, signs should be placed, lest at these points the stragglers, through ignorance of the road, be separated from their fellows.

Meanwhile a part of these invaders separate and devastate the country, while others would lie in ambush expecting some of your forces to come in disorder to lend assistance. 5 It is not best, therefore, to disturb them by an immediate attack, but to allow them first to become bold, and in their contempt of you to start off pillaging and satisfying their greed. At the same time these men when sated with food and drink and heavy with wine would become careless and disobedient to their leaders; 6 and as a result of this they will be likely to put up a poor fight, and will retreat, at least if you fall upon them opportunely. 7 For, when your supporting force is ready at the appointed place, and the enemy has already scattered for plunder, then and then only you should attack them, cut off their retreat with your cavalry, set ambuscades of picked men, and, engaging them with your other light-armed forces, bring up your heavy-armed troops in close formation not far behind the divisions already sent forward. Attack the enemy where you are not unwilling to do battle, and where you will not be at a disadvantage in the fight. 8 Hence, for the reasons already stated, it is sometimes to your interest to give the enemy rein, and to allow him to lay waste as much of the land as he wishes, where, while plundering and laden with spoil, he will easily suffer punishment at your hands. For in this way all that has been taken would be recovered, and those who had done the damage would receive their just deserts. 9 On the other hand, if you should hastily send out relief forces, you might endanger your own men, unprepared and not yet in order, while the enemy, although they would already have done a little harm, yet, because they were still in order, would get away unpunished. 10 But it is much better, as I have written, to give way to them, and then attack them when off their guard. 11 But if the plundering of the country has escaped your notice or has occurred before you could prevent it, you should not make your pursuit of the enemy along the same roads nor in the same places, but should cause only a few to make a demonstration there, and, in their pursuit, intentionally but without arousing suspicion, refrain from overtaking them, while the army as a whole, in considerable strength, should hasten as quickly as possible by other roads, and, anticipating the enemy, should lie in ambush in the land of the invaders, near the border. 12 You may reasonably expect to reach their land first, since because of driving their booty they must advance more slowly. And you should make your attack upon them while they are at the evening meal; for when the marauders are already within their own border and feel themselves secure they would be inclined to carelessness and be more off their guard. 13 The best plan of all, however, in order to have your soldiers fresh for battle, provided boats are at hand, is to make the pursuit by sea; for you will thus outstrip the enemy, and the other conditions necessary for success will favour you, provided you are not detected by them on your voyage. 14 Of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325209UBar class=place long=20.8928 lat=32.4983>Barca</a> and certain other cities the story runs that they made their rescue expeditions over long wagon-roads in four- and in two <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> vehicles; and when they had reached the appointed place, and the vehicles had been arranged in order, the heavy-armed troops alighted, and, forming at once in ranks, attacked the enemy with unimpaired strength. </p>                        </div>

And then if the enemy break into the country and make for the city, you must begin the fighting, setting out from these places. 19 You must always, in making your attacks upon the enemy strive to profit from your acquaintance with the terrain; for you will have a great advantage from previous knowledge of the country and by leading the enemy into such places as you may wish, which are known to you and suitable, whether for defence, or pursuit, or flight, or withdrawal into the city either secretly or openly. Moreover, you will also know in advance what part of the country will supply you with provisions, whereas the enemy will be unacquainted, ignorant, and embarrassed in all these particulars. 20 The enemy, moreover, knowing that if one is unfamiliar with the country, not only is he unable to accomplish anything that he wishes, but it is also difficult for him to get away in safety, at least if the inhabitants wish to attack him, would come to grief from their spiritless and timid disposition towards everything, because they are unable to conjecture anything of the sort. For there would be as great a difference between the two parties as if it were the lot of the one to fight by night and the other by day, if this could in any way happen at the same time. 21 If you have a naval force the ships must be manned, for the marines will annoy the enemy as much as the infantry if your fleet sails by the coasts and the roads along the shore, so that the enemy will be embarrassed both by you and by the men from the ships who disembark in their rear. 22 By your doing so the enemy would be most unprepared for your attack, and they would be surprised by the outcome of your manoeuvre. </p>                        </div>

A public festival of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> took place outside the city, and the citizens formed an armed procession of men of military age. Meanwhile many conspirators who got ready, equipped themselves with arms, joined the procession, 3 and when it came to the temple and the altar the majority set down their weapons at a distance from the temple and went to pray at the altar. Of the conspirators, however, some remained with their arms, and others took their stand beside the magistrates and leading men of the city while they were at prayer, each beside his man, with dagger in hand. 4 These men some of the conspirators struck down, while others with their arms hastened into the city, and still others of the conspirators, who had remained in the town with the hoplites who had been previously collected, captured those quarters which were necessary for their purpose, and so admitted only those whom they wished.

Some one during the day has poured sand into the bolt-socket of the gate, so that the bolt may stick outside and not drop into the hole. They say, too, that bolt-pins already dropped into place have been extracted in the following manner. 4 While sand was poured into the socket a few grains at a time, the bolt pin was shaken noiselessly so that no one would notice it. Accordingly, as the sand worked down, the bolt pin came to the top, so that it was easily taken out. 5 It has happened that a keeper of the gate, on receiving from the general the bolt pin to put in place, with a chisel or file surreptitiously made a groove in the pin, looped a linen thread about it, and inserted it, and then after a little drew it out by the thread. 6 Yet another prepared a net of fine meshes to which was attached a linen thread, put the pin in that, and afterwards drew it out. The bolt pin has also been removed by driving it up out of the socket with blows from beneath. Again, it has been removed by means of delicate pincers; and for this one part of the pincers must be grooved, the other flat, so as to get an under-hold on the bolt pin with the grooved part and an over-hold with the other. 7 And still another, just as he was to drop the bolt pin in place, secretly turned the bar in order that the pin might not fall into the hole and that afterwards the gate might be forced open. 8 In the city of . . . near the border of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a> certain men who were endeavouring to smuggle in mercenaries began by getting the dimensions of the bolt pin in the following manner. 9 During the day they let down into the socket a loop of fine and strong linen thread, the ends of which were outside but not in sight, and when at night the bolt pin was put in place, with the ends of the thread they pulled up the loop and the pin, took its dimensions, and replaced it. Next they made a pin hook to fit the dimensions of the pin thus taken, in the following manner. 10 They had a tube made and a needle for sewing rush-mats. Now the tube was made in the usual fashion, but the mat needle had the point and the longer end made like other such needles, while the head was hollow like that of a spike at the butt of a spear into which the shaft is fitted; 11 and at the blacksmith's shop a shaft was fitted into it, but when they took it home this was removed, so that the head fitted the bolt pin when they were put together. Now that seems a very shrewd device to prevent the blacksmith from suspecting the purpose for which the tube and the mat needle were made and the fittings devised. 12 Some other men once, while the bolt pin was in the socket, got its measurements in the following manner. They wrapped a lump of potter's clay in a fine linen cloth and let it down into the socket, pressing the clay about the bolt pin with a tool: then they drew up the clay, took a cast of the pin, and made the key to fit. 13 The great city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382268PTeo class=place long=26.7877 lat=38.1717>Teos</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a> once came very near falling into the hands of <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=person long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> through the treachery of the gate-keeper. Among other things they agreed upon a dark, moonless night, on which one was to open the gate and the other to enter with mercenaries. 14 Now when the plan was to be put into execution the following night, a man came up to the gate-keeper late in the evening, when the guards were stationed on the wall and the gates were about to be locked, as it was already dark, and then disappeared, after first making fast the end of a ball of twisted linen cord, which was not likely to be easily broken. He went away, unrolling the ball as he went, until he reached a spot five stadia from the city, where the troops which were to enter would come. 16 Then, when the general came to lock the gates, and as usual gave the gate-keeper the bolt pin to put in place, the latter took it, and with a file or a chisel, noiselessly and without attracting attention, cut a groove in it so that a thread would catch it. He then slipped a loop over the pin and let it down with the thread attached to it. After that he shook the bar, showing the general that the gate was locked, and held his peace. 17 Some time after he drew up the pin and tied the end of the cord to himself, so that if he should happen to fall asleep he would be awakened by a pull at the cord. 18 Now <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a>, provided with the forces which were to enter with him, came near to a place agreed upon with the man who had the ball of cord. And a previous arrangement had been made with the gate-keeper that <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> was to pull the cord when he reached the spot, and if the keeper had things ready as he wished, he was to tie a flock of wool to the end of the cord and let it go, and, when <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> saw that, he was to hurry to the gate. 19 But in case of failure to secure what he wished he was to let the cord go without anything tied to it. Accordingly he let the cord go without anything tied to it, so that <a href=/people/785 target=_blank>Temenus</a> with a long start got away without being discovered. They found out accordingly in the night that the cord was . . . so because the situation was unfavourable in the city it was impossible to proceed. </p>                        </div>

And in short watches sleep would be less likely to steal upon the guards. Moreover, with many men on guard at once, some rumour of what is being done would be more likely to leak out. 5a It is better for as many as possible to be on watch in time of peril, and for all to do guard-duty during the night, so that as many as possible may be keeping guard at each watch. 6 But if few are on guard, and for long watches, sleep would steal upon them because of the length of the watches, and if any men should attempt a revolution, the length of the time of duty would favour them both in getting a start and in escaping detection in any dealings with the enemy. Such considerations, then, ought not to be ignored; 7 but in times of peril one must keep still other things in mind. Thus, no one of the guards should have any previous knowledge either of the number on his watch, or where in the city he is to be on guard. Nor should the same officers always command the same men; but as frequently as possible all the regulations concerning the watching of the citizens should be changed, for thus would a traitor been least able to betray anything to outsiders, or to receive anything from the enemy, 8 not knowing beforehand on what part of the wall he would be in the night, nor with whom, but being ignorant of what was to occur. And those who guard by day should not be employed at night, for it is not fitting that they should know beforehand what each is to do. 9 Guards from the stations on the wall should keep watch as follows. From each of the stations, at each change of the watch, one of the guards should go to the nearest station, and from this another to the next, and from the other stations still others to the remaining ones. Let everyone be ordered to do this at given signals. 10 In this way many will make their way around the walls at the same time, and each will move but a short distance, and the same men will not often remain together, since different guards will be constantly coming in contact with one another. If this be done no act of treachery could be performed by the guards. 11 The guards should stand facing one another, for in this way they can see in all directions and they will rarely be caught by any foe coming secretly against them, a thing that I have noted as having actually happened today watches. 12 During the dark winter nights stone after stone should be thrown over the walls, and, as if persons were seen, let the guard ask, Who goes there?, for any who might be approaching would thus be recognized without more ado. 13 If it should seem best, this could be done also inside the city. Some, however, this is dangerous, for a party of the enemy which might be approaching in the darkness are made aware in advance that they must not attack at this point, by the noise of the patrols and the throwing of stones, but rather at the point where there is no noise. 14 The best plan, however, on such nights is to have <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> tied outside the wall to keep watch. For they will detect at a greater distance the presence of a hostile spy, a deserter who is stealthily approaching the city, or one who is somewhere making his way out to desert; they will also by their barking rouse the sentinel if he happens to be asleep. 15 If any part of the city is easily accessible and exposed to the attacks of the enemy, the sentinels stationed there should be the wealthiest and most highly respected citizens and those who hold the most important offices in the city. For it would be in the highest degree to the interest of such men not to turn aside to pleasures, but rather, bearing in mind their position, to maintain a vigorous watch. 16 At the time of the public festivals those of the city guards who are greatly suspected and distrusted by their own comrades should be sent away from their posts to celebrate the festival at home. 17 For they will think that they are being honoured and at the same time would have no opportunity to carry out any plot. And in their places more trustworthy men should be assigned to guard duty; for during the festivals and on such occasions revolutionists are extremely likely to venture on some enterprise. An account of the disturbances which have arisen on such occasions has been given elsewhere. 19 It is better, moreover, that the ramps leading to the top of the wall should not be open, but rather be kept closed, thus rendering it impossible for anyone desirous of betraying the city to the enemy to seize part of the wall in advance, and that the sentinels, men of your choice, may be obliged to remain constantly on the wall and not come down. Then if any enemy, attacking the city from the outside, should succeed in scaling the wall by surprise, they could not easily and quickly descend from the wall into the city, unless they were willing to take the risk of leaping down from high places and to forgo the advantages of surprise and initiative. This method of guarding the ramps would be suitable also for the citadel of a prince. </p>                        </div>

If, however, one should go out on some necessary errand, he should take a lantern with him in order to be visible to the patrols at a distance. 24 Moreover, no workman or artisan should work at his trade lest noises made by any persons reach the sentinels. A plan by which the watches may be apportioned fairly and equally to all the sentinels, according as the nights become longer or shorter has been explained . . ., where it was stated that the watches should be measured by the water-clock, and this should be reset every ten days. 25 But a better plan is to smear the interior of the clock with wax and then to remove some of the wax when the nights grow longer, so that the clock may contain more water. When, on the other hand, the nights grow shorter, more wax should be added in order that the clock's capacity may be less. Let this, then, be sufficient explanation about the equalization of the watches. 26 At times of less imminent peril half the men enrolled in the army should be detailed for guard or patrol duty, and in this way half the army will be on guard every night. In times of peace and security the smallest possible number of the troops should be subjected to inconvenience, and to as little as possible. 27 And if the commander needs some patrol-work, a marked baton should be handed by him to the first sentinel; he in turn must pass it on to the next man, and one to another, until it has made the round of the city and has been returned to the commander. And previous instructions should have been given to the watchmen not to carry the baton beyond the position of the next man. 28 If, however, a sentinel, on his arrival at post, should find it deserted, he should return the baton to the man from whom he received it, so that the commander may be aware and may investigate which of the sentinels has failed to take the baton and has deserted his post. 29 Whenever a man who has a turn at the watch does not report for duty, his company-commander should at once sell his position for whatever it may bring, and should put another man on guard to take his place. Then the contractor of mercenaries, the same day, should pay the money to the man who has purchased the post, and on the following day the taxiarch should impose on the contractor the customary fine. </p>                        </div>

Then, watching the favourable moment, they sallied forth and attacked the enemy unexpectedly. But while they were doing all this they took good care to prevent any desertions. Accordingly, one must overlook none of these considerations. 6 Nor again should a leader inconsiderately go out at night with a crowd, because at such times some of the conspirators are forming plots, some within, some without the city, wishing to lure one out with deceptions such as beacon-torches, setting fire to a dockyard, or a gymnasium, or a public temple, or some building on account of which a crowd of men — and influential men too — might rush out. A leader should, therefore, use foresight, and not readily accept at their face value even such incidents. 7 I shall relate also the following sharp practice on the part of officials. It was arranged that a disturbance should arise in the country, and that word should be brought from the fields to the city of a robbers' plot, of the very kind at which the citizens were sure to hurry to the rescue. 8 And when this occurred, the magistrates and their supporters summoned the citizens to the rescue, and when the full number of the townsmen was gathered at the gates under arms, they contrived as follows. 9 The magistrates told the crowd that they must divide into three parts and lay an ambush a little distance from the city, and explained what they must do, the hearers having no suspicion of the truth. 10 They then led the people forth and stationed them in suitable places as though to ambush the invading enemy, while they themselves, taking troops who were accomplices in the matter, went ahead as though to inquire into the report and meet the danger first, ostensibly in order to entice the enemy into the ambuscades by pretending to flee. 11 But going to a place where they had a mercenary force, previously arranged and secretly brought in by sea, they picked them up before anyone knew of it, and secretly entered the city by other roads, as though returning with the citizens who had gone out for the attack. Then, with the mercenary force, they occupied the city, and of those in the ambuscades they banished some and admitted others. Accordingly, one must be suspicious of such acts and not inconsiderately make a sally in force at night against an enemy. </p>                        </div>

Then he entered in person with all his forces. 9 At the same time he carried out such a scheme as this, also: He laid an ambush with a part of his army, foreseeing that aid would come to the place, as actually happened.

So it is important to issue watchwords easily remembered and as nearly related as possible to the intended operations. 15 For instance, when going for game, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> the Huntress; for some stealthy enterprise, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> the Trickster; for some deed of violence, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>; for open undertakings, <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and Moon; and others as similar as possible to these and quite comprehensible to all. 16 <a href=/people/210 target=_blank>Iphicrates</a> would not allow the same watchword to be issued to the patrol and the guard, but employed a different word for each, that the one first questioned might reply, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, if he happened to have this one, and the other <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>. For in this manner they would be least likely to be deceived by the enemy, and the watchword to be betrayed. 17 If the guards become separated from one another they should give a whistle agreed upon beforehand to call one another. For, except to the man who already knows it, this signal will be unfamiliar, as well to Greeks as to barbarians. 18 One should watch the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> lest on account of the whistling there be some trouble from them. This method was used at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Cadmea</a> was captured: the forces were scattered in the darkness and unable to recognize one another, but were collected by whistling. 19 The watchwords should be asked by the men on patrol and the advanced pickets, each from the other, for there is no propriety in having only the one opened the asking, since in the guise of a patrol even an enemy might do that. </p>                        </div>

But if they have a light it must not shine upward (for it must be covered with something), but merely upon the ground and in front of their feet. 4 In a town in which <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> can be kept and on ground passable for them patrolling can be done in winter by horsemen, for in the cold and mud and long nights the patrolling would thus be more quickly accomplished. 5 And if together with these some men also patrol upon the walls they should be so placed that some may watch the outside of the wall and some the inside. 6 They should also on dark nights as they make their rounds have stones and throw them now and then outside the wall. Some, however, do not approve this custom for the reasons already mentioned. 7 In case they are suspicious of one another . . . the patrolling should be done at the base of the wall and no patrol except the watchmen should go up on the wall. Now if an army has suffered in morale because of defeat in battle, or from the size of their losses in dead and wounded, or from desertion by allies, or through any other misfortune it loses heart and has become discouraged, and if there is danger because of the nearness of the enemy, the directions already given out in regard to the watchmen are to be carried out. 8 At such times frequent rounds are necessary, but the patrol must not be too eager on his rounds to find members of the outposts in a rather careless condition from sleep or weariness. For it is not expedient to make the army, when in this state, still more disheartened — and a man is naturally discouraged if he is found behaving basely — but rather to turn one's attention to the care and recovery of one's troops. 9 And at such times the approach of the patrols should be evident to the guards from a long way off by their uttering some sound from a distance, so that the guard may be wakened if he is sleeping, and may be prepared to answer whatever is asked. It is best of all at such times for the general himself carefully to make each circuit with the same picked men. But when the army is in the opposite mood it is well to inspect the guards much more energetically. 11 The general must never make his round at a fixed hour, but must constantly shift it, lest the soldiers, knowing definitely long beforehand the coming of the general, may watch with especial care during that time. 12 At the advice and bidding of certain persons, however, some men adopt the following plan. If the commander of the city, on account of some weariness or ill health, does not wish to go on patrols, yet desires to know who, in each watch, fails to keep guard, he should act as follows. 13 Let it be previously arranged that all the watchmen at the wall shall be supplied with lanterns, and that there shall be a particular one at the appearance of which all the watchmen shall raise theirs. This one should be raised from a place at which all the watchmen on the wall will see it, 14 but if there be no such place ready, let one be built somehow, as high as possible. Then from the top of this let a lantern be raised and at its appearance let the others be raised, one by one, from each several post. Then they should be counted, and thus it may be known whether all the watchmen have raised them, or if any one of the guards is missing. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, against these some who wish to stop them advise that signals be appointed in advance for all the inhabitants of the town, which they will see and recognize, and in the following way they will know that there is a panic, namely, by noticing a previously arranged signal-fire at a place as conspicuous as may be to all those in the city. 3 And it is best to announce beforehand that, wherever panic occurs among the soldiers, they should stand in their places and shout 'Paean,' or say that it is a mere panic, and that every one who hears it should pass the word along to his neighbour. 4 Now wherever in the army they do not answer the paean, it will be known that there the terror prevails. But if the commander sees any reason for fear, he must give warning by the trumpet, and this is to be understood as a call to arms. It is after a defeat in battle that such fears are most likely to arise, sometimes by day but especially at night. 5 But that this may be less likely to happen, orders for the night should be given to all the soldiers to keep under arms as much as possible, as though something might happen where they are. 6 Thus, if they are forewarned, it is not likely that, in case anything happens, they will be taken by surprise on colliding with the enemy, or that they will be disturbed because of sudden terror and perish. 7 <a href=/people/7669 target=_blank>Euphratas</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconian</a> governor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>, since panics occurred in his army frequently at night and could not be quieted in any other way, used to give orders of this sort for the night: 8 that if any confusion should arise, his men should immediately sit up in their beds with their arms in hand, but that no one should stand upright, and if anyone saw a man standing up, <a href=/people/7669 target=_blank>Euphratas</a> gave orders in the hearing of all to treat him as an enemy. For he thought that through the fear which this command would inspire none would forget it. Moreover, that the command should actually inspire fear, on one occasion when a panic arose, one of the more respectable soldiers was wounded, though not mortally, while one of the baser sort was fatally injured. As a result of this, the men obeyed and, paying close attention, refrained from panics and from rising from their beds in terror. 11 And panics have been stopped in this way also: when confusion arose in camp at night, the herald commanded silence and announced that the man who reported the one who had turned loose the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> which had caused the commotion would receive a present of silver. 12 It is necessary, too, if an army has this sort of experience by night, to station men in each watch of the night over every company or band, both on the flanks and in the centre, to take special care that, if they should perceive any disturbance coming on because of sleep or anything else, whoever of them is at hand may check it immediately. 13 And of the rest of the troops, there should stand on guard one man from each mess, so that if any fear should arise, they, knowing what fears are groundless, may each calm the men at his own post. 14 But the commander should himself throw the army of the enemy into confusion at night by driving into their camp a herd of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a> wearing bells, or other animals, having first made them drunk with wine. <br />15 Reveille: At daybreak one must not permit the guards to leave their posts at once until the neighbourhood has been carefully reconnoitred and shown to be clear of the enemy. Even then they must not all leave their posts at once, but in detachments, so that some shall always continue on guard. </p>                        </div>

Close the other gates but leave one open where access to the city is most difficult, and where those who approach are going to be in plain sight for the longest distance. 2 In this there should be a wicket gate so that through it men may go and come singly, for in this way a deserter or spy would be least able to escape notice if he should enter, that is, if the gate-keeper is discreet. 3 But it is unsafe to open the entire gate for beasts of burden, wagons, and loads. And if there be any need of importing quickly food or oil or wine or similar supplies, either by wagons or by a squad of men, these should be brought in by the nearest gates, . . . as that would be quickest and easiest. 4 In general, the gates must not be opened incautiously early in the day, but later, and no one should be let out until the region around the city has been reconnoitred. Again, boats are not to be moored at the gates, but at a distance, since in time past, even in the daytime, when both gates have been open at once, many things have happened by tricks and pretexts such as the following — and from a single occurrence many cases similar to it will be understood. <br /><a href=/people/1639 target=_blank>Pytho</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=person long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a>, having also some confederates in the city, watched carefully for the most quiet hour of the day, and captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384268PKla class=place long=26.7703 lat=38.3614>Clazomenae</a> by means of wagons, which, in accordance with his plan, were bringing in wine-jars. While the wagons were stopping in the gates (for there were mercenaries ready in concealment not far from the city near the gates), his men, eluding some of the citizens and outstripping the others, with the aid of some persons inside got possession of the city. 6 And <a href=/people/5719 target=_blank>Iphiades</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=person long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydus</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, in his capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404271UPar class=place long=27.0671 lat=40.4257>Parium</a>, among other preparations for scaling the wall by night, secretly prepared wagons filled with brush and brambles and sent them to the wall (the gates being already closed), as though they were wagons of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371252PPar class=ethnic long=25.1483 lat=37.0844>Parians</a>, which after their arrival were parked near the gates from fear of the enemy. 7 At a suitable moment they were to set fire to the wagons, so that the gates might catch fire, and when the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404271UPar class=place long=27.0671 lat=40.4257>Parium</a> had gone to put out the flames he himself might enter at another point.

I shall relate likewise, as illustration, some things that have actually happened. 3 A city was captured, with the complicity of some within it, upon a public holiday, in some such manner as this. 4 First of all, to the aliens who had established themselves there in anticipation of what was to take place, and to the unarmed citizens who were to be accomplices there were brought in linen corslets, cloaks, helmets, shields, greaves, short swords, bows, arrows, stowed away in chests like those of merchants, with the statement that clothing and other merchandise were in them. 5 The revenue officers, opening these, and seeing what they thought was only clothing, affixed their seals until the importers should put a value upon them. 6 These cases were then stored in a convenient spot near the market-place. In crates also and wicker frames and wrapped up in half-woven sail-cloth, spears and javelins were brought in, and, without arousing suspicion, placed where each would be serviceable. And in baskets of chaff and of wool, bucklers and small shields were concealed in the wool and chaff; and others still smaller in baskets full of raisins and figs, as well as daggers concealed in jars of wheat and dried figs and olives. 7 And daggers were likewise carried in unsheathed in ripe gourds, pushed down along the stems among the seeds of the gourd. Likewise the deviser and leader of the plot was carried in from without hidden in a load of faggots. 8 And when night was come, and those who were to make the attack were assembled, and each one was looking out for the opportune time, at which all the rest of the citizens were completely intoxicated (as would be likely on a festival day), first of all the load was loosened and out of it came the leader ready prepared. Then some of them unrolled the crates to seize the spears and javelins, others emptied the baskets of chaff and wool, others cut open the hampers, others, opening the chests, took out the arms, and still others smashed the jars so as to lay hands upon the daggers as quickly as possible. 9 All these things took place at the same time and not far away from each other, at a signal given in the city as if for battle array. And when each one had equipped himself with arms suited to him, some of them rushed to seize the towers and the gates, through which they admitted the rest also; others fell upon the city-hall and the houses opposite; some took one place and some another. 11 In an enterprise similar to the kind already described, certain persons were without shields, and when in no other manner were they able to provide or import them, they brought in quantities of osiers and also workmen to handle them. 12 And by day they wove other kinds of basketry, but by night they wove armour, such as helmets and shields, to which they attached leathern and wooden handles. Furthermore, it is necessary to be watchful not only of vessels which come in by sea to anchor near by, night or day, whether great or small, but also it is necessary for the inspectors of the port and the supervisors to go on board and personally to see the wares, having in mind that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyonians</a> also, forgetting such precautions, suffered a serious disaster. </p>                        </div>

Especially secret messages might take the following forms. In one case a message was sent in this way: 2 in with merchandise or other baggage there was inserted a book, or some other chance document, of any size or age, and in this the message had been written by marking the letters of the first, second, or third line with dots, very small and discernible only to the recipient. Then, when the person intended received the book, he made a transcript, and by setting down in order the marked letters from the first line and the second and the others in the same way he discovered the message. 3 But should anyone wish to send a brief message, he might use also the following method, which is similar to the preceding. Writing in detail and undisguisedly on some subject, in this message you may reach the same result by marking letters by which you will indicate whatever you may wish. And the marking must be made as inconspicuous as possible, by dots placed far apart or by rather long dashes. These will arouse no suspicion whatsoever in others, but the letter will be clear to the recipient. . . . 4 Let a man be sent bearing some message or even a letter ostensibly about general matters, not secret, and, just before he starts, without his knowledge let a letter be inserted in the sole of his sandals and be sewed in, and, to guard against mud and water, have it written on a piece of thin-beaten tin, so that the writing will not be effaced by the water. 4a And when he reaches the one intended and goes to rest for the night, this person should pull out the stitchings of the sandals, take out and read the letter, and, writing another secretly while the man is still asleep, sew it in and send him back, having given him some message in reply or even something to carry openly. In this way, then, neither the messenger nor anyone else will know the message. 5 It is necessary, however, to make the sewings of the sandals as inconspicuous as possible. 6 Again, a letter was brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> in some such manner as this. A man was sent with a message written on leaves which were bound to a wound on his leg. 7 Writing could be brought in also on thin pieces of beaten lead rolled up and worn in women's ears in place of ear rings. 8 A letter having to do with betrayal was once conveyed by the traitor to the camp of the beleaguering enemy in this way. As the horsemen were going out of the city for a raid upon the enemy one of them had a sheet of papyrus sewn under the flaps of his breastplate, and he was instructed, if the enemy should appear, to fall from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> as though by accident, and to be captured alive; and when he was taken into camp he was to give the sheet of writing to the proper person. The horseman assisted as a brother would a brother. 9 Another man, when sending out a horseman, sewed a sheet of papyrus to the bridle-rein. And the following incident happened about a letter. During the siege of a city, when the man carrying the message entered the town, he did not give the letters to the traitor and to the others to whom he was bringing it, but went to the commanding officer of the city, disclosed the matter, and handed over the letters. 9a When the officer heard it he ordered him to deliver these letters to those to whom he was bringing them, but to bring to him their answer as evidence that he was telling the truth. The informer did so, and the officer, taking the letters, called the men to him, showed them the marks of the seals which they admitted to be their own, and, opening the letters, exposed the matter. 9b And he seems to have detected this skilfully in that he did not accept from the man the letters that were sent. For then it would have been possible for the men to deny it and claim that someone was plotting against them. But by taking the letters that were sent in answer he proved the case incontestably. <br />10 Messages are sent also in this way. Take a bladder in size equal to a flask large enough for your purpose; inflate it, tie it tightly, and let it dry; then write on it whatever you wish, in ink mixed with glue. 11 When the writing is dry, let the air out of the bladder, and press it into the flask, letting the mouth of the bladder protrude from the mouth of the flask. Then inflate the bladder inside the flask in order to expand it as much as possible, and filling it with oil, cut off the part of the bladder that comes over the top of the flask, fitting it in the mouth as inconspicuously as you can, and, corking the bottle, carry it openly. Hence the oil will be visible in the flask, but nothing else. 13 When it comes to the appropriate person, he will pour out the oil, inflate the bladder, and read the writing. And washing it off with a sponge, let him write on it in the same manner and send it back. 14 It has actually happened that someone has written on the wooden part of a tablet, poured wax over it, and written something else on the wax. Then when it came to the appointed person, he, scraping off the wax and reading the writing, again in this way has sent back a message. 15 It would be possible, also, to write on a boxwood tablet with the best quality of ink, let it dry, and then by whitening the tablet to make the letters invisible. When, then, the tablet comes to the recipient, he should take it and put it into water; and so in the water there will clearly appear all that was written. You might also write on a tablet for a hero's chapel whatever you desire. 16 Then it should be whitened and dried, and a light-bringing horseman painted on it, or anything else you please, with white apparel and his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> white; or if not white, any colour except black. Then it should be given to somebody, to be hung up near the city in whatever shrine he may chance upon, as though it were a votive offering. And he whose part it is to read the message must go to the shrine, and recognizing the tablet by some prearranged sign, must take it back home and put it in oil. And so everything written on it will become visible. The most secret method of all for sending messages, but the most difficult, namely, that without writing, I shall now make clear. It is this. 17 In a sufficiently large astragal bore twenty-four holes, six on each side. Let the holes stand for letters, 18 and note clearly on which side begins Alpha and the following letters that have been written on each particular side. Then, whenever you wish to communicate any word by them, draw a thread through them, as, for instance, if you wish to express Αἰνείαν by the drawing through of a thread, begin from the side of the astragal on which Alpha is found, pass the thread through, and omitting the characters placed next to Alpha, draw through again when you come to the side where Iota belongs; and disregarding the characters following this, again pass the thread through where Nu happens to be. And again passing by the succeeding letters draw the thread through where Ei is found. Now continuing in this way to write the rest of the communication, pass the thread into the holes in such a manner as that in which we just now wrote the name. 19 Accordingly, there will be a ball of thread wound around the astragal, and it will be necessary for the one who is to read the information to write down upon a tablet the characters revealed by the holes. The unthreading takes place in the reverse order to that of the thread. But it makes no difference that the letters are written upon the tablet in reverse order, for none the less will the message be read, although to understand what has been written is a greater task than to prepare it. </p>                        </div>

Wherever two insertions occur, the same character being written twice in succession, you should wind the thread around the wood before inserting it. Or it could even be done as follows. 21 Instead of the astragal or the piece of wood, make a disc of wood, polish it, and bore successively on the disc the twenty-four characters of the alphabet; but to avoid suspicion you should bore other holes also in the centre of the disc, and then in this way run the thread through the characters, which are in their regular order. 22 But whenever the writing of the same letter occurs twice in succession, you must insert the thread in the holes bored in the centre of the disc before running it into the same letter; and by letter I mean the hole. 23 Again, some persons, after writing long lines with fine characters upon some very thin papyrus, so that the message may be as compact as possible, have then placed it on the shoulder of the tunic and spread a part of the over-tunic out on the shoulder. Naturally the transmitting of the letter is unsuspected, if one puts on an over-tunic and wears it in this manner. 24 There is proof, however, of the fact that it is difficult to guard against anything sent in by artifice. At any rate the people at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> who have been so long and so well prepared, are not yet able to prevent the coming of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386231ROpu class=demonym long=23.04 lat=38.65>Locrian</a> maidens into their town, although they use such great care and watchfulness. But a few men, bent on deceiving, succeed in secretly bringing in many maidens, at yearly intervals. <br />25 And among the ancients the following scheme was once contrived. When <a href=/people/2456 target=_blank>Timoxenus</a> wished to hand over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a> to <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a>, they prearranged, 26 the one a certain spot in the city, the other one in the camp, to which they used to shoot whatever they wished to communicate with each other. They adopted the device of winding a sheet of writing around the notched end of the arrow, and, after feathering it, they shot it into the places previously determined. 27 But <a href=/people/2456 target=_blank>Timoxenus</a> was discovered in the attempt to betray <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a>. For <a href=/people/667 target=_blank>Artabazus</a>, shooting toward the designated area, missed the spot because of the wind and because the arrow was badly feathered, and hit a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402233UPot class=place long=23.3278 lat=40.1937>Potidaea</a> on the shoulder, and a crowd gathered around the wounded man, as often happens in war. And immediately picking up the arrow, they brought it to the generals, and thus the plot was revealed. 28 Again, <a href=/people/887 target=_blank>Histiaeus</a>, wishing to tell <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a> to revolt, had no other safe means of communicating, since the roads were guarded and it was not easy for a letter-carrier to escape notice, but shaving the head of his most faithful slave, he tattooed it and detained him until the hair had grown again. 29 And as soon as it had grown, he dispatched him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a> and gave the tattooed man no other orders except that when he had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, into the presence of <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a>, he should request him to shave his head and examine it, whereupon the marks indicated what was to be done. </p>                        </div>

In the first place, against objects raised higher than the wall from towers or masts or devices similar to these, there should be stretched on thongs and covered with some impenetrable substance sails which will have to be overshot by the missiles. And in particular one must set smoking materials that will send up a great smudge from beneath, and must kindle those which will rouse as great a blaze as possible, 2 and build in opposition wooden towers, or other high structures with baskets filled with sand, or built of stones or bricks. And even basketwork made of reeds, upright and transverse, woven together, may stop the missiles. 3 Against contrivances for attacking the battlements, such as a ram or other like instrument, you must also make ready protective devices to hang in front of them, sacks full of chaff, and bags of wool, fresh hides inflated or filled with something, and other things similar to these. 4 And when the ram is battering a gate or some other part of the wall, you must catch up with a noose the projecting part of the engine, so that it cannot strike again. 5 And you must make ready a stone large enough to fill a wagon so that it may be let fall upon the drill and crush it. The stone, held in place with grappling hooks, must be dropped from the projecting beams, 6 and in order that in its descent it may not miss the drill, a plumb-line should be lowered in advance, and when it hangs over the drill, then the stone should at once be dropped after it. 7 It is best to adopt this measure also against the engines that are battering the wall: When you see what part of the wall is being attacked, you should prepare a counter ram at that point, inside the wall, and excavate the wall just as far as the outer layer of bricks, so that the enemy may not be aware in advance. And when the ram is close at hand you must strike from within with the counter ram, which must be much more powerful. 8 Furthermore, against the large engines on which many troops are moved up, and from which missiles are shot, and especially catapults and slings, and incendiary arrows against the thatched roofs — against all these, I say, those in the city must, in the first place, secretly dig beneath where the engine is to be applied, so that the wheels of the engines may sink and fall into the excavations. Then, on the inside, you must build a defence of baskets of sand and of stones from what you have near by, which will overtop the engine and render the missiles of the enemy useless. 9 At the same time you must spread out from the inside of the wall thick curtains or sails as a protection from the oncoming shafts, which will stop the missiles that fall over the wall, so that they will be easy to gather up and none will fall to the ground. 10 The same must be done at any other part of the wall where the missiles might come over and injure or wound the helpers and passers by. 11 And at whatever part of the wall can be dug through or broken down, there counter-preparation must be made. 12 To forestall the piercing of the wall a large fire should be built, and to provide against a breach of the wall a trench must be dug inside, so that the enemy may not enter. At the same time you should build a counter-rampart where the breach is being made, before the wall collapses, if you cannot otherwise stop the enemy. </p>                        </div>

If you think a mine is being made you should dig the moat outside the wall as deep as possible so that the mine may open into the moat and those who are digging it may be exposed to view. 2 And if you have a chance, a wall should also be built in the moat, of the very hardest and largest stones available. 3 But if you have no chance to build a stone wall you should bring up logs and rubbish . . ., and if the mines at any point open into the moat, there you should dump the wood and set fire to the rubbish and cover the rest over in order that that smoke may penetrate the opening and injure those in the mine. It is even possible that many of these may be killed by the smoke. 4 And in some instances, by releasing <a href=/people/10963 target=_blank>wasps</a> and <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> into the opening, men have worked mischief with those in the mine. 5 One must, in a word, at whatever point the enemy are digging, construct a countermine beneath and against them, and by setting fire to rubbish in the countermine thus destroy the fighting force in the mine itself. 6 Now an old incident is told . . . of <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a> in his siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325209UBar class=place long=20.8928 lat=32.4983>Barca</a>, when he was trying to dig a mine. The people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325209UBar class=place long=20.8928 lat=32.4983>Barca</a>, who were aware of the attempt of <a href=/people/424 target=_blank>Amasis</a>, were concerned lest he might elude or anticipate them, until a coppersmith thought out a device. Carrying a bronze shield around inside the wall he held it against the ground above various points. 7 And of course at all other points the parts to which he applied the bronze were without a sound, but where the digging was in progress beneath the shield became resonant. So the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325209UBar class=place long=20.8928 lat=32.4983>Barca</a> dug a countermine at this point and killed many of the enemy's miners, and as a result even now men use this means of ascertaining where mines are being dug. 8 I have already explained by what means one should oppose and ward off the devices of the enemy. For those, on the other hand, who are to construct mines, a very effective form of protection would be this. 9 One should fasten together the poles of two wagons, having first turned them back each in the direction of the other part of its wagon, in such a way that the poles may be raised aloft, inclining toward the same point. Then when this has been done, one should fasten on in addition other timbers and hurdles and other sorts of covering above and smear these over with clay. This device, then, can be advanced and withdrawn on its wheels wherever you desire, and those who are excavating can keep under this protection. </p>                        </div>

For the enemy fear the reserves more than the force already on duty before them. And the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> should be tied up at this time, 3 for when men are hurrying through the town, with noise of arms and confusion, if the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> in addition, because of the unusual doings, should begin to run amuck, they would make trouble. 4 And to those who are fighting on the wall the general should give such advice as is necessary for each, to some commendation and to others an appeal, but he should not in anger reprimand anyone, even of the common soldiers, for that would dishearten them the more. 5 If, however, it is necessary to reprimand anyone for neglect and lack of discipline, it should be those who are most wealthy and influential in the city, for such a case would be an example to the others also. The occasions on which it is expedient to overlook each of these matters I have discussed in the work on Admonitions. 6 And one should not permit the throwing of small stones at unsuitable times, but should provide that even those thrown during the day may be gathered again during the night, in the following manner. 7 Men should be let down from the wall in baskets to pick the stones up again, and when they have gathered them they should regain the wall by means of <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>- or stag-nets which have been let down, or else by rope ladders, 8 which should be equal in number to the men who are gathering the stones, so that if any are hard pressed they may quickly climb up again. For the gates must not be opened during the night, but ladders of this sort should be used, and other devices you may choose. </p>                        </div>

At the gates and somewhat inside them they should dig a trench and leave a passage on this side and on that. Then some of them should go out and engage in skirmishing and lure the enemy to make a dash into the town with them. 2 Of course the men from the town, as they retire into it, are to run along the passages that have been left on either side, but it is likely that those of the enemy who run in with them, being unaware of the trench, especially since it is concealed, will fall into it and be killed at that instant by those within the city. And of these some should be stationed in the passages and in places at the trenches near the gate. 3 And if a larger number of the enemy come in after these and you wish to catch them, you should have ready above the centre of the gate a portcullis of the stoutest possible timbers overlaid with iron. 4 When, then, you wish to cut off the enemy as they rush in, you should let this drop down, and the portcullis itself will not only as it falls destroy some of them, but will also keep the foe from entering, while at the same time the forces on the wall are shooting the enemy at the gate. 5 And you should always give instructions in advance to your own party, in case the enemy rush in with them, in what place in the city they are to make their rendezvous, in order that your friends may be distinguished by their position. For it is not easy to distinguish between men in a promiscuous armed throng, rushing confusedly in together. 6 And on some occasions, against enemies who were over-confident and were approaching the wall more closely than was prudent, either by night or by day, the defenders have made ready nets, secretly by day, but by night without attempt at concealment, and luring the enemy forward by skirmishes have hauled up those who became entangled. 7 The net should be of the very strongest rope, and the line that lifts it should be of chain for a distance of two cubits, to prevent its being severed, but the rest, from the point where they are pulling it, may be of rope. The whole device is let down and hauled up from within the wall by ropes or by swing-beams. If, however, the enemy try to cut their way out, then to meet this the besieged should again use swing-beams, letting them down so that the net may not be cut; for to use chains to prevent such an occurrence is troublesome and inconvenient, as well as too costly. </p>                        </div>

And at either side of the parts that have been built up some of the available men should keep watch to destroy those who may leap from the high points. 2 When <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> had subjugated a certain city and some of its defenders had been killed and the others had fled, he wished to retain the place, but it was too large to be guarded by a small force. 3 Accordingly he left some in charge with a few available men, and to the slaves of the most influential in the city he married the daughters, wives, and sisters of their masters; for in this relation he thought that the slaves would be most hostile to their masters and more faithful to him. 4 Again, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=place long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinope</a> in their war against Datamas, when they were in danger and in need of men, disguised the most able-bodied of their women and armed them as much like men as they could, giving them in place of shields and helmets their jars and similar bronze utensils, and marched them around the wall where the enemy were most likely to see them. 5 But they did not allow them to throw missiles, for even a long way of a woman betrays her sex when she tries to throw. While they were doing this they took care that deserters should not disclose the stratagem. 6 If you wish the patrolmen upon the wall to appear more numerous than they are, you should make them go their rounds two abreast, one rank with their spears upon the left shoulder, the other with their spears upon the right, and thus they will appear to be four abreast. 7 And if they go about three abreast, the first man should have his spear upon his right shoulder, the next upon his left, and the others similarly, and in this way each man will look like two. 8 Now about wheatless rations and things of which there is a scarcity during a siege, and about how waters are to be rendered drinkable, a I have explained in the book on Military Preparations. And inasmuch as these points have been described I shall pass on to naval manoeuvres. Of a naval armament there are two forms of equipment. . . . </p>                        </div>
