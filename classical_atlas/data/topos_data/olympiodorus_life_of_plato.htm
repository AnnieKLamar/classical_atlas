For he was not a “Nobody,” but rather With all mankind he was conversant.<br />For <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> is said to have been a son of his father <a href=/people/313 target=_blank>Ariston</a>, the son of <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a>, from whom he traced his descent to <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, the law-giver; and hence he wrote, in emulation of his ancestor, the Laws in twelve books, and Republic in eleven. He came into the world by his mother <a href=/people/5171 target=_blank>Perictione</a>, who was descended from <a href=/people/1278 target=_blank>Neleus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/680 target=_blank>Codrus</a>. For they say that an Apolloniac specter had intercourse with his mother <a href=/people/5171 target=_blank>Perictione</a>, and, appearing in the night to <a href=/people/313 target=_blank>Ariston</a>, ordered him to have no connexion with <a href=/people/5171 target=_blank>Perictione</a> until the time of her bringing forth. And so he acted. And his parents taking him after his birth, and when he was still an infant, placed him on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238LHym class=place long=23.815 lat=37.946>Hymettus</a>, intending to make a sacrifice on his behalf to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238CPan class=place long=23.80185 lat=37.85814>deities there</a>, <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, and the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a>, and to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> Nomios (of flocks). But while he was lying there, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> came and filled his mouth with honey from the comb, in order that it might be said truly of him— From his mouth flow’d a voice than honey far more sweet.<br />And he calls himself on every side and a fellow-slave with the swans, as if he had proceeded from <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>; for the bird belongs to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.</p>                        </div>

After him he made use of <a href=/people/313 target=_blank>Ariston</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=person long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a>, as his master in gymnastics, by whom, as they say, his name was changed into <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, having been previously called <a href=/people/657 target=_blank>Aristocles</a>, after his grandfather; and he was called <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, from his having two parts of his body very wide, namely, his breast and forehead, as his likeness proves, put up every where with such a representation. But others assert that it was not for this reason his name was changed, but on account of the breadth, diffuseness, and openness of the style adopted by him; just as they say that <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, who was previously called <a href=/people/8469 target=_blank>Tyrtamus</a>, had his name changed to <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> on account of the divine nature of his language. For his music-master he had <a href=/people/2513 target=_blank>Dracon</a>, the pupil of <a href=/people/859 target=_blank>Damon</a>, of whom he has made mention in the Republic. These were the three things the boys at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> were taught, I mean grammar, music, and wrestling, not simply for themselves; but grammar, to embellish the language natural to them; music, to tame violent passions; and wrestling and gymnastics, to strengthen the relaxed state of desire. In these three points <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> appears to have been instructed by him; and hence <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> says to him, “But to play on the pipe you were not unwilling,” and what follows.</p>                        </div>

Subsequently he received instructions from the writers of tragedy likewise, who were considered to be the instructors of Greece; and he went to them for the sake of the moral and solemn style of tragedy, and the heroical nature of their subjects (selected by them); and he made an acquaintance with the dithyrambic poets, for the honour of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, who was said to be the superintendent of generation; for to that deity the Dithyramb is sacred, from whom likewise it had its name; for <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> is <a href=/people/5616 target=_blank>Dithyrambus</a>, as having proceeded from two doors, namely, <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a> and the thigh of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. For the ancients were wont to call things caused by the names of the causing; as they call <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> likewise: and hence <a href=/people/524 target=_blank>Proclus</a> says on this subject—<br />Parents, from what they see (and know),<br />Upon their children names bestow.</p>                        </div>

He took likewise great delight in <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>, the comic writer, and in <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a>; from whom he benefited in his imitation of the characters in his dialogues. And he is reported to have been so delighted, that, when he was dead, (copies of) <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> and <a href=/people/1229 target=_blank>Sophron</a> were found on his couch; and he himself made this epigram upon <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a>: <br />The Graces, when they wish’d to find <br />A precinct, that should for ever live, <br />Said, what they sought, alone the mind <br />Of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> could give. <br />And he made fun of <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in his dialogue the Symposium, as having derived some benefit in the style of comedy. For after making him hymn <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, he introduces him as seized during (the conversation) with hiccups, and unable to finish the hymn. He composed likewise tragic and dithyrambic poetry, and some other things; all of which he burnt, after he had tried <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>'s discourse, and pronouncing a verse of this kind— <br />Come here, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> needs thy aid. <br />And a certain <a href=/people/4410 target=_blank>Anatolius</a>, a grammarian, on speaking (again) the verse, was in some repute with <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, who had been appointed governor of the city; for he said to him— <br />Come here, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a>, Pharus needs thy aid. <br />They say, moreover, that when <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> was about to receive him (as a disciple), he saw, as a vision in a dream, that a swan without wings had settled on his knees; and, becoming fledged on the instant, flew up to the sky, and sung something so sweet, that he enchanted all who heard it; and this indicated the future fame of the man. But after the death of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, he again made use of <a href=/people/3010 target=_blank>Cratylus</a>, one of the sect of <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heracleitus</a>, as his teacher; on whom he composed the dialogue of that name, inscribing it <a href=/people/3010 target=_blank>Cratylus</a>, or On the Correctness of Names. Afterwards he sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; and finding that <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a> had established there a didaskaleion (school) of <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a>, he again had as a teacher the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagorean</a> of the same name; there he has made mention of <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a>.</p>                        </div>

After making many his admirers, and benefiting most of them, when he was about to die, he had a dream, how that having become a swan, he went from tree to tree, and caused the greatest trouble to bird-limers. This <a href=/people/386 target=_blank>Simmias</a>, the <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> philosopher, expounded (by saying) that he would be not caught by those, who after him wished to interpret him; for the interpreters who wanted to catch the meaning of the ancients were like bird-limers; and not caught he is; since one may take his words, like those of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, in a sense physical, moral, ethical, theological, and, (to speak) simply, in a variety of senses. For these two souls are said to be altogether in harmony; and hence one may take them both in various senses.</p>                        </div>
