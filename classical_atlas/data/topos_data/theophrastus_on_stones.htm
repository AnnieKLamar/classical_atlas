For perhaps some are produced in one of these ways, and some in the other way, and others in a different manner. Hence they gain their smoothness, density, brightness, transparency, and other such qualities, and the more uniform and pure each of them is, the more do these qualities appear.

There are more peculiarities in stones; for most of the differences in the types of earth concern color, tenacity, smoothness, density, and so on, but in other respects the differences are rare. </p>                        </div>

They are smooth in nature and like pebbles, flat and not round, and in size they are twice as big as the largest pebble. The top part, which has faced the sun, differs from the lower surface in its testing power and tests better than the other. This is because the upper surface is drier, for moisture prevents it from picking out the metal. Even in hot weather the stone does not test so well, for then it gives out moisture, which causes slipping. This happens also to other stones, including those from which statues are made, and this is supposed to be a peculiarity of the statue. </p>                        </div>

The vein stretches for a long way and is about two feet in height, though much greater in depth. It is surrounded on both sides by stones and is taken out from the space between them. It has a stratum right through the middle, and this is better than the parts on the outside; and then it has another stratum, and still another, up to four ... . The innermost earth is called the star. This earth is used mainly or solely for clothes. </p>                        </div>

Gypsos occurs in large quantities in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> and can easily be seen; for only a little soil is removed when it is dug up.

Its nature is peculiar; for it is more like stone than earth, and the stone resembles alabastrites. It is not cut out in a large mass but in small pieces. Its stickiness and heat, when it is wet, are remarkable; for it is used on buildings and is poured around the stone or anything else of this kind that one wishes to fasten. </p>                        </div>

And it is wetted immediately before it is used; for if this is done a short time before, it quickly hardens and it is impossible to divide it. Its strength, too, is remarkable; for when the stones are broken or pulled apart, the gypsos does not become loose, and often part of a structure falls down and is taken away, while the part hanging up above remains there, held together by the binding force. </p>                        </div>
