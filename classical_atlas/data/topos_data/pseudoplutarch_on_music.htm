ONESICRATES, SOTERICHUS, LYSIAS. <br />The wife of <a href=/people/182 target=_blank>Phocion</a> the just was always wont to maintain that her chiefest glory consisted in the warlike achievements of her husband. For my part, I am of opinion that all my glory, not only that peculiar to myself, but also what is common to all my familiar friends and relations, flows from the care and diligence of my master that taught me learning. For the most renowned performances of great commanders tend only to the preservation of some few private soldiers or the safety of a single city or nation, but make neither the soldiers nor the citizens nor the people any thing the better. But true learning, being the essence and body of felicity and the source of prudence, we find to be profitable and beneficial, not only to one house or city or nation, but to all the race of men. Therefore by how much the more the benefit and advantage of learning transcends the profits of military performances, by so much the more is it to be remembered and mentioned, as most worthy your study and esteem. </p>                        </div>

After all had done and the table was cleared, — To dive, said he, most worthy friends, into the nature and reason of the human voice is not an argument proper for this merry meeting, as being a subject that requires a more sober scrutiny. But because our chiefest grammarians define the voice to be a percussion of the air made sensible to the ear, and for that we were yesterday discoursing of Grammar, — which is an art that can give the voice form and shape by means of letters, and store it up in the memory as a magazine, — let us consider what is the next science to this which may be said to relate to the voice. In my opinion, it must be music. For it is one of the chiefest and most religious duties belonging to man, to celebrate the praise of the Gods, who gave to him alone the most excelling advantage of articulate discourse, as <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> has observed in the following verses: With sacred hymns and songs that sweetly please, The Grecian youth all day the Gods appease; Their lofty paeans bright <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> hears, And still the charming sounds delight his ears. Now then, you that are of the grand musical chorus, tell your friends, who was the first that brought music into use; what time has added for the advantage of the science; who have been the most famous of its professors; and lastly, for what and how far it may be beneficial to mankind. </p>                        </div>

Noble <a href=/people/5142 target=_blank>Onesicrates</a>, said he, you desire the solution of a hard question, that has been by many already proposed. For of the Platonics the most, of the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a> philosophers the best, have made it their business to compile several treatises concerning the ancient music and the reasons why it came to lose its pristine perfection. Nay, the very grammarians and musicians themselves who arrived to the height of education have expended much time and study upon the same subject, whence has arisen great variety of discording opinions among the several writers. <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> in his Compendium of <a href=/people/1268 target=_blank>Music</a> asserts, that <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> and <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>, was the first that invented playing on the harp and lyric poesy, being first instructed by his father; which is confirmed by a small manuscript, preserved in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a>, wherein is set down a catalogue of the priests, poets, and musicians of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>. In the same age, he tells us, <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385239IEub class=person long=23.87 lat=38.53>Euboean</a> composed several elegies; <a href=/people/5435 target=_blank>Anthes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385235PAnt class=person long=23.448 lat=38.4987>Anthedon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> was the first author of hymns, and <a href=/people/2686 target=_blank>Pierus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=person long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pieria</a> the first that wrote in the praise of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. <a href=/people/1462 target=_blank>Philammon</a> also, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphian</a>, set forth in verse a poem in honor of the nativity of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a>, <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, and <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and was the first that instituted dancing about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SApo class=place long=22.5011 lat=38.48225>temple</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>. <a href=/people/2354 target=_blank>Thamyras</a>, of Thracian extraction, had the best voice and the neatest manner of singing of any of his time; so that the poets feigned him to be a contender with the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. He is said to have described in a poem the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>' war against the Gods. There was also <a href=/people/1474 target=_blank>Demodocus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=person long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyraean</a>, who is said to have written the Destruction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, and the Nuptials of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> and <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>; and then Phemius of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383207IIth class=person long=20.71 lat=38.34>Ithaca</a> composed a poem, entitled The Return of those who came back with <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Not that any of these stories before cited were complied in a style like prose without metre; they were rather like the poems of <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesichorus</a> and other ancient lyric poets, who composed in heroic verse and added a musical accompaniment. The same <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> writes that <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a>, the first that instituted the lyric nomes, set verses of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> as well as his own to music according to each of these nomes, and sang them at public trials of skill. He also was the first to give names to the lyric nomes. In imitation of <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a>, <a href=/people/4934 target=_blank>Clonas</a>, an elegiac and epic poet, first instituted nomes for flute-music, and also the songs called <a href=/people/8214 target=_blank>Prosodia</a>. And <a href=/people/2919 target=_blank>Polymnestus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381272PCol class=person long=27.141 lat=38.111>Colophonian</a> in later times used the same measure in his compositions. </p>                        </div>

To these succeeding ages added another sort, which were called Polymnastia. But the measures set down for those that played and sung to the harp, being the invention of <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a>, were much more ancient than the former. To these he gave the several appellations of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=demonym long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotian</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=demonym long=27.1 lat=39>Aeolian</a>, Trochaean, the Acute, Cepion, Terpandrian, and Tetraoedian. And <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a> made preludes to be sung to the lyre in heroic verse. Besides, <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> testifies how that the lyric nomes were anciently appropriated to epic verses. For <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a> merely intermixed the dithyrambic style with the ancient nomes in heroic measure, and thus sang them, that he might not seem to make too sudden an innovation upon the ancient music. But as for <a href=/people/1164 target=_blank>Terpander</a>, he seems to have been the most excellent composer to the harp of his age, for he is recorded to have been four times in succession a victor at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=demonym long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythian</a> games. And certainly he was one of the most ancient musicians in the world; for <a href=/people/241 target=_blank>Glaucus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> in his treatise of the ancient poets and musicians asserts him to have lived before <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>, affirming him to be the second next to those that first invented wind-music. </p>                        </div>

And it is thought that the invention of the enharmonic species was thus brought to pass: for that <a href=/people/873 target=_blank>Olympus</a> before altogether composing and playing in the diatonic species, and having frequent occasion to shift to the diatonic parhypate, sometimes from the paramese and sometimes from the mese, skipping the diatonic lichanos, he found the beauty that appeared in the new character; and thus, admiring a conjunction or scheme so agreeable to proportion, he made this new species in the <a href=/people/476 target=_blank>Doric</a> mood. For now he held no longer to what belonged either to the diatonic or to the chromatic, but he was already come to the enharmonic. And the first foundations of enharmonic music which he laid were these: in enharmonics the first thing that appears is the spondiasmus, to which none of the divisions of the tetrachord seems properly to belong, unless any one will take the more intense spondiasmus to be diatonic. But he that maintained this would maintain a falsehood and an absurdity in harmony; a falsehood, because it would be less by a diesis than is required by the leading note; an absurdity in harmony, because, even if we should place the proper nature of the more intense spondiasmus in the simple chromatic, it would then come to pass, that two double tones would follow in order, the one compounded, the other uncompounded. For the thick enharmonic now used in the middle notes does not seem to be the invention of the fore-mentioned author. But this is more easily understood by hearing any musician play in the ancient style; for then you shall find the semi-tone in the middle parts to be uncompounded. These were the beginnings of enharmonic music; afterwards the semitone was also divided, as well in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> moods.

For in his discourse concerning the procreation of the soul, inserted into <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a>, he has made known his great knowledge in all the sciences, and of music among the rest, in this manner: After this, saith he, he filled up the double and treble intervals, taking parts from thence, and adding them to the midst between them, so that there were in every interval two middle terms. This proem was the effect of his experience in music, as we shall presently make out. The means from whence every mean is taken are three, arithmetical, enharmonical, geometrical. Of these the first exceeds and is exceeded in number, the second in proportion, the third neither in number nor proportion. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> therefore, desirous to show the harmony of the four elements in the soul, and harmonically also to explain the reason of that mutual concord arising from discording and jarring principles, undertakes to make out two middle terms of the soul in every interval, according to harmonical proportion. Thus in a musical octave there happen to be two middle distances, whose proportion we shall explain. As for the octaves, they keep a double proportion between their two extremes. For example, let the double arithmetical proportion be 6 and 12, this being the interval between the ὑπάτη μέσων and the νήτη διεζευγμένων; 6 therefore and 12 being the two extremes, the former note contains the number 6, and the latter 12. To these are to be added the intermediate numbers, to which the extremes must hold the proportion, the one of one and a third, and the other of one and a half. These are the numbers 8 and 9. For as 8 contains one and a third of 6, so 9 contains one and a half of 6; thus you have one extreme. The other is 12, containing 9 and a third part of 9, and 8 and half 8. These then being the numbers between 6 and 12, and the interval of the octave consisting of a diatessaron and diapente, it is plain that the number 8 belongs to mese, and the number 9 to paramese; which being so, it follows that hypate is to mese as paramese to nete of the disjunct tetrachords; for it is a fourth from the first term to the second of this proportion, and the same interval from the third term to the fourth. The same proportion will be also found in the numbers. For as 6 is to 8, so is 9 to 12; and as 6 is to 9, so is 8 to 12. For 8 is one and a third part of 6, and 12 of 9; while 9 is one and a half part of 6, and 12 of 8. What has been said may suffice to show how great was <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s zeal and learning in the liberal sciences. </p>                        </div>

As for its members, its dimensions, and its excesses of intervals, they are best discovered by number and equality of measure, the whole art being contained in two tetrachords. These are his words. The body of it, he saith, consists of discording parts, yet concording one with another; whose means nevertheless agree according to arithmetical proportion. For the upper string being fitted to the lowest in the ratio of two to one produces a perfect diapason. Thus, as we said before, nete consisting of twelve units, and hypate of six, the paramese accords with hypate according to the sesquialter proportion, and has nine units, whilst mese has eight units. So that the chiefest intervals through the whole scale are the diatessaron (which is the proportion of 4:3), the diapente (which is the proportion of 3:2), and the diapason (which is the proportion of 2:1); while the proportion of 9:8 appears in the interval of a tone. With the same inequalities of excess or diminution, all the extremes are differenced one from another, and the means from the means, either according to the quantity of the numbers or the measure of geometry; which <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> thus explains, observing that nete exceeds mese by a third part of itself, and hypate is exceeded by paramese in the same proportion, so that the excesses stand in proportion. For by the same parts of themselves they exceed and are exceeded; that is, the extremes (nete and hypate) exceed and are exceeded by mese and paramese in the same proportions, those of 4:3 and of 3:2. Now these excesses are in what is called harmonic progression. But the distances of nete from mese and of paramese from hypate, expressed in numbers, are in the same proportion (12:8 equals 9:6); for paramese exceeds mese by one-eighth of the latter. Again, nete is to hypate as 2:1; paramese to hypate as 3:2; and mese to hypate as 4:3. This, according to <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, is the natural constitution of harmony, as regards its parts and its numbers. </p>                        </div>

For harmony takes cognizance of intervals, systems, classes of harmonious sounds, notes, tones, and systematical transmutations. Farther than this it goes not. And therefore it would be in vain to enquire of harmony, whether the poet have rightly and (so to speak) musically chosen the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> for the beginning, the mixed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> for the end, or the Hypophrygian and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> for the middle. For the industry of harmony reaches not to these, and it is defective in many other things, as not understanding the force and extent of elegant aptness and proper concinnity. Neither did ever the chromatic or enharmonic species arrive to such force of aptitude as to discover the nature and genius of the poem; for that is the work of the poet. It is as plain, that the sound of the system is different from the sound of the descant sung in the same system; which, however, does not belong to the consideration of harmonical studies. There is the same to be said concerning rhythms, for no rhythm can claim to itself the force of perfect aptitude. For we call a thing apt and proper when we consider the nature of it. The reason of this, we say, is either a certain plain and mixed composure, or both; like the enharmonic species of <a href=/people/873 target=_blank>Olympus</a>, by him set in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> mood and mixed with the paeon epibatos, which rendered the beginning of the key naturally elegant in what is called the nome of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. For having made choice of his key and measure, he only changed the paeon epibatos for the trochee, which produced his enharmonic species. However, the enharmonic species and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=demonym long=31 lat=40>Phrygian</a> tone remaining together with the whole system, the elegancy of the character was greatly altered. For that which was called harmony in the nome of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> was quite another thing from that in the introduction. He then that has both judgment as well as skill is to be accounted the most accurate musician. For he that understands the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> mood, not being able withal to discern by his judgment what is proper to it and when it is fit to be made use of, shall never know what he does; nay, he shall quite mistake the nature and custom of the key. Indeed it is much questioned among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a> themselves, whether the enharmonic composers be competent judges of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=demonym long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorian</a> songs. The same is to be said concerning the knowledge of rhythm. For he that understands a paeon may not understand the proper use of it, though he know the measure of which it consists. Because it is much doubted among those that make use of paeons, whether the bare knowledge make a man capable to determine concerning the proper use of those rhythms; or, as others say, whether it aspire to presume so far. Therefore it behooves that person to have two sorts of knowledge, who will undertake to judge of what is proper and what improper; first, of the custom and manner of elegancy for which such a composition was intended, and next of those things of which the composition consists. And thus, that neither the bare knowledge of harmony, nor of rhythm, nor of any other things that singly by themselves are but a part of the whole body of music, is sufficient to judge and determine either of the one or the other, what has been already said may suffice to prove. </p>                        </div>

The further subdivision indeed caused some little variance, but they nearly all agreed that harmony itself is but one. ] Therefore he must never think to be a true artist in the understanding and practice of music, who advances no farther than the single knowledge of this or that particular: but it behooves him to trace through all the particular members of it, and so to be master of the whole body, by understanding how to mix and join all the divided members. For he that understands only harmony is confined to a single manner. Wherefore, in short, it is requisite that the sense and understanding concur in judging the parts of music; and that they should neither be too hasty, like those senses which are rash and forward, nor too slow, like those which are dull and heavy; though it may happen sometimes, through the inequality of Nature, that the same senses may be too slow and too quick at the same time.

By the note we judge of the harmony, by the time of the rhythm, and by the word of the matter or subject of the song. As these proceed forth altogether, it is requisite the sense should give them entrance at the same moment. But this is certain, where the sense is not able to separate every one of these and consider the effects of each apart, there it can never apprehend what is well or what is amiss in any. First therefore let us discourse concerning coherence. For it is necessary that coherence accompany the discerning faculty. For judgment of good or bad is not to be made from notes disjoined, broken time, and shattered words, but from coherence. For there is in practice a certain commixture of parts which commonly are not compounded. So much as to coherence. </p>                        </div>

Now I aver the negative. For it is impossible to be a perfect musician and a good judge of music by the knowledge of those things that seem to be but parts of the whole body, as by excellency of hand upon the instrument, or singing readily at first sight, or exquisiteness of the ear, so far as this extends to the understanding of harmony and time. Neither does the knowledge of time and harmony, pulsation or elocution, or whatever else falls under the same consideration, perfect their judgment. Now for the reasons why a musician cannot gain a perfect judgment from any of these, we must endeavor to make them clear. First then it must be granted that, of things about which judgment is to be made, some are perfect and others imperfect. Those things which are perfect are the compositions in general, whether sung or played, and the expression of those, whether upon the instruments or by the voice, with the rest of the same nature. The imperfect are the things to these appertaining, and for whose sake they are made use of. Such are the parts of expression. A second reason may be found in poetry, with which the case is the same. For a man that hears a consort of voices or instruments can judge whether they sing or play in tune, and whether the language be plain or not. But every one of these are only parts of instrumental and vocal expression; not the end itself, but for the sake of the end. For by these and things of the same nature shall the elegancy of elocution be judged, whether it be proper to the poem which the performer undertakes to sing. The same is to be said of the several passions expressed in the poetry. </p>                        </div>

And so negligent and lazy are they grown, as to believe the enharmonic diesis to be too contemptible to fall under the apprehension of sense, and they therefore exterminate it out of their compositions, deeming those to be triflers that have any esteem for it or make use of the mood itself. For proof of which they think they bring a most powerful argument, which rather appears to be the dulness of their own senses; as if whatever fled their apprehensions were to be rejected as useless and of no value. And then again they urge that its magnitude cannot be perceived through its concord, like that of the semitone, tone, and other distances; not understanding, that at the same time they throw out the third, fifth, and seventh, of which the one consists of three, the other of five, and the last of seven dieses. And on the same principle all the intervals that are odd should be rejected as useless, inasmuch as none of them is perceptible through concord; and this would include all which by means of even the smallest diesis are measured by odd numbers.

To which our <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a> agrees, who alleges that music was introduced at banquets for this reason, that as wine intemperately drunk weakens both the body and mind, so music by its harmonious order and symmetry assuages and reduces them to their former constitution.

For <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, <a href=/people/944 target=_blank>Archytas</a>, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, and many others of the ancient philosophers, were of opinion, that there could be no motion of the world or rolling of the spheres without the assistance of music, since the Supreme Deity created all things harmoniously. But it would be unseasonable now to enter upon such a discourse, especially at this time, when it would be absurd for <a href=/people/1268 target=_blank>Music</a> to transgress her highest and most musical office, which is to give the laws and limits of time and measure to all things. Therefore after he had sung a paean, and offered to <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> and his offspring, with all the other Gods and the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, he dismissed the company. </p>                        </div>
