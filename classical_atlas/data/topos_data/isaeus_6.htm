When the latter also died, Chaerestratus claimed possession in accordance with the law. When <a href=/people/10996 target=_blank>Androcles</a> lodged a protestation that the estate was not adjudicable because <a href=/people/1046 target=_blank>Euctemon</a> had a legitimate son, namely, <a href=/people/4418 target=_blank>Antidorus</a>, Chaerestratus and his supporters impugned the protestation, declaring that both <a href=/people/4418 target=_blank>Antidorus</a> and his sister were illegitimate and that the law ordains that an illegitimate son or daughter cannot inherit as next-of-kin. The discussion turns on questions of fact; for it is uncertain whether <a href=/people/12064 target=_blank>Philoctemon</a> adopted Chaerestratus as his son, and further, whether <a href=/people/4418 target=_blank>Antidorus</a> and the other child are legitimate. <br />That I am on terms of very close friendship with <a href=/people/3657 target=_blank>Phanostratus</a> and with Chaerestratus here, I think most of you, gentlemen, are aware, but to those who are not aware of it I will give a convincing proof. When Chaerestratus set sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> in command of a trireme, although, having sailed thither myself before, I knew well all the dangers which I should encounter, yet, at the request of these friends of mine, I sailed with him and shared his misfortune, and we were both made prisoners of war.</p>                        </div>
