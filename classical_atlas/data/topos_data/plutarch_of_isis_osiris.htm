Much more ought we, when we would aim at that knowledge of them which our nature can arrive at, to pray that they themselves would bestow it upon us; truth being the greatest good that man can receive, and the goodliest blessing that God can give. Other good things he bestows on men as they want them, they being not his own peculiars nor of any use to himself. For the blessedness of the Deity consists not in silver and gold, nor yet his power in lightnings and thunders, but in knowledge and wisdom. And it was the best thing <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> ever said of Gods, when he pronounced thus: Both of one line, both of one country boast, But royal <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s the eldest and knows most; where he declares <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>'s prerogative in wisdom and science to be the more honorable, by terming it the elder. I, for my own part, do believe that the felicity of eternal living which the Gods enjoy lies mainly in this, that nothing escapes their cognizance that passes in the sphere of generation, and that, should we set aside wisdom and the knowledge of true beings, immortality itself would not be life, but merely a long time. </p>                        </div>

For the name of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> is Greek, and so is that of her adversary <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, who, being puffed up through ignorance and mistake, pulls in pieces and destroys that holy doctrine, which she on the contrary collects, compiles, and delivers down to such as are regularly advanced unto the deified state; which, by constancy of sober diet, and abstaining from sundry meats and the use of women, both restrains the intemperate and voluptuous part, and habituates them to austere and hard services in the temples, the end of which is the knowledge of the original, supreme, and mental being, which the Goddess would have them enquire for, as near to herself and as dwelling with her. Besides, the very name of her temple most apparently promises the knowledge and acquaintance of true being (τὸ ὄν), for they call it Iseion (Ἴσειον), as who should say, We shall know true being, if with reason and sanctimony we approach the sacred temples of this Goddess. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore, in that the priests of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> are dressed up in these when they are dead, it is a token to us that this doctrine goes with them to the other life, and that nothing else can accompany them thither. For as neither the nourishing of beards nor the wearing of mantles can render men philosophers, so neither will linen garments or shaved heads make priests to <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>; but he is a true priest of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, who, after he hath received from the laws the representations and actions that refer to the Gods, doth next apply his reason to the enquiry and speculation of the truth contained in them. </p>                        </div>

Some are not at all solicitous to be informed about such questions; and others say their veneration for <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> is the cause why they abstain from their wool as well as their flesh, and that they shave their heads in token of mourning, and that they wear linen because of the bloomy color which the flax sendeth forth, in imitation of that ethereal clarity that environs the world. But indeed the true reason of them all is one and the same. For it is not lawful (as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> saith) for a clean thing to be touched by an unclean; but now no superfluity of food or excrementitious substance can be pure or clean; but wool, down, hair, and nails come up and grow from superfluous excrements. It would be therefore an absurdity for them to lay aside their own hair in purgations, by shaving themselves and by making their bodies all over smooth, and yet in the mean time to wear and carry about them the hairs of brutes. For we ought to think that the poet <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, when he saith, Not at a feast of Gods from five-branched tree With sharp-edged steel to part the green from dry, would teach us to keep the feast when we are already cleansed from such things as these, and not in the solemnities themselves to use purgation or removal of excrementitious superfluities. But now flax springs up from an immortal being, the earth, and bears an eatable fruit, and affords a simple and cleanly clothing, not burdensome to him that is covered with it, and convenient for every season of the year, and which besides (as they tell us) is the least subject to engender vermin; but of this to discourse in this place would not be pertinent. </p>                        </div>

For which, as they have several other good reasons, so more especially this, that it whets the appetite and renders men over-eager after meat and drink. For that the reason why salt is not accounted clean should be (as <a href=/people/647 target=_blank>Aristagoras</a> tells us) because that, when it is hardened together, many little animals are catched in it and there die, is fond and ridiculous.

The rest of them do indeed use it, but very sparingly. They have likewise many purgations, wherein they prohibit the use of wine, in which they study philosophy, and pass their time in learning and teaching things divine. Moreover their kings, being priests also themselves, were wont to drink it by a certain measure prescribed them in the sacred books, as <a href=/people/745 target=_blank>Hecataeus</a> informs us. And they began first to drink it in the reign of <a href=/people/1027 target=_blank>Psammetichus</a>; but before that time they were not used to drink wine at all, no, nor to pour if forth in sacrifice as a thing they thought any way grateful to the Gods, but as the blood of those who in ancient times waged war against the Gods, from whom, falling down from heaven and mixing with the earth, they conceived vines to have first sprung; which is the reason (say they) that drunkenness renders men besides themselves and mad; they being, as it were, gorged with the blood of their ancestors. These things (as <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> tells us in the second book of his Travels) are thus related by the priests. </p>                        </div>

Upon the first of these, as they say, <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> was born, and a voice came into the world with him, saying, The Lord of all things is now born. There are others that affirm that one Pamyles, as he was fetching water at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, heard a voice out of the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, bidding him to publish with a loud voice that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>, the great and good king, was now born; and that he thereupon got to be foster-father to <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> entrusting him with the charge of him, and that the feast called <a href=/people/9975 target=_blank>Pamylia</a> (resembling the Priapeian procession which the Greeks call Phallephoria) was instituted in honor of him.

Upon the third <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> was born, who came not into the world either in due time or by the right way, but broke a hole in his mother's side, and leaped out at the wound. Upon the fourth <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> was born in Panygra.

And finding afterwards that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> had made his court to her sister, and through mistake enjoyed her instead of herself, for token of which she had found the melilot garland which he had left hard by <a href=/people/3054 target=_blank>Nephthys</a>, she went to seek for the child; for her sister had immediately exposed it as soon as she was delivered of it, for fear of her husband <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>. And when with great difficulty and labor she had found it, by means of certain <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> which conducted her to it, she brought it up; and he afterwards became her guardsman and follower, being named <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>, and reported to guard the Gods as <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> do men. </p>                        </div>

Upon which the king of that place, much admiring at the unusual bigness of the plant, and cropping off the bushy part that encompassed the now invisible chest, made of it a post to support the roof of his house.

The queen, perceiving that her women's bodies and hair thus breathed of ambrosia, greatly longed to become acquainted with this new stranger. Upon this she being sent for, and becoming very intimate with the queen, was at last made nurse to her child. Now the name of this king (they tell us) was Malcander; and the queen, some say, was called <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a>, and some Saosis, and others Nemanun (which in Greek is as much as to say <a href=/people/5484 target=_blank>Athenais</a>). </p>                        </div>

Upon which the Goddess discovered herself, and begged the post that held up the roof; which when she had obtained and taken down, she very quickly cropped off the bushy heath from about it and wrapping the trunk in fine linen and pouring perfumed oil upon it, she put it into the hands of their kings; and therefore the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/341356PByb class=ethnic long=35.646 lat=34.119>Byblians</a> to this very day worship that piece of wood, laying it up in the temple of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>.

He asked him a second time, what animal he esteemed most useful to such as would go to battle. <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a> told him, a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>; to which he said that he wondered much at his answer, and could not imagine why he did not rather name a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> than a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>. <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a> replied, that a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> might indeed be very serviceable to one that needed help, but a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> would serve best to cut off and disperse a flying enemy.

For they hold that what is fit to be made a sacrifice must not be of a thing agreeable to the Gods, but contrariwise, such things as contain the souls of ungodly and wicked men transformed into their shapes. Wherefore in the more ancient times they were wont, after they had pronounced a solemn curse upon the head of the sacrifice, and had cut it off, to fling it into the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>; but now they distribute it among strangers. Those also among the priests that were termed Sphragistae or Sealers were wont to seal the beast that was to be offered; and the engraving of their seal was (as <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> tells us) a man upon his knees with his hands tied behind him, and a knife set under his throat. They believe, moreover, that the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> suffers for being like him (as hath been already spoken of), as much for the stupidity and sensualness of his disposition as for the redness of his color. Wherefore, because of all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> monarchs they had the greatest aversion for <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a>, as looking upon him as a villanous and abominable person, they gave him the nickname of the <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>; upon which he replied: But this <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> shall dine upon your <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>.

And now we begin at another head, which is the account of those who seem to offer at something more philosophical; and of these we will first consider the more simple and plain sort. And they are those that tell us that, as the Greeks are used to allegorize <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a> (or <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>) into chronos (time), and <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> (or <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>) into aer (air) and also to resolve the generation of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> into the change of air into fire, so also among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> is the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, who accompanies with <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, which is the earth; and <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> is the sea, into which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> falling is thereby destroyed and scattered, excepting only that part of it which the earth receives and drinks up, by means whereof she becomes prolific. There is also a kind of a sacred lamentation used to <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, wherein they bemoan him who was born in the left side of the world, and died in the right. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> believe the eastern part to be the world's face, and the northern its right hand, and the southern its left. And therefore the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, holding its course from the southern parts towards the northern, may justly be said to have its birth in the left side and its death in the right; for which reason, the priests account the sea abominable, and call salt <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>'s foam. And it is one of the things they look upon as unlawful and prohibited to them, to use salt at their tables. And they use not to salute any pilots, because they have to do with the sea. And this is not the least reason of their so great aversedness to fish. They also make the picture of a fish to denote hatred. And therefore at the temple of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309307USai class=place long=30.7693 lat=30.9666>Sais</a> there was carved in the porch an infant and an old man, and after them a hawk, and then a fish, and after all a hippopotamus, which, in a symbolical manner, contained this sentence: O! ye that are born and that die, God hateth impudence. From whence it is plain, that by a child and an old man they express our being born and our dying; by a hawk, God; by a fish, hatred (by reason of the sea, as hath been before spoken); and by a river-horse, impudence, because (as they say) he killeth his sire and forceth his dam. That also which the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> are used to say, that the sea is the tear of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>, may seem to hint out to us that it is not pure nor congenial with our race. </p>                        </div>

For they hang about them the skins of hinds, and carry branches in their hands, and use the same kind of shoutings and gesticulations that the ecstatics do at the inspired dances of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>.

Likewise the tales about the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>, and what they call the Mystic Night, have a strange agreement with what they tell us of the discerptions, resurrections, and regenerations of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>; as also what relates to their sepulchres. For not only the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> (as hath been already spoken) do show in many several places the chests in which <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> lies; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a> also believe that the relics of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> are laid up with them just by the oracle-place; and the Hosii (or holy men) perform a secret sacrifice within the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SApo class=place long=22.5011 lat=38.48225>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, when the <a href=/people/6995 target=_blank>Thyiades</a> rouse the God of the fan (as they call him).

And a pitcher of water goes always first in their sacred processions, in honor of the God. And they make the figure of a figleaf both for the king and the southern climate, which figleaf is interpreted to mean the watering and fructifying of the universe, for it seems to bear some resemblance in its make to the virilities of a man. Moreover, when they keep the feast of the <a href=/people/9975 target=_blank>Pamylia</a>, which is a Phallic or Priapeian one (as was said before), they expose to view and carry about a certain image of a man with a threefold privity; for this God is a first origin, and every first origin doth by its fecundity multiply what proceeds from it. And we are commonly used instead of many times to say thrice, as thrice happy, and, As many bonds thrice told, and infinite. Unless (by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>) we are to understand the word treble as spoken by the ancients in a proper sense. For the humid nature, being in the beginning the chief source and origin of the universe, must of consequence produce the three first bodies, — the earth, air, and fire. For the story which is here told by way of surplusage to the tale — how that <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> threw the privity of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> into the river, and that <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> could not find it, and therefore fashioned and prepared the resemblance and effigies of it, and appointed it to be worshipped and carried about in their processions, like as in the Grecian Phallephoria — amounts but to this, to instruct and teach us that the prolific and generative property of this God had moisture for its first matter, and that by means of moisture it came to immix itself with things capable of generation. We have also another story told us by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, — how that once Apopis, brother to the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a>, fell at variance with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and made war upon him; but <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, entering into an alliance with <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and by his means overthrowing his enemy in a pitched battle, afterwards adopted him for his son and gave him the name of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. It is easy to show that this fabular relation borders also upon the verity of physical science. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> call the wind <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, with which the parching and fiery property makes war; and though this be not the sun, yet hath it some cognation with the sun.

For the story that is told us of the closing up of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> in a chest seems to me to be nothing else but an imitation of the withdrawing and disappearing of the water. For which reason they tell us that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> was missing upon the month of <a href=/people/5486 target=_blank>Athyr</a>; at which time the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds being wholly ceased, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> returns to his channel, and the country looks bare; the night also growing longer, the darkness increases, and so the power of light fades away and is overcome. And as the priests act several other melancholy things upon this occasion, so they cover a gilded <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> with a black linen pall, and thus expose her to public view at the mourning of the Goddess, for four days together, beginning at the seventeenth of the month. For the things they mourn for are also four; the first whereof is the falling and recess of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>; the second, because the northern winds are then quite suppressed by the southern overpowering them; the third, because the day is grown shorter than the night; and the last and chiefest of all, the barrenness of the earth, together with the nakedness of the trees, which then cast their leaves. And on the nineteenth day at night they go down to the sea-side, and the priest and sacred livery bring forth the chest, having within it a little golden ark into which they pour fresh and potable water, and all that are there present give a great shout for joy that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> is now found. Then they take fertile mould, and stir it about in that water, and when they have mixed with it several very costly odors and spices, they form it into a little image, in fashion like a crescent, and then dress it up in fine clothes and adorn it, intimating hereby that they believe these Gods to be the substance of earth and water. </p>                        </div>

For it would be impossible for the world to be complete and perfect, if the property of fire should fail and be wanting. And as these things are not spoken by them without a considerable show of reason, so neither have we reason wholly to contemn this other account which they give us; which is, that <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> in the more ancient times was master of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>'s portion.

But in process of time, <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a> got the upper hand of <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>; that is, there happened such an opportunity of sudden and tempestuous showers of rain, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> pushed the sea out, and discovered the champaign land, and afterwards filled it up with continual profusions of mud; all which hath the testimony of sense to confirm it. For we see at this day that, as the river drives down fresh mud and lays new earth unto the old, the sea by degrees gives back and the salt water runs off, as the parts in the bottom gain height by new accessions of mud.

For which reason the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> call that day Antiphraxis (or disjunction) and utterly abominate the very number. For the middle number seventeen, falling in betwixt the square number sixteen and the oblong parallelogram eighteen (which are the only plane numbers that have their peripheries equal with their areas), disjoins and separates them from each other; and being divided into unequal portions, it makes the sesquioctave proportion (9: 8). Moreover, there are some that affirm <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> to have lived eight and twenty years; and others again, that he only reigned so long, for that is the just number of the moon's degrees of light and of the days wherein she performs her circuit. And after they have cleft the tree, at the solemnity they call <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>'s Burial, they next form it into an ark in fashion like a crescent, because the moon, when it joins the sun, becomes first of that figure and then vanishes away.

But that which touches upon both these, and is called the horizon (or bounding circle) and is common to them both, is called <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>, and resembles in shape the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, because the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> makes use of his sight by night as well as by day. And therefore <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a> seems to me to have a power among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> much like to that of <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> among the Grecians, he being as well terrestrial as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a>. Some again think <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a> to be <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Kronos</a>; wherefore, they say, because he produces all things out of himself and breeds them in himself, he had the name of <a href=/people/9645 target=_blank>Kyon</a> (which signifies in Greek both a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> and a breeder) Moreover, those that worship the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> have a certain secret meaning that must not be here revealed.

For it is not drought, nor wind, nor sea, nor darkness, but every part of Nature that is hurtful or destructive, that belongs to <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>. For we are not to place the first origins of the universe in inanimate bodies, as do <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a> and <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a>; nor to make one reason, and one forecast overruling and containing all things, the creator of matter without attribute, as the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> do; for it is alike impossible for any thing bad to exist where God is the cause of all things, and for any thing good to exist where he is the cause of nothing. For the harmony of the world is (according to <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a>) like that of a bow or a harp, alternately tightened and relaxed; and according to <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, Nor good nor bad here's to be found apart; But both immixed in one, for greater art. And therefore this most ancient opinion hath been handed down from the theologists and law-givers to the poets and philosophers, it having an original fathered upon none, but having gained a persuasion both strong and indelible, and being everywhere professed and received by barbarians as well as Grecians, — and that not only in vulgar discourses and public fame, but also in their secret mysteries and open sacrifices, — that the world is neither hurried about by wild chance without intelligence, discourse, and direction, nor yet that there is but one reason, which as it were with a rudder or with gentle and easy reins directs it and holds it in; but that on the contrary, there are in it several differing things, and those made up of bad as well as good; or rather (to speak more plainly) that Nature produces nothing here but what is mixed and tempered. Not that there is as it were one store-keeper, who out of two different casks dispenses to us human affairs adulterated and mixed together, as a host doth his liquors; but by reason of two contrary origins and opposite powers — whereof the one leads to the right hand and in a direct line, and the other turns to the contrary hand and goes athwart — both human life is mixed, and the world (if not all, yet that part which is about the earth and below the moon) is become very unequal and various, and liable to all manner of changes. For if nothing can come without a cause, and if a good thing cannot afford a cause of evil, Nature then must certainly have a peculiar source and origin of evil as well as of good. </p>                        </div>

But the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldaeans</a> say, there are Gods of the planets also, two whereof they style benefics, and two malefics; the other three they pronounce to be common and indifferent. As for the Grecians, their opinions are obvious and well known to every one; to wit, that they make the good part of the world to appertain to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, and the hateful part to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Pluto</a>; and likewise, that they fable <a href=/people/443 target=_blank>Harmonia</a> to have been begotten by <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, the one whereof is rough and quarrelsome, and the other sweet and generative. In the next place consider we the great agreement of the philosophers with these people. For <a href=/people/491 target=_blank>Heraclitus</a> doth in plain and naked terms call war the father, the king, and the lord of all things; and saith that <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, when he first prayed, Discord be damned from Gods and human race, little thought he was then cursing the origination of all things, they owing their rise to aversation and quarrel. He also saith, that the sun will never exceed his proper bounds; and if he should, that Tongues, aids of justice, soon will find him out. <a href=/people/227 target=_blank>Empedocles</a> also calls the benefic principle love and friendship, and very often sweet-looked harmony; and the evil principle Pernicious enmity and bloody hate. The <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> use a great number of terms as attributes of these two principles; of the good, they use the unit, the terminate, the permanent, the straight, the odd, the square, the equal, the dexter, and the lucid; and again of the bad, the two, the interminate, the fluent, the crooked, the even, the oblong, the unequal, the sinister, and the dark; insomuch that all these are looked upon as principles of generation. But <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> made but two, the intelligence and the interminate; and <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> called the first of these form, and the latter privation. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> in many places, as it were shading and veiling over his opinion, names the first of these opposite principles the Same, and the second the Other. But in his book of Laws, when he was now grown old, he affirmed, not in riddles and emblems but in plain and proper words, that the world is not moved by one soul, but perhaps by a great many, but not by fewer than two; the one of which is beneficent, and the other contrary to it and the author of things contrary. He also leaves a certain third nature in the midst between, which is neither without soul nor without reason, nor void of a self-moving power (as some suppose), but rests upon both of the preceding principles, but yet so as still to affect, desire, and pursue the better of them; as I shall make out in the ensuing part of this discourse, in which I design to reconcile the theology of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> principally with this sort of philosophy. </p>                        </div>

They also oftentimes describe this God by a hawk, because he exceeds in quickness of sight and velocity in flying, and sustains himself with very little food. He is also said to fly over the bodies of dead men that lie unburied, and to drop down earth upon their eyes. Likewise, when he alights down upon the bank of any river to assuage his thirst, he sets his feathers up on end, and after he hath done drinking, he lets them fall again.

(What each of these means, I shall after wards explain.) Now they are of opinion that the sun is atoned and pacified by all these. But to what purpose should I heap together many things of this nature? For there are some that scruple not to say plainly that <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> is the sun, and that he is called Sirius by the Greeks, although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, adding the article to his name, have obscured and brought its sense into question. They also declare <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> to be no other than the moon, and say that such statues of her as are horned were made in imitation of the crescent; and that the black habit in which she so passionately pursues the sun, sets forth her disappearings and eclipses. For which reason they used to invoke the moon in love-concerns; and <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> also saith that <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> presides over love-matters. Now these things have in them a show and semblance of reason; whereas they that would make <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> to be the sun deserve not to be heard. </p>                        </div>

And one would conjecture that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> called it the most perfect of triangles, because they likened the nature of the universe principally to that; which <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also in his Commonwealth seems to have made use of to the same purpose, when he forms his nuptial diagram. Now in that triangle the perpendicular consists of three parts, the base of four, and the subtense of five, its square being equal in value with the squares of the two that contain it. We are therefore to take the perpendicular to represent the male property, the base the female, and the subtense that which is produced by them both.

The number five also in some respects resembles the father and in some again the mother, being made up of three and two; besides, πάντα (all things) seems to be derived from πεντε (five) and they use πεμπάσασθαι (which is telling five) for counting.

For this same Plenty is no other than the first amiable, desirable, complete, and sufficient being; and matter is that which he called <a href=/people/1896 target=_blank>Poverty</a>, she being of herself alone destitute of the property of good, but when she is impregnated by it, she still desires and craves for more. Moreover, the world (or <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a>) that is produced out of these two, being not eternal, nor impassible, nor incorruptible, but ever a making, does therefore machinate, partly by shifting of accidents and partly by circular motions, to remain still young and never to die. </p>                        </div>

For as iron is oftentimes like a thing that is drawn to and follows the loadstone, and oftentimes again flies off and recoils to the opposite part; so the salutary, good, and intelligent motion of the universe doth, as by a gentle persuasion, invert, reduce, and make softer the rugged and Typhonian one; and when again it is restrained and forced back, it returns into itself, and sinks into its former interminateness. <a href=/people/670 target=_blank>Eudoxus</a> also saith that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> fable of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is this, that being once unable to go because his legs grew together, he for very shame spent all his time in the wilderness; but that <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> dividing and separating these parts of his body, he came to have the right use of his feet.

Moreover, as the sistrum hath its upper part convex, so its circumference contains the four things that are shaken; for that part of the world also which is liable to generation and corruption is contained by the sphere of the moon, but all things are moved and changed in it by means of the four elements, fire, earth, water, and air. And upon the upper part of the circumference of the sistrum, on the outside, they set the effigies of a <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a> carved with a human face; and again, on the under part, below the four jingling things, they set on one side the face of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, and on the other the face of <a href=/people/3054 target=_blank>Nephthys</a>; symbolically representing by these two faces generation and death (for these are changes and alterations of the elements), and by the <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a> representing the moon, because of the different colors, the night-motion and the great fecundity of this animal.

Others say again, that the kings of after times did, for the greater terror of their enemies, wear about them in their battles the golden and silver heads and upper parts of fierce animals.

For the various animals which he commanded different cities to observe and reverence being at enmity and war with one another, and desiring one another for food, each party among them being upon the perpetual defence of their proper animals, and highly resenting the wrongs that were offered them, it happened that, being thus drawn into the quarrels of their beasts, they were, before they were aware, engaged in hostilities with one another.

And therefore, when they would pacify him and speak him fair, they make their court and addresses to these animals. But if there chance to happen a great and excessive drought which, above what is ordinary at other times, brings along with it either wasting diseases or other monstrous and prodigious calamities, the priests then conduct into a dark place, with great silence and stillness, some of the animals which are honored by them; and they first of all menace and terrify them, and if the mischief still continues, they then consecrate and offer them up, looking upon this as a way of punishing the evil God, or at least as some grand purgation in time of greatest disasters. For, as <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a> relateth, they were used in ancient times to burn live men in the city of <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Ilithyia</a>, entitling them Typhonian; and then they made wind, and dispersed and scattered their ashes into the air.

Besides, they say he is the only animal that lives in water that hath his eye-sight covered over with a thin and transparent film, descending down from his forehead, so that he sees without being seen himself by others, in which he agrees with the first God. Moreover, in what place soever in the country the female crocodile lays her eggs, that may be certainly concluded to be the utmost extent of the rise of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> for that year.

And they lay sixty in all, and are just as many days a hatching them, and the longest lived of them live as many years; that being the first measure which those that are employed about the heavens make use of.

For example, there was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a> an image of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> having no ears, for he that is commander and chief over all should hear no one. <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a> also set a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> by the image of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, and a tortoise by that of <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a>, to show that maids needed a guard upon them, and that silence and keeping at home became married women.

The <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> also honored numbers and geometric figures with the names of Gods. For they called an equilateral triangle <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> Coryphagenes (or crownborn) and <a href=/people/1857 target=_blank>Tritogeneia</a>, because it is equally divided by perpendiculars drawn from the three angles. They likewise called the unit <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>; the number two, contention and also audaciousness; and the number three, justice; for, wronging and being wronged being two extremes caused by deficiency and excess, justice came by equality in the middle.

We are not therefore to content ourselves with worshipping these things, but we must worship God through them, — as being the more clear mirrors of him, and produced by Nature, — so as ever worthily to conceive of them as the instruments or artifices of that God which orders all things. And it is reasonable to believe that no inanimate being can be more excellent than an animate one, nor an insensible than a sensible; no, though one should heap together all the gold and emeralds in the universe. For the property of the Divinity consists not in fine colors, shapes, and slicknesses; but, on the contrary, those natures are of a rank below the very dead, that neither did nor ever can partake of life.

Whereas, therefore, the air that we most use and live in hath not always the same disposition and temperament, but in the night-time grows condense, compresses the body, and contracts the mind into a kind of melancholy and thoughtful habit, it becoming then as it were foggy and dozed, they therefore, as soon as they are up in the morning, burn rosin about them, refreshing and clearing the air by its scattered particles, and fanning up the native spirit of the body, which is now grown languid and dull; this sort of scent having something in it that is very impetuous and striking. And perceiving again at noon-time that the sun hath drawn up by violence a copious and gross exhalation out of the earth, they by censing mix myrrh also with the air; for heat dissolves and dissipates that puddled and slimy vapor which at that time gathers together in the ambient air. And physicians are also found to help pestilential diseases by making great blazes to rarefy the air; but it would be much better rarefied, if they would burn sweet-scented woods, such as cypress, juniper, and pine. And therefore <a href=/people/3520 target=_blank>Acron</a> the physician is said to have gained a mighty reputation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in the time of the great <a href=/people/12337 target=_blank>plague</a>, by ordering people to make fires near to the sick; for not a few were benefited by it. <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> likewise saith that the odoriferous exhalations of perfumes, flowers, and sweet meadows are no less conducing to health than to pleasure; for that their warmth and delicacy of motion gently relax the brain, which is of its own nature cold and clammy. And if it be true that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> in their language call myrrh bal, and that the most proper signification of that word is scattering away idle talk, this also adds some testimony to our account of the reason why they burn it. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg089:81'><b>&sect; 81</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, that they call <a href=/people/6581 target=_blank>Kyphi</a> is a kind of a composition made up of sixteen ingredients, that is, of honey, wine, raisins, cyperus, rosin, myrrh, aspalathus, seseli, mastich, bitumen, nightshade, and dock; to which they add the berries of both the junipers (the one whereof they call the greater, and the other the lesser sort), as also calamus and cardamom. Neither do they put them together slightly or at a random rate; but the sacred books are read to the perfumers all the while they are compounding them. As for the number of the ingredients (sixteen), — although it may appear important, being the square of a square, and making the only square surface which has a periphery equal to its area, — yet I must needs say that this contributes but very little here. But it is the contained species (most of which are of aromatic properties) that send up a sweet fume and an agreeable exhalation, by which the air is changed; and the body, being moved by the breath, sinks into a calm and gentle sleep, and retains a temperament conducive to sleep; and without the disorders of drunkenness, as it were, it loosens and unties, like a sort of knots, the doziness and intenseness of the thoughts by day-time; and the fantastic part and that which is receptive of dreams it wipes like a mirror and renders clearer, with no less efficacy than those strokes of the harp which the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> made use of before they went to sleep, to charm and allay the distempered and irrational part of the soul. For we find that strong scents many times call back the failing sense, but sometimes dull and obstruct it, their wasted parts diffusing themselves by their great fineness and subtilty through the whole body; like as some physicians tell us that sleep is produced when the fumes of meat, by creeping gently about the inwards, and as it were groping every part, cause a certain soft titillation. They also use this <a href=/people/6581 target=_blank>Kyphi</a> both for a drink and for a medicinal potion; for when drunk it is found to cleanse the inwards, it being a loosener of the belly. Besides all this, rosin is the creature of the sun, and they gather myrrh as the trees weep it out by moonlight; but now of those ingredients that make up <a href=/people/6581 target=_blank>Kyphi</a>, there are some that delight more in the night, as those whose nature it is to be nourished by cool blasts, shades, dews, and humidities. For the light of day is one thing and simple; and <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a> saith, the sun is then seen Through solitary air. But the air of night is a kind of composition; for it is made up of many lights and powers, which, like so many several seeds, flow down from every star into one place. They therefore very pertinently cense the former things by daytime, as being simples and deriving their original from the sun; and the latter at the entrance of the night, they being mixed and of many and different qualities. </p>                        </div>
