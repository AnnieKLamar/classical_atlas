If a man has devoted his whole spirit to excellence, sparing neither expense nor toils, it is right to grant the boast of manliness to those who achieve excellence, with an ungrudging [45] mind. For it is an easy gift for a skilled man to speak words of praise in recompense for labors of all kinds and thus to promote the common good. Different wages for different deeds are sweet to men, to the shepherd and the ploughman and the bird-trapper, and the man whom the sea nourishes.

[30] But the immortal minds of the gods did not accomplish that marriage for them, when they heard the divine prophecies. Wise <a href=/people/554 target=_blank>Themis</a> spoke in their midst and said that it was fated that the sea-goddess should bear a princely son, stronger than his father, who would wield another weapon in his hand more powerful than the thunderbolt [35] or the irresistible trident, if she lay with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> or one of his brothers.

On the evening of the full moon [45] let her loosen the lovely bridle of her virginity for that hero. So the goddess spoke, addressing the sons of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a>, and they nodded assent with their immortal brows. The fruit of her words did not perish, for they say that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> shared the common concern even for the marriage of <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a>.

He is not dishonored by the offspring of his father's distinguished brother. Therefore let another young man weave for <a href=/people/7508 target=_blank>Cleandros</a> a garland of tender myrtle in honor of the pancratium, since the contest of <a href=/people/1411 target=_blank>Alcathous</a> and the young men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376232PEpi class=place long=23.1602 lat=37.6335>Epidaurus</a> welcomed him before in his success.
