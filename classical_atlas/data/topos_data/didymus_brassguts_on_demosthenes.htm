It goes as follows: <br /><a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a>, laborious for the mortal race to attain. <br />The noblest object of life's hunt; <br />For your beautiful form, O virgin, <br />To die is a fate sought after in Greece <br />And to endure fierce, unwearied labours. <br />Such is the fruit, quite divine, that you <br />Cast upon the mind, (a fruit) better than gold. <br />Than parents, than languid-eyed sleep. <br />For your sake the godlike <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Herakles</a> and the sons of <a href=/people/596 target=_blank>Leda</a><br />Endured much in (their) labours, <br />As they pursued the prize of your power, <br />And out of yearning for you <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Akhilleus</a><br />And <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Aias</a> went to the halls of <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a>. <br />And it was for the sake of your beloved beauty that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391269PAta class=place long=26.9211 lat=39.0916>Atarneus</a>' <br />Offspring forsook the rays of the sun. <br />Wherefore, the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, daughters of <a href=/people/767 target=_blank>Memory</a>, <br />Shall exalt his memory in song <br />For his accomplishments, and make him immortal. <br />As they exalt the majesty of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, god of hospitalitv. <br />And the honour of lasting friendship. <br />[And] <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> is said to have dedicated [a memorial to <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, which indeed is situated [... and] himself inscribed: This man once in unholy transgression of the sacred law of the blessed ones <br />Was killed by the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> who carry the bow. <br />Not overcoming him in deadly contest of spear out in the open, <br />But employing the trust of a devious man. <br />Against him Bryon, in his On <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theokritos</a>, says that <a href=/people/759 target=_blank>Theokritos</a> [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=demonym long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chian</a>] composed [the following] epigram: Of <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a> the eunuch and slave of <a href=/people/392 target=_blank>Euboulos</a> this <br />Empty tomb was set up by the empty-headed <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, <br />A man, who out of respect for the lawless nature of his stomach, chose to dwell <br />At the mouth of 'borboros' instead of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>. <br />And yet people still disagree about both his capture and his death. For <a href=/people/446 target=_blank>Hermippos</a> in (book) two of his On <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> says (that) he died in imprisonment. But some (say that), after he had been tortured by the King, he was crucified, just as was described previously. Yet others {say that) ... having confessed to none of the plans he had made with <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, just as <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Kallisthenes</a> (says). Yet again, some say that he was captured at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390268UKat class=place long=26.825 lat=38.975>Katane</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390271RAio class=place long=27.1 lat=39>Aiolis</a>, others (say that it was) somewhere else. But it would seem (that) [the issues] concerning <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a> have been laid out [...] by <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> in the sixth (book) of his histories On <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the quotation of which I pass by, [for] (it is) not useful. The barbarian and common enemy of mankind, and all that sort of thing. He includes these examples specifically in his narrative, alleging that on the grounds that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> make such statements against the barbarian on each and every occasion.

And he says that the King both restored the city's fortunes on some previous occasion and now, recently, he made a display of generosity towards it, but that the city voted to reject what was being offered. [By the] previous restoration some say he means the peace that came down in the time of <a href=/people/914 target=_blank>Antalkidas</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Lakonian</a>, incorrectly, at least as it seems to me. For, not only [did] the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> not accept that peace, but entirely the opposite, they also rejected [what was being offered] to them, for the reason <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a> recounts in these very words, after the heading 'the archon (was) <a href=/people/723 target=_blank>Philokles</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377240DAna class=person long=23.9508 lat=37.7273>Anaphlystos</a>': 'And the King sent down the peace in the time of <a href=/people/914 target=_blank>Antalkidas</a>, 'which was not accepted by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, because there had been written in it that the Greeks who were inhabiting Asia were all to be accounted members in the King's household. Furthermore, they banished the ambassadors, who gave their consent in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimon</a>, on the motion of <a href=/people/659 target=_blank>Kallistratos</a>; and <a href=/people/799 target=_blank>Epikrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381238DKep class=person long=23.8206 lat=38.0851>Kephisia</a>, <a href=/people/998 target=_blank>Andokides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKyd class=person long=23.7306 lat=37.974>Kydathenaion</a>, <a href=/people/411 target=_blank>Kratinos</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238DSph class=person long=23.834 lat=37.905>Sphettos</a>, and <a href=/people/2877 target=_blank>Euboulides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=person long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a> did not even await the judgement/trial.' Therefore, it has been seen that it is not likely that <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> was reminding them of this peace, but of some other benefaction and [perhaps of the one] involving <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Konon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheos</a>, on account of the fact that] it was by using the (armaments provided by <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazos</a> that this man overwhelmed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> in the naval engagement near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=place long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Knidos</a>. <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a> will confirm these events as well, for after the heading 'the archon (was) <a href=/people/10303 target=_blank>Souniades</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381237DAch class=person long=23.7332 lat=38.0803>Akharnai</a>', he writes [as follows 'in his fifth book]:'<a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Konon</a>... from Kypros with [.. .<a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazos</a> the] satrap of [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> [...] the fleet [...] [...] he sailed [...] of 40 ships [...] of [the] gulf [. ..] he brought up/approached from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> ...

As a result of this sea battle <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Konon</a> also restored the [Long] Walls for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, against the will of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a>, as the same writer records once again. And I think that there is an argument, even very persuasive, that this is the act of generosity of the King towards the city that the orator is mentioning. For, indeed, his saying 'even though in the past he helped in putting the city's affairs back in order' is somewhat in accord with the opinion that <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Konon</a> defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lakedaimonians</a> at sea by availing himself of <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazos</a>' armament. But <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> could in this instance be making mention of another peace initiated by the King, one which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were glad to agree to. <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a> has discoursed about this peace also, (saying) that they agreed to it, (though it was) very similar to that of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=37.001>Lakonian</a>, <a href=/people/914 target=_blank>Antalkidas</a>, because they were exhausted by the cost of maintaining mercenary troops and were worn out from the war (being) very long. At this time, too, they set up the altar of <a href=/people/280 target=_blank>Eirene</a>. One could produce many other examples also of the King's benefaction towards the city, as, for example, the peace that was put to the vote on the motion of <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Kallias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/919 target=_blank>Hipponikos</a>, and contributions of cash at both the private and public level to the city, of which <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> was perhaps reminding them on this occasion in a summary fashion. </p>                        </div>

Well now, five years before this, in the archonship of Lykiskos, when <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> sent (an embassy) to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> concerning peace, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> also gave audience to the ambassadors of the King, but their verbal exchange with them was more arrogant than it should have been. For they said (that) they would live at peace with him, prodded he did not attack the Hellenic cities. 'These matters are recounted by <a href=/people/534 target=_blank>Androtion</a>, who also [...] <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a>. But it would be better to add [the words] of <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a>, for, after the heading 'The archon (was) Lykiskos,' he goes on: 'In this man's archonship. when the King sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and was asking that his ancestral friendship continue to exist, reply was made [to his] ambassadors at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> that the King would continue to have friendship, so long as he not attack [the] Hellenic cities.' Clearly in these (negotiations) the proposals sent down by the King were peaceful and generous, while the reaction of the People (was) quite the reverse, excessively heavy-handed and abrasive. One could guess the King's munificence towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> people was generated by his suspicion about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a>, against whom he was about to initiate [hostilities] as a result of learning from <a href=/people/580 target=_blank>Hermias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391269PAta class=person long=26.9211 lat=39.0916>Atarneus</a> about that man's preparations for hostilities against himself. 'Then there is something else as well, that is being assaulted by unjust slander and unbecoming language, (and in this way) is harming the state, (and) furthermore is providing an excuse for those, who are unwilling to perform any of their just obligations under the constitution. Moreover, you will find that this is the reason put forward for every failure (to perform) what is required to be done by any one.' [. . . the] theoric fund is being alluded to cryptically [...] he says slanders are being spoken by/against the men who [...] are doing. 'There was a time for us when the income to the state was no more than one hundred and thirty talents; yet there is no one of those capable of undertaking the trierarchy nor of paying the eisphora, who thought it right not to do the duties that concerned him because there was no surplus revenue.' It could be that this occasion was when they were humbled after the defeat near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403266UAig class=place long=26.611 lat=40.35>Aigospotamoi</a> and the people were reduced to short commons, since (their) foreign revenue had been cut off. This will clarify [[A space of about ten lines is left uninscribed on the papyrus]] 'Subsequently, when fortune prospered, the public revenue became large and the income was four hundred talents instead of one, without any of the propertied class suffering any loss.' Concerning the fact that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> had revenues of four hundred talents in <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s time there is also the testimony of <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompos</a> in the twenty-seventh (book) of his On <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, where <a href=/people/979 target=_blank>Aristophon</a>, the demagogue, is introduced speaking the following: </p>                        </div>

Otherwise, you'll become <a href=/people/1012 target=_blank>Prokne</a>, scratching your head, if you lose (them).-a frigid (joke) but, by the Gods, be patient And do not hiss. <br />Speech 11 <br />'So, men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, that <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> did not make peace with us, but (just) put off the war, has now become clear to you all.' The circumstances of the speech are perfectly clear. For hitherto <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>' speeches were concerned with the fact that <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> was intending to plot against the Greeks by disturbing the peace and transgressing the oaths, but now, since the war had obviously already broken out, he says (that) [he sees] what more noble course of action they should take against him, since he has openly reported in his letter his war against them. At any rate, at the end of his letter he says: Since (it is) you, therefore, (who) are taking the initiative and are more aggressive as a result of my caution, and are all the time to the best of your ability exerting yourselves to the end that you [might] take me by war, your former [. . .], with justice I shall defend myself [...], marshalling my forces against (you).' And [...] of his counsel (is) as follows: 'So, men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, that <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> did not make peace with us, but (just) put off the war, has now become clear to you all.'

These cities he was anxious to bring back to his side for two reasons: both to deprive the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> of their grain supply and so that they might not have coastal cities that were providing bases for their fleet and places of refuge for the war against him; and at that time, indeed, he committed [his] greatest transgression by seizing the merchants' ships that were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a>. According to <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a> (they were) two hundred and thirty (ships), while <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompos</a> (says) one hundred and eighty, and from these he amassed seven hundred talents. (That) these actions were perpetrated the year before in the archonship of <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastos</a>, the archon after <a href=/people/562 target=_blank>Nikomakhos</a>, as others say and, in particular, <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philokhoros</a>, who says the following: 'And <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Khares</a> sailed away to a meeting of the King's generals, leaving behind warships at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a> for the purpose of gathering together the cargo ships from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontos</a>. And <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, when he perceived that <a href=/people/462 target=_blank>Khares</a> was absent, at first attempted to send his warships to seize the boats, but, being unable to capture (them), transported soldiers over to the other side against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291SHie class=place long=29.094 lat=41.179>Hieron</a> and gained control of the cargo boats. </p>                        </div>

For the word about the bum [...], as 'people with sweaty bums.' <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>: 'When I recognized (him), I broke into a sweat, and my eyes filled with tears.' And the comic playwright <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> in Frogs, at the expense of the cowering <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>: 'And my arse has been exuding moisture for a long time.' 'And he is suspected by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> for retaining <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388226PNik class=place long=22.5971 lat=38.8048>Nikaia</a> with a garrison and for having wormed his way into the <a href=/people/371 target=_blank>Amphiktyony</a>.' <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388226PNik class=place long=22.5971 lat=38.8048>Nikaia</a> is a coastal city, twenty stades distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe class=place long=22.536 lat=38.795>Thermopylai</a>.

And there are other Nikaias also, but I do not think it necessary to speak about them at this point. Furthermore, if one of the rank and file makes a mistake, he receives a punishment that accords with his crime, but, in the case of these men, it is at the moment when they are most successful that they are treated with the most contemptuous (skorakizein) and insulting language.'

Now, as for the story concerning the flute players, that is agreed upon even by <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>: that, as <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was celebrating a music festival a little before this misfortune, it happened that fatefully all (the flute players) played a <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Kyklops</a> (one-eyed) piece; Antigeneides the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Kyklops</a> of <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenos</a>, Khrysogonos that of <a href=/people/695 target=_blank>Stesikhoros</a>, and <a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheos</a> that of Oiniades.

Why? Because he mentions what the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> did to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> regarding the sacred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>. This happened in the archonship of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodoros</a> (350/49) as <a href=/people/453 target=_blank>Philochoros</a> recounts, writing: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, when they were quarreling with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> over the delimitation of the sacred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>, went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> with <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a> as general and marked the limits of the sacred <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>. The delimiters, with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>' consent, were <a href=/people/9655 target=_blank>Lakrateides</a> the Hierophant and <a href=/people/9511 target=_blank>Hierokleides</a> the Daidouchos (torchbearer) and they dedicated the border areas around the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>, based on the god's oracle that it was preferable and better to leave them and not to work them, and they marked off the border in a ring with stone markers (stelai) in accordance with the decree of <a href=/people/377 target=_blank>Philokrates</a>. In view of this the speech should have been written after this archon, since it has an exhortation to get things ready for war, if it should happen. </p>                        </div>

Still, about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a> a brief declaration.So any locality with trees is commonly called an orgas, such as a grove (alsos), the name stemming from the verb to quicken (οργαν) and some impetus toward sprouting green shoots, for thus they used to use the verb οργαν for a thing having impetus to readiness for something, just as in daily life we say that the clay quickens in preparing ointments. <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> in his Shepherds says He was mixing as to quicken good clay. And <a href=/people/174 target=_blank>Aeschylus</a>, over the dead bodies in front of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Kadmeia</a> when they are ready for the tomb, writes the matter quickens, already rotting was the corpse. They used to call orgades αλματα and αλση (groves of trees, but also leaps) from their shooting up in length. Here was the Troon alma and the grave mounds of Mounippos. Suchlike is <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s expression He shot up like a sapling. Hence the word creeper/shoot (ὅρπηξ) is made from to creep (ἕρπειν). So much for the more common use of orgas. <a href=/people/8069 target=_blank>Orgas</a> is used as a proper name, particularly among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, in the same way that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda class=place long=26.8423 lat=39.6922>Ida</a> is the one in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a> and a wooded locality, and again <a href=/people/10754 target=_blank>Aigialos</a> is both Eion and the country called that, and Akte is part of Attica and also any seaside locality, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383218LRhi class=place long=21.782 lat=38.31>Rhion</a> both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384218PMol class=place long=21.749 lat=38.385>Molykreion</a> and now commonly any mountain summit, and other similar cases. And the account now is what is in <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> about the Megarian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>, which <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Kallimachos</a> mentions as follows: garlic head from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380234UNis class=demonym long=23.364 lat=37.9764>Nisaian</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>. <a href=/people/534 target=_blank>Androtion</a> also discourses on this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a> in the seventh book of his <a href=/people/940 target=_blank>Atthis</a>, writing: And the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> delimited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a> toward <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a> for the Two Goddesses as they wished.

And they remained as they were delimited. And they dedicated whatever fringes adjoined the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a>, having consulted the oracle, with the god ruling it was preferable and better not to work them. And they defined it with stone markers in a ring, with <a href=/people/377 target=_blank>Philokrates</a> proposing: 'What you voted against the accursed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a> when they were cutting off the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381234RSOr class=place long=23.3853 lat=38.0918>Orgas</a> for themselves, to go out, to block them, to not allow it.'
