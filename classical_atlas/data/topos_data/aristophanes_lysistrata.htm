One is busy pottering about her husband; another is getting the servant up; a third is putting her child asleep, or washing the brat or feeding it. <br />LYSISTRATA: But I tell you, the business that calls them here is far and away more urgent. <br />CALONICE: And why do you summon us, dear <a href=/people/2005 target=_blank>Lysistrata</a>?

Oh! oh! (She calls for help.) <br />CHORUS OF WOMEN: What is this I see, ye wretched old men?

The whole thing, my friends, is nothing else but an attempt to re-establish Tyranny.

I have useful counsel to give our city, which deserves it well at my hands for the brilliant distinctions it has lavished on my girlhood. At seven years of age, I was bearer of the sacred vessels; at ten, I pounded barley for the altar of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a>; next, clad in a robe of yellow silk, I was little bear to <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a> at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379240SBra class=place long=23.9937 lat=37.9262>Brauronia</a>; presently, grown a tall, handsome maiden, they put a necklace of dried figs about my neck, and I was Basket-Bearer.

What matters that I was born a woman, if I can cure your misfortunes? I pay my share of tolls and taxes, by giving men to the State.

You pay nothing at all in return; and into the bargain you endanger our lives and liberties by your mistakes. Have you one word to say for yourselves? ... Ah! don't irritate me, you there, or I'll lay my slipper across your jaws; and it's pretty heavy. <br />CHORUS OF OLD MEN: Outrage upon outrage! things are going from bad to worse. Let us punish the minxes, every one of us that has a man's appendages to boast of. Come, off with our tunics, for a man must savour of manhood; come, my friends, let us strip naked from head to foot.
