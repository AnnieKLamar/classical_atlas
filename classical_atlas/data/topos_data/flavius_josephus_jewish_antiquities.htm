                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001:1.pr'><b>&sect; 1.pr</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to Book I <br />Those who undertake to write histories, do not, I perceive, take that trouble on one and the same account, but for many reasons, and those such as are very different one from another. For some of them apply themselves to this part of learning to show their skill in composition, and that they may therein acquire a reputation for speaking finely: others of them there are, who write histories in order to gratify those that happen to be concerned in them, and on that account have spared no pains, but rather gone beyond their own abilities in the performance: but others there are, who, of necessity and by force, are driven to write history, because they are concerned in the facts, and so cannot excuse themselves from committing them to writing, for the advantage of posterity; nay, there are not a few who are induced to draw their historical facts out of darkness into light, and to produce them for the benefit of the public, on account of the great importance of the facts themselves with which they have been concerned. Now of these several reasons for writing history, I must profess the two last were my own reasons also; for since I was myself interested in that war which we <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had with the Romans, and knew myself its particular actions, and what conclusion it had, I was forced to give the history of it, because I saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings. <br />[5] Now I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to all the Greeks worthy of their study; for it will contain all our antiquities, and the constitution of our government, as interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures. And indeed I did formerly intend, when I wrote of the war, to explain who the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> originally were, — what fortunes they had been subject to, — and by what legislature they had been instructed in piety, and the exercise of other virtues, — what wars also they had made in remote ages, till they were unwillingly engaged in this last with the Romans: but because this work would take up a great compass, I separated it into a set treatise by itself, with a beginning of its own, and its own conclusion; but in process of time, as usually happens to such as undertake great things, I grew weary and went on slowly, it being a large subject, and a difficult thing to translate our history into a foreign, and to us unaccustomed language. However, some persons there were who desired to know our history, and so exhorted me to go on with it; and, above all the rest, <a href=/people/2406 target=_blank>Epaphroditus</a>, a man who is a lover of all kind of learning, but is principally delighted with the knowledge of history, and this on account of his having been himself concerned in great affairs, and many turns of fortune, and having shown a wonderful rigor of an excellent nature, and an immovable virtuous resolution in them all. I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always excites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join their endeavors with his. I was also ashamed myself to permit any laziness of disposition to have a greater influence upon me, than the delight of taking pains in such studies as were very useful: I thereupon stirred up myself, and went on with my work more cheerfully. Besides the foregoing motives, I had others which I greatly reflected on; and these were, that our forefathers were willing to communicate such things to others; and that some of the Greeks took considerable pains to know the affairs of our nation. <br />I found, therefore, that the second of the <a href=/people/1790 target=_blank>Ptolemies</a> was a king who was extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning, and the collection of books; that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a translation of our law, and of the constitution of our government therein contained, into the Greek tongue. Now <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a> the high priest, one not inferior to any other of that dignity among us, did not envy the forenamed king the participation of that advantage, which otherwise he would for certain have denied him, but that he knew the custom of our nation was, to hinder nothing of what we esteemed ourselves from being communicated to others. Accordingly, I thought it became me both to imitate the generosity of our high priest, and to suppose there might even now be many lovers of learning like the king; for he did not obtain all our writings at that time; but those who were sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> as interpreters, gave him only the books of the law, while there were a vast number of other matters in our sacred books. They, indeed, contain in them the history of five thousand years; in which time happened many strange accidents, many chances of war, and great actions of the commanders, and mutations of the form of our government. Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God; but then it is to those that follow his will, and do not venture to break his excellent laws: and that so far as men any way apostatize from the accurate observation of them, what was practical before becomes impracticable and whatsoever they set about as a good thing, is converted into an incurable calamity. And now I exhort all those that peruse these books, to apply their minds to God; and to examine the mind of our legislator, whether he hath not understood his nature in a manner worthy of him; and hath not ever ascribed to him such operations as become his power, and hath not preserved his writings from those indecent fables which others have framed, although, by the great distance of time when he lived, he might have securely forged such lies; for he lived two thousand years ago; at which vast distance of ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy as to fix even the generations of their gods, much less the actions of their men, or their own laws. As I proceed, therefore, I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them; for I have already promised so to do throughout this undertaking; and this without adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom. <br />[18] But because almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, our legislator, I cannot avoid saying somewhat concerning him beforehand, though I shall do it briefly; I mean, because otherwise those that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy. The reader is therefore to know, that <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> deemed it exceeding necessary, that he who would conduct his own life well, and give laws to others, in the first place should consider the Divine nature; and, upon the contemplation of God's operations, should thereby imitate the best of all patterns, so far as it is possible for human nature to do, and to endeavor to follow after it: neither could the legislator himself have a right mind without such a contemplation; nor would any thing he should write tend to the promotion of virtue in his readers; I mean, unless they be taught first of all, that God is the Father and Lord of all things, and sees all things, and that thence he bestows a happy life upon those that follow him; but plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable miseries. Now when <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> was desirous to teach this lesson to his countrymen, he did not begin the establishment of his laws after the same manner that other legislators did; I mean, upon contracts and other rights between one man and another, but by raising their minds upwards to regard God, and his creation of the world; and by persuading them, that we men are the most excellent of the creatures of God upon earth. Now when once he had brought them to submit to religion, he easily persuaded them to submit in all other things: for as to other legislators, they followed fables, and by their discourses transferred the most reproachful of human vices unto the gods, and afforded wicked men the most plausible excuses for their crimes; but as for our legislator, when he had once demonstrated that God was possessed of perfect virtue, he supposed that men also ought to strive after the participation of it; and on those who did not so think, and so believe, he inflicted the severest punishments. I exhort, therefore, my readers to examine this whole undertaking in that view; for thereby it will appear to them, that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the majesty of God, or to his love to mankind; for all things have here a reference to the nature of the universe; while our legislator speaks some things wisely, but enigmatically, and others under a decent allegory, but still explains such things as required a direct explication plainly and expressly. However, those that have a mind to know the reasons of every thing, may find here a very curious philosophical theory, which I now indeed shall wave the explication of; but if God afford me time for it, I will set about writing it after I have finished the present work. I shall now betake myself to the history before me, after I have first mentioned what <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> says of the creation of the world, which I find described in the sacred books after the manner following.

Accordingly, when <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> read this, and admired the Divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written; so he called for the most eminent <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and said to them, that he gave them leave to go back to their own country, and to rebuild their city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of God, for that he would be their assistant, and that he would write to the rulers and governors that were in the neighborhood of their country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, that they should contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and besides that, beasts for their sacrifices. </p>                        </div>

So they performed their vows to God, and offered the sacrifices that had been accustomed of old time; I mean this upon the rebuilding of their city, and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their worship. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> also sent back to them the vessels of God which king <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> had pillaged out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and had carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>.

I require also that the expenses for these things may be given out of my revenues. Moreover, I have also sent the vessels which king <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> pillaged out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and have given them to <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> the treasurer, and to <a href=/people/2557 target=_blank>Zorobabel</a> the governor of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, that they may have them carried to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and may restore them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of God. Now their number is as follows: Fifty chargers of gold, and five hundred of silver; forty <a href=/people/4718 target=_blank>Thericlean</a> cups of gold, and five hundred of silver; fifty basins of gold, and five hundred of silver; thirty vessels for pouring [the drink-offerings], and three hundred of silver; thirty vials of gold, and two thousand four hundred of silver; with a thousand other large vessels. I permit them to have the same honor which they were used to have from their forefathers, as also for their small <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and for wine and oil, two hundred and five thousand and five hundred drachme; and for wheat flour, twenty thousand and five hundred artabae; and I give order that these expenses shall be given them out of the tributes due from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>.

He began his demonstration after the following manner; and said, They are men who govern all things; they force the earth and the sea to become profitable to them in what they desire, and over these men do kings rule, and over them they have authority. Now those who rule over that animal which is of all the strongest and most powerful, must needs deserve to be esteemed insuperable in power and force. For example, when these kings command their subjects to make wars, and undergo dangers, they are hearkened to; and when they send them against their enemies, their power is so great that they are obeyed. They command men to level mountains, and to pull down walls and towers; nay, when they are commanded to be killed and to kill, they submit to it, that they may not appear to transgress the king's commands; and when they have conquered, they bring what they have gained in the war to the king. Those also who are not soldiers, but cultivate the ground, and plough it, and when, after they have endured the labor and all the inconveniences of such works of husbandry, they have reaped and gathered in their fruits, they bring tributes to the king; and whatsoever it is which the king says or commands, it is done of necessity, and that without any delay, while he in the mean time is satiated with all sorts of food and pleasures, and sleeps in quiet. He is guarded by such as watch, and such as are, as it were, fixed down to the place through fear; for no one dares leave him, even when he is asleep, nor does any one go away and take care of his own affairs; but he esteems this one thing the only work of necessity, to guard the king, and accordingly to this he wholly addicts himself. How then can it be otherwise, but that it must appear that the king exceeds all in strength, while so great a multitude obeys his injunctions? </p>                        </div>

And when we have gotten a great deal of gold and silver, and any other thing that is of great value, and deserving regard, and see a beautiful woman, we leave all these things, and with open mouth fix our eyes upon her countenance, and are willing to forsake what we have, that we may enjoy her beauty, and procure it to ourselves. We also leave father, and mother, and the earth that nourishes us, and frequently forget our dearest friends, for the sake of women; nay, we are so hardy as to lay down our lives for them. But what will chiefly make you take notice of the strength of women is this that follows: Do not we take pains, and endure a great deal of trouble, and that both by land and sea, and when we have procured somewhat as the fruit of our labors, do not we bring them to the women, as to our mistresses, and bestow them upon them? Nay, I once saw the king, who is lord of so many people, smitten on the face by <a href=/people/5440 target=_blank>Apame</a>, the daughter of Rabsases Themasius, his concubine, and his diadem taken away from him, and put upon her own head, while he bore it patiently; and when she smiled he smiled, and when she was angry he was sad; and according to the change of her passions, he flattered his wife, and drew her to reconciliation by the great humiliation of himself to her, if at my time he saw her displeased at him. </p>                        </div>

So he read the letter at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> to those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were there; but he kept the letter itself, and sent a copy of it to all those of his own nation that were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>. And when these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had understood what piety the king had towards God, and what kindness he had for <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a>, they were all greatly pleased; nay, many of them took their effects with them, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, as very desirous of going down to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; but then the entire body of the people of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> remained in that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, while the ten tribes are beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers. Now there came a great number of priests, and Levites, and porters, and sacred singers, and sacred servants to <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a>. So he gathered those that were in the captivity together beyond <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, and staid there three days, and ordained a fast for them, that they might make their prayers to God for their preservation, that they might suffer no misfortunes by the way, either from their enemies, or from any other ill accident; for <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> had said beforehand that he had told the king how God would preserve them, and so he had not thought fit to request that he would send horsemen to conduct them. So when they had finished their prayers, they removed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> on the twelfth day of the first month of the seventh year of the reign of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, and they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> on the fifth month of the same year. Now <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> presented the sacred money to the treasurers, who were of the family of the priests, of silver six hundred and fifty talents, vessels of silver one hundred talents, vessels of gold twenty talents, vessels of brass, that was more precious than gold, twelve talents by weight; for these Presents had been made by the king and his counselors, and by all the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a> that staid at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>.

But some time afterward there came some persons to him, and brought an accusation against certain of the multitude, and of the priests and Levites, who had transgressed their settlement, and dissolved the laws of their country, by marrying strange wives, and had brought the family of the priests into confusion. These persons desired him to support the laws, lest God should take up a general anger against them all, and reduce them to a calamitous condition again. Hereupon he rent his garment immediately, out of grief, and pulled off the hair of his head and beard, and cast himself upon the ground, because this crime had reached the principal men among the people; and considering that if he should enjoin them to cast out their wives, and the children they had by them, he should not be hearkener to, he continued lying upon the ground. However, all the better sort came running to him, who also themselves wept, and partook of the grief he was under for what had been done. So <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> rose up from the ground, and stretched out his hands towards heaven, and said that he was ashamed to look towards it, because of the sins which the people had committed, while they had cast out of their memories what their fathers had undergone on account of their wickedness; and he besought God, who had saved a seed and a remnant out of the calamity and captivity they had been in, and had restored them again to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and to their own land, and had obliged the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> to have compassion on them, that he would also forgive them their sins they had now committed, which, though they deserved death, yet, was it agreeable to the mercy of God, to remit even to these the punishment due to them. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> hearkened to this advice, and made the heads of the priests, and of the Levites, and of the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a>, swear that they would put away those wives and children, according to the advice of <a href=/people/9599 target=_blank>Jechonias</a>.

And when proclamation was made, that all those of the captivity should gather themselves together to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and those that did not meet there in two or three days should be banished from the multitude, and that their substance should be appropriated to the uses of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, according to the sentence of the elders, those that were of the tribes of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> and Benjamin came together in three days, viz. on the twentieth day of the ninth month, which, according to the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, is called Tebeth, and according to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, <a href=/people/10782 target=_blank>Apellaios</a>. Now as they were sitting in the upper room of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, where the elders also were present, but were uneasy because of the cold, <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> stood up and accused them, and told them that they had sinned in marrying wives that were not of their own nation; but that now they would do a thing both pleasing to God, and advantageous to themselves, if they would put those wives away. Accordingly, they all cried out that they would do so. That, however, the multitude was great, and that the season of the year was winter, and that this work would require more than one or two days. Let their rulers, therefore, [said they,] and those that have married strange wives, come hither at a proper time, while the elders of every place, that are in common to estimate the number of those that have thus married, are to be there also. Accordingly, this was resolved on by them, and they began the inquiry after those that had married strange wives on the first day of the tenth month, and continued the inquiry to the first day of the next month, and found a great many of the posterity of <a href=/people/3192 target=_blank>Jeshua</a> the high priest, and of the priests and Levites, and <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a>, who had a greater regard to the observation of the law than to their natural affection, and immediately cast out their wives, and the children which were born of them. And in order to appease God, they offered sacrifices, and slew rams, as oblations to him; but it does not seem to me to be necessary to set down the names of these men. So when <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> had reformed this sin about the marriages of the forementioned persons, he reduced that practice to purity, so that it continued in that state for the time to come. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he stood in the midst of the multitude and read them; and this he did from morning to noon. Now, by hearing the laws read to them, they were instructed to be righteous men for the present and for the future; but as for their past offenses, they were displeased at themselves, and proceeded to shed tears on their account, as considering with themselves that if they had kept the law, they had endured none of these miseries which they had experienced. But when <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> saw them in that disposition, he bade them go home, and not weep, for that it was a festival, and that they ought not to weep thereon, for that it was not lawful so to do. He exhorted them rather to proceed immediately to feasting, and to do what was suitable to a feast, and what was agreeable to a day of joy; but to let their repentance and sorrow for their former sins be a security and a guard to them, that they fell no more into the like offenses. So upon <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a>'s exhortation they began to feast; and when they had so done for eight days, in their tabernacles, they departed to their own homes, singing hymns to God, and returning thanks to <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> for his reformation of what corruptions had been introduced into their settlement.

As this man was walking before <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus class=place long=48.247 lat=32.191>Susa</a>, the metropolis of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, he heard some strangers that were entering the city, after a long journey, speaking to one another in the Hebrew tongue; so he went to them, and asked them whence they came. And when their answer was, that they came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, he began to inquire of them again in what state the multitude was, and in what condition <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was; and when they replied that they were in a bad state for that their walls were thrown down to the ground, and that the neighboring nations did a great deal of mischief to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, while in the day time they overran the country, and pillaged it, and in the night did them mischief, insomuch that not a few were led away captive out of the country, and out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> itself, and that the roads were in the day time found full of dead men. Hereupon <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> shed tears, out of commiseration of the calamities of his countrymen; and, looking up to heaven, he said, How long, O Lord, wilt thou overlook our nation, while it suffers so great miseries, and while we are made the prey and spoil of all men? And while he staid at the gate, and lamented thus, one told him that the king was going to sit down to supper; so he made haste, and went as he was, without wishing himself, to minister to the king in his office of cup-bearer. But as the king was very pleasant after supper, and more cheerful than usual, he cast his eyes on <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a>, and seeing him look sad, he asked him why he was sad. Whereupon he prayed to God to give him favor, and afford him the power of persuading by his words, and said, How can I, O king, appear otherwise than thus, and not be in trouble, while I hear that the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, the city where are the sepulchers of my fathers, are thrown down to the ground, and that its gates are consumed by fire?

Accordingly, the king gave him a signal that he freely granted him what he asked; and told him that he should carry an letter to the governors, that they might pay him due honor, and afford him whatsoever assistance he wanted, and as he pleased. Leave off thy sorrow then, said the king, and be cheerful in the performance of thy office hereafter. So <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> worshipped God, and gave the king thanks for his promise, and cleared up his sad and cloudy countenance, by the pleasure he had from the king's promises. Accordingly, the king called for him the next day, and gave him an letter to be carried to <a href=/people/8684 target=_blank>Adeus</a>, the governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>; wherein he sent to him to pay due honor to <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a>, and to supply him with what he wanted for his building. </p>                        </div>

When he had said this, he gave order that the rulers should measure the wall, and part the work of it among the people, according to their villages and cities, as every one's ability should require. And when he had added this promise, that he himself, with his servants, would assist them, he dissolved the assembly.

They also slew many of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and sought how they might destroy <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> himself, by hiring some of the foreigners to kill him. They also put the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in fear, and disturbed them, and spread abroad rumors, as if many nations were ready to make an expedition against them, by which means they were harassed, and had almost left off the building. But none of these things could deter <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> from being diligent about the work; he only set a number of men about him as a guard to his body, and so unweariedly persevered therein, and was insensible of any trouble, out of his desire to perfect this work. And thus did he attentively, and with great forecast, take care of his own safety; not that he feared death, but of this persuasion, that if he were dead, the walls for his citizens would never be raised. He also gave orders that the builders should keep their ranks, and have their armor on while they were building. Accordingly, the mason had his sword on, as well as he that brought the materials for building. He also appointed that their shields should lie very near them; and he placed trumpeters at every five hundred feet, and charged them, that if their enemies appeared, they should give notice of it to the people, that they might fight in their armor, and their enemies might not fall upon them naked. He also went about the compass of the city by night, being never discouraged, neither about the work itself, nor about his own diet and sleep, for he made no use of those things for his pleasure, but out of necessity. And this trouble he underwent for two years and four months; for in so long a time was the wall built, in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, in the ninth month. Now when the walls were finished, <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> and the multitude offered sacrifices to God for the building of them, and they continued in feasting eight days. However, when the nations which dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> heard that the building of the wall was finished, they had indignation at it. But when <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> saw that the city was thin of people, he exhorted the priests and the Levites that they would leave the country, and remove themselves to the city, and there continue; and he built them houses at his own expenses; and he commanded that part of the people which were employed in cultivating the land to bring the tithes of their fruits to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, that the priests and Levites having whereof they might live perpetually, might not leave the Divine worship; who willingly hearkened to the constitutions of <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a>, by which means the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> came to be fuller of people than it was before. So when <a href=/people/2638 target=_blank>Nehemiah</a> had done many other excellent things, and things worthy of commendation, in a glorious manner, he came to a great age, and then died. He was a man of a good and righteous disposition, and very ambitious to make his own nation happy; and he hath left the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> as an eternal monument for himself.

Now this feast was ordered after the manner following: He caused a tent to be pitched, which was supported by pillars of gold and silver, with curtains of linen and purple spread over them, that it might afford room for many ten thousands to sit down. The cups with which the waiters ministered were of gold, and adorned with precious stones, for pleasure and for sight. He also gave order to the servants that they should not force them to drink, by bringing them wine continually, as is the practice of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, but to permit every one of the guests to enjoy himself according to his own inclination. Moreover, he sent messengers through the country, and gave order that they should have a remission of their labors, and should keep a festival many days, on account of his kingdom. In like manner did <a href=/people/8480 target=_blank>Vashti</a> the queen gather her guests together, and made them a feast in the palace. Now the king was desirous to show her, who exceeded all other women in beauty, to those that feasted with him, and he sent some to command her to come to his feast. But she, out of regard to the laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, which forbid the wives to be seen by strangers, did not go to the king and though he oftentimes sent the eunuchs to her, she did nevertheless stay away, and refused to come, till the king was so much irritated, that he brake up the entertainment, and rose up, and called for those seven who had the interpretation of the laws committed to them, and accused his wife, and said that he had been affronted by her, because that when she was frequently called by him to his feast, she did not obey him once. He therefore gave order that they should inform him what could be done by the law against her. So one of them, whose name was Memucan, said that this affront was offered not to him alone, but to all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, who were in danger of leading their lives very ill with their wives, if they must be thus despised by them; for that none of their wives would have any reverence for their husbands, if they had such an example of arrogance in the queen towards thee, who rulest over all. Accordingly, he exhorted him to punish her, who had been guilty of so great an affront to him, after a severe manner; and when he had so done, to publish to the nations what had been decreed about the queen. So the resolution was to put <a href=/people/8480 target=_blank>Vashti</a> away, and to give her dignity to another woman. </p>                        </div>

But when his friends saw him so uneasy, they advised him to cast the memory of his wife, and his love for her, out of his mind, but to send abroad over all the habitable earth, and to search out for comely virgins, and to take her whom he should best like for his wife, because his passion for his former wife would be quenched by the introduction of another, and the kindness he had for <a href=/people/8480 target=_blank>Vashti</a> would be withdrawn from her, and be placed on her that was with him. Accordingly, he was persuaded to follow this advice, and gave order to certain persons to choose out of the virgins that were in his kingdom those that were esteemed the most comely. So when a great number of these virgins were gathered together, there was found a damsel in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, whose parents were both dead, and she was brought up with her uncle <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, for that was her uncle's name. This uncle was of the tribe of Benjamin, and was one of the principal persons among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. Now it proved that this damsel, whose name was <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a>, was the most beautiful of all the rest, and that the grace of her countenance drew the eyes of the spectators principally upon her. So she was committed to one of the eunuchs to take the care of her; and she was very exactly provided with sweet odors, in great plenty, and with costly ointments, such as her body required to be anointed withal; and this was used for six months by the virgins, who were in number four hundred. And when the eunuch thought the virgins had been sufficiently purified, in the fore-mentioned time, and were now fit to go to the king's bed, he sent one to be with the king ever day. So when he had accompanied with her, he sent her back to the eunuch; and when <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> had come to him, he was pleased with her, and fell in love with the damsel, and married her, and made her his lawful wife, and kept a wedding feast for her on the twelfth month of the seventh year of his reign, which was called <a href=/people/5401 target=_blank>Adar</a>. He also sent angari, as they are called, or messengers, unto every nation, and gave orders that they should keep a feast for his marriage, while he himself treated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, and the principal men of the nations, for a whole month, on account of this his marriage. Accordingly, <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> came to his royal palace, and he set a diadem on her head.

Accordingly he came to the king, and accused them, saying, There is a certain wicked nation, and it is dispersed over all the habitable earth the was under his dominion; a nation separate from others, unsociable, neither admitting the same sort of Divine worship that others do, nor using laws like to the laws of others, at enmity with thy people, and with all men, both in their manners and practices. Now, if thou wilt be a benefactor to thy subjects, thou wilt give order to destroy them utterly, and not leave the least remains of them, nor preserve any of them, either for slaves or for captives. :But that the king might not be damnified by the loss of the tributes which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> paid him, <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> promised to give him out of his own estate forty thousand talents whensoever he pleased; and he said he would pay this money very willingly, that the kingdom might. be freed from such a misfortune. </p>                        </div>

And he went on saying thus as far as to the king's palace, and there he stood, for it was not lawful for him to go into it in that habit. The same thing was done by all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were in the several cities wherein this decree was published, with lamentation and mourning, on account of the calamities denounced against them. But as soon as certain persons had told the queen that <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> stood before the court in a mourning habit, she was disturbed at this report, and sent out such as should change his garments; but when he could not be induced to put off his sackcloth, because the sad occasion that forced him to put it on was not yet ceased, she called the eunuch Acratheus, for he was then present, and sent him to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, in order to know of him what sad accident had befallen him, for which he was in mourning, and would not put off the habit he had put on at her desire. Then did <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> inform the eunuch of the occasion of his mourning, and of the decree which was sent by the king into all the country, and of the promise of money whereby <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> brought the destruction of their nation. He also gave him a copy of what was proclaimed at <a href=/people/3961 target=_blank>Shushan</a>, to be carried to <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a>; and he charged her to petition the king about this matter, and not to think it a dishonorable thing in her to put on a humble habit, for the safety of her nation, wherein she might deprecate the ruin of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, who were in danger of it; for that <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, whose dignity was only inferior to that of the king, had accused the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and had irritated the king against them. When she was informed of this, she sent to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> again, and told him that she was not called by the king, and that he who goes in to him without being called, is to be slain, unless when he is willing to save any one, he holds out his golden scepter to him; but that to whomsoever he does so, although he go in without being called, that person is so far from being slain, that he obtains pardon, and is entirely preserved. Now when the eunuch carried this message from <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, he bade him also tell her that she must not only provide for her own preservation, but for the common preservation of her nation, for that if she now neglected this opportunity, there would certainly arise help to them from God some other way, but she and her father's house would be destroyed by those whom she now despised. But <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> sent the very same eunuch back to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> [to desire him] to go to <a href=/people/3961 target=_blank>Shushan</a>, and to gather the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were there together to a congregation, and to fast and abstain from all sorts of food, on her account, and [to let him know that] she with her maidens would do the same: and then she promised that she would go to the king, though it were against the law, and that if she must die for it, she would not refuse it. </p>                        </div>

The same supplications did the multitude put up, and entreated that God would provide for their deliverance, and free the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a> that were in all the earth from this calamity which was now coming upon them, for they had it before their eyes, and expected its coming. Accordingly, <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> made supplication to God after the manner of her country, by casting herself down upon the earth, and putting on her mourning garments, and bidding farewell to meat and drink, and all delicacies, for three days' time; and she entreated God to have mercy upon her, and make her words appear persuasive to the king, and render her countenance more beautiful than it was before, that both by her words and beauty she might succeed, for the averting of the king's anger, in case he were at all irritated against her, and for the consolation of those of her own country, now they were in the utmost danger of perishing; as also that he would excite a hatred in the king against the enemies of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and those that had contrived their future destruction, if they proved to be contemned by him. </p>                        </div>

And thus she came to the king, having a blushing redness in her countenance, with a pleasant agreeableness in her behavior; yet did she go in to him with fear; and as soon as she was come over against him, as he was sitting on his throne, in his royal apparel, which was a garment interwoven with gold and precious stones, which made him seem to her more terrible, especially when he looked at her somewhat severely, and with a countenance on fire with anger, her joints failed her immediately, out of the dread she was in, and she fell down sideways in a swoon: but the king changed his mind, which happened, as I suppose, by the will of God, and was concerned for his wife, lest her fear should bring some very ill thing upon her, and he leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, and recovered her, by embracing her, and speaking comfortably to her, and exhorting her to be of good cheer, and not to suspect any thing that was sad on account of her coming to him without being called, because that law was made for subjects, but that she, who was a queen, as well as he a king, might be entirely secure; and as he said this, he put the scepter into her hand, and laid his rod upon her neck, on account of the law; and so freed her from her fear. And after she had recovered herself by these encouragements, she said, My lord, it is not easy for me, on the sudden, to say what hath happened, for as soon as I saw thee to be great, and comely, and terrible, my spirit departed from me, and I had no soul left in me. And while it was with difficulty, and in a low voice, that she could say thus much, the king was in a great agony and disorder, and encouraged <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> to be of good cheer, and to expect better fortune, since he was ready, if occasion should require it, to grant her the half of his kingdom. Accordingly, <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> desired that he and his friend <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> would come to her to a banquet, for she said she had prepared a supper for him.

So he went home and called for his wife Zeresh, and his friends, and when they were come, he showed them what honor he enjoyed not only from the king, but from the queen also, for as he alone had that day supped with her, together with the king, so was he also invited again for the next day; yet, said he, am I not pleased to see <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> in the court. Hereupon his wife Zeresh advised him to give order that a gallows should be made fifty cubits high, and that in the morning he should ask it of the king that <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> might be hanged thereon. So he commended her advice, and gave order to his servants to prepare the gallows, and to place it in the court, for the punishment of <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> thereon, which was accordingly prepared. But God laughed to scorn the wicked expectations of <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>; and as he knew what the event would be, he was delighted at it, for that night he took away the king's sleep; and as the king was not willing to lose the time of his lying awake, but to spend it in something that might be of advantage to his kingdom, he commanded the scribe to bring him the chronicles of the former kings, and the records of his own actions; and when he had brought them, and was reading them, one was found to have received a country on account of his excellent management on a certain occasion, and the name of the country was set down; another was found to have had a present made him on account of his fidelity: then the scribe came to <a href=/people/8996 target=_blank>Bigthan</a> and Teresh, the eunuchs that had made a conspiracy against the king, which <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> had discovered; and when the scribe said no more but that, and was going on to another history, the king stopped him, and inquired whether it was not added that <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> had a reward given him? and when he said there was no such addition, he bade him leave off; and he inquired of those that were appointed for that purpose, what hour of the night it was; and when he was informed that it was already day, he gave order, that if they found any one of his friends already come, and standing before the court, they should tell him. Now it happened that <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> was found there, for he was come sooner than ordinary to petition the king to have <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> put to death; and when the servants said that <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> was before the court, he bid them call him in; and when he was come in, he said, Because I know that thou art my only fast friend, I desire thee to give me advice how I may honor one that I greatly love, and that after a manner suitable to my magnificence. Now <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> reasoned with himself, that what opinion he should give it would be for himself, since it was he alone who was beloved by the king: so he gave that advice which he thought of all other the best; for he said, If thou wouldst truly honor a man whom thou sayest thou dost love, give order that he may ride on horseback, with the same garment on which thou wearest, and with a gold chain about his neck, and let one of thy intimate friends go before him, and proclaim through the whole city, that whosoever the king honoreth obtaineth this mark of his honor. This was the advice which <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> gave, out of a supposal that such a reward would come to himself. Hereupon the king was pleased with the advice, and said, Go thou therefore, for thou hast the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, the garment, and the chain, ask for <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a>, and give him those things, and go before his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and proclaim accordingly; for thou art, said he, my intimate friend, and hast given me good advice; be thou then the minister of what thou hast advised me to. This shall be his reward from us, for preserving my life. When he heard this order, which was entirely unexpected, he was confounded in his mind, and knew not what to do. However, he went out and led the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and took the purple garment, and the golden chain for the neck, and finding <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> before the court, clothed in sackcloth, he bid him put that garment off, and put the purple garment on. But <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, not knowing the truth of the matter, but thinking that it was done in mockery, said, O thou wretch, the vilest of all mankind, dost thou thus laugh at our calamities? But when he was satisfied that the king bestowed this honor upon him, for the deliverance he had procured him when he convicted the eunuchs who had conspired against him, he put on that purple garment which the king always wore, and put the chain about his neck, and got on horseback, and went round the city, while <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> went before and proclaimed, This shall be the reward which the king will bestow on every one whom he loves, and esteems worthy of honor. And when they had gone round the city, <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> went in to the king; but <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> went home, out of shame, and informed his wife and friends of what had happened, and this with tears; who said, that he would never be able to be revenged of <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, for that God was with him. </p>                        </div>

So he knew that it was for the queen's uncle, because <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> was about to petition the king that he might be punished; but at present he held his peace. Now when the king, with <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, were at the banquet, he desired the queen to tell him what gifts she desired to obtain, and assured her that she should have whatsoever she had a mind to. She then lamented the danger her people were in; and said that she and her nation were given up to be destroyed, and that she, on that account, made this her petition; that she would not have troubled him if he had only given order that they should be sold into bitter servitude, for such a misfortune would not have been intolerable; but she desired that they might be delivered from such destruction. And when the king inquired of her whom was the author of this misery to them, she then openly accused <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, and convicted him, that he had been the wicked instrument of this, and had formed this plot against them.

And when <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> was astonished at this, and not able to speak one word more, <a href=/people/10199 target=_blank>Sabuchadas</a> the eunuch came in and accused <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, and said, He found a gallows at his house, prepared for <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>; for that the servant told him so much upon his inquiry, when he was sent to him to call him to supper. He said further, that the gallows was fifty cubits high: which, when the king heard, he determined that <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> should be punished after no other manner than that which had been devised by him against <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>; so he gave order immediately that he should be hung upon those gallows, and be put to death after that manner. And from hence I cannot forbear to admire God, and to learn hence his wisdom and his justice, not only in punishing the wickedness of <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, but in so disposing it, that he should undergo the very same punishment which he had contrived for another; as also because thereby he teaches others this lesson, that what mischiefs any one prepares against another, he, without knowing of it, first contrives it against himself. </p>                        </div>

He also called for <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, (for <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> had informed him that she was akin to him,) and gave that ring to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> which he had before given to <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>. The queen also gave <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>'s estate to <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>; and prayed the king to deliver the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> from the fear of death, and showed him what had been written over all the country by <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> the son of Ammedatha; for that if her country were destroyed, and her countrymen were to perish, she could not bear to live herself any longer. So the king promised her that he would not do any thing that should be disagreeable to her, nor contradict what she desired; but he bid her write what she pleased about the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, in the king's name, and seal it with his seal, and send it to all his kingdom, for that those who read letters whose authority is secured by having the king's seal to them, would no way contradict what was written therein. So he commanded the king's scribes to be sent for, and to write to the nations, on the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>' behalf, and to his lieutenants and governors, that were over his hundred twenty and seven provinces, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>. Now the contents of this letter were these: The great king <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> to our rulers, and those that are our faithful subjects, sendeth greeting. Many men there are who, on account of the greatness of the benefits bestowed on them, and because of the honor which they have obtained from the wonderful kind treatment of those that bestowed it, are not only injurious to their inferiors, but do not scruple to do evil to those that have been their benefactors, as if they would take away gratitude from among men, and by their insolent abuse of such benefits as they never expected, they turn the abundance they have against those that are the authors of it, and suppose they shall lie concealed from God in that case, and avoid that vengeance which comes from him. Some of these men, when they have had the management of affairs committed to them by their friends, and bearing private malice of their own against some others, by deceiving those that have the power, persuade them to be angry at such as have done them no harm, till they are in danger of perishing, and this by laying accusations and calumnies: nor is this state of things to be discovered by ancient examples, or such as we have learned by report only, but by some examples of such impudent attempts under our own eyes; so that it is not fit to attend any longer to calumnies and accusations, nor to the persuasions of others, but to determine what any one knows of himself to have been really done, and to punish what justly deserves it, and to grant favors to such as are innocent. This hath been the case of <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, the son of Ammedatha, by birth an Amalekite, and alien from the blood of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, who, when he was hospitably entertained by us, and partook of that kindness which we bear to all men to so great a degree, as to be called my father, and to be all along worshipped, and to have honor paid him by all in the second rank after the royal honor due to ourselves, he could not bear his good fortune, nor govern the magnitude of his prosperity with sound reason; nay, he made a conspiracy against me and my life, who gave him his authority, by endeavoring to take away <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a>, my benefactor, and my savior, and by basely and treacherously requiring to have <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a>, the partner of my life, and of my dominion, brought to destruction; for he contrived by this means to deprive me of my faithful friends, and transfer the government to others: but since I perceived that these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, that were by this pernicious fellow devoted to destruction, were not wicked men, but conducted their lives after the best manner, and were men dedicated to the worship of that God who hath preserved the kingdom to me and to my ancestors, I do not only free them from the punishment which the former letter, which was sent by <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, ordered to be inflicted on them, to which if you refuse obedience, you shall do well; but I will that they have all honor paid to them. Accordingly, I have hanged up the man that contrived such things against them, with his family, before the gates of <a href=/people/3961 target=_blank>Shushan</a>; that punishment being sent upon him by God, who seeth all things. And I give you in charge, that you publicly propose a copy of this letter through all my kingdom, that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> may be permitted peaceably to use their own laws, and that you assist them, that at the same season whereto their miserable estate did belong, they may defend themselves the very same day from unjust violence, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is <a href=/people/5401 target=_blank>Adar</a>; for God hath made that day a day of salvation instead of a day of destruction to them; and may it be a good day to those that wish us well, and a memorial of the punishment of the conspirators against us: and I will that you take notice, that every city, and every nation, that shall disobey any thing that is contained in this letter, shall be destroyed by fire and sword. However, let this letter be published through all the country that is under our obedience, and let all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, by all means, be ready against the day before mentioned, that they may avenge themselves upon their enemies. </p>                        </div>

But now the rulers of the provinces, and the tyrants, and the kings, and the scribes, had the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in esteem; for the fear they were in of <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> forced them to act with discretion. Now when the royal decree was come to all the country that was subject to the king, it fell out that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> at <a href=/people/3961 target=_blank>Shushan</a> slew five hundred of their enemies; and when the king had told <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a> the number of those that were slain in that city, but did not well know what had been done in the provinces, he asked her whether she would have any thing further done against them, for that it should be done accordingly: upon which she desired that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> might be permitted to treat their remaining enemies in the same manner the next day; as also that they might hang the ten sons of <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a> upon the gallows. So the king permitted the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> so to do, as desirous not to contradict <a href=/people/1829 target=_blank>Esther</a>. So they gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month <a href=/people/4979 target=_blank>Dystrus</a>, and slew about three hundred of their enemies, but touched nothing of what riches they had. Now there were slain by the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were in the country, and in the other cities, seventy-five thousand of their enemies, and these were slain on the thirteenth day of the month, and the next day they kept as a festival. In like manner the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were in <a href=/people/3961 target=_blank>Shushan</a> gathered themselves together, and feasted on the fourteenth day, and that which followed it; whence it is that even now all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that are in the habitable earth keep these days festival, and send portions to one another. <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> also wrote to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that lived in the kingdom of <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a> to observe these days, and celebrate them as festivals, and to deliver them down to posterity, that this festival might continue for all time to come, and that it might never be buried in oblivion; for since they were about to be destroyed on these days by <a href=/people/1427 target=_blank>Haman</a>, they would do a right thing, upon escaping the danger in them, and on them inflicting punishment on their enemies, to observe those days, and give thanks to God on them; for which cause the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> still keep the forementioned days, and call them days of Phurim [or Purim.] And <a href=/people/1449 target=_blank>Mordecai</a> became a great and illustrious person with the king, and assisted him in the government of the people.

He also told him further, that he would build him a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> like that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, upon Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322353SGar class=place long=35.2732 lat=32.2009>Gerizzim</a>, which is the highest of all the mountains that are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>; and he promised that he would do this with the approbation of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> the king. <a href=/people/2328 target=_blank>Manasseh</a> was elevated with these promises, and staid with <a href=/people/2928 target=_blank>Sanballat</a>, upon a supposal that he should gain a high priesthood, as bestowed on him by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, for it happened that <a href=/people/2928 target=_blank>Sanballat</a> was then in years. But there was now a great disturbance among the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, because many of those priests and Levites were entangled in such matches; for they all revolted to <a href=/people/2328 target=_blank>Manasseh</a>, and <a href=/people/2928 target=_blank>Sanballat</a> afforded them money, and divided among them land for tillage, and habitations also, and all this in order every way to gratify his son-in-law. </p>                        </div>

His mother also, and his wife and children, were taken captives, and he fled into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>.

So when he had, with a good deal of pains during the siege, taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and had settled its affairs, he came to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a>, and besieged both the city and him that was governor of the garrison, whose name was Babemeses. </p>                        </div>

So when <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had received him kindly, <a href=/people/2928 target=_blank>Sanballat</a> thereupon took courage, and spake to him about his present affair.

He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications, and should join with him in offering sacrifice to God, whom he besought to protect that nation, and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon them; whereupon God warned him in a dream, which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice, that he should take courage, and adorn the city, and open the gates; that the rest should appear in white garments, but that he and the priests should meet the king in the habits proper to their order, without the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence of God would prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly rejoiced, and declared to all the warning he had received from God.

The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> also did all together, with one voice, salute <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and encompass him about; whereupon the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and the rest were surprised at what <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had done, and supposed him disordered in his mind. However, <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> alone went up to him, and asked him how it came to pass that, when all others adored him, he should adore the high priest of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>? To whom he replied, I did not adore him, but that God who hath honored him with his high priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225PDio class=place long=22.4887 lat=40.1749>Dion</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, who, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass over the sea thither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give me the dominion over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>; whence it is that, having seen no other in that habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering that vision, and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under the Divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, and destroy the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind. And when he had said this to <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>, and had given the high priest his right hand, the priests ran along by him, and he came into the city. And when he went up into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, he offered sacrifice to God, according to the high priest's direction, and magnificently treated both the high priest and the priests.

And as he was then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present; but the next day he called them to him, and bid them ask what favors they pleased of him; whereupon the high priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He granted all they desired. And when they entreared him that he would permit the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a> to enjoy their own laws also, he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired.

FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT TO THE DEATH OF JUDAS MACCABEUS. NOW when <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a>, had put an end to the dominion of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and had settled the affairs in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> after the forementioned manner, he ended his life. And as his government fell among many, <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> obtained Asia, <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>; and of the other nations which were there, <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> governed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, and <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a> possessed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>; as did <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a> seize upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. And while these princes ambitiously strove one against another, every one for his own principality, it came to pass that there were continual wars, and those lasting wars too; and the cities were sufferers, and lost a great many of their inhabitants in these times of distress, insomuch that all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, by the means of <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, underwent the reverse of that denomination of <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, which he then had. He also seized upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and for that end made use of deceit and treachery; for as he came into the city on a sabbath day, as if he would offer sacrifices he, without any trouble, gained the city, while the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> did not oppose him, for they did not suspect him to be their enemy; and he gained it thus, because they were free from suspicion of him, and because on that day they were at rest and quietness; and when he had gained it, he ruled over it in a cruel manner. Nay, <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>, who wrote the acts of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s successors, reproaches us with superstition, as if we, by it, had lost our liberty; where he says thus: There is a nation called the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, who inhabit a city strong and great, named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. These men took no care, but let it come into the hands of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, as not willing to take arms, and thereby they submitted to be under a hard master, by reason of their unseasonable superstition. This is what <a href=/people/1500 target=_blank>Agatharchides</a> relates of our nation. But when <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> had taken a great many captives, both from the mountainous parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and from the places about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, and the places near Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322353SGar class=place long=35.2732 lat=32.2009>Garizin</a>, he led them all into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and settled them there. And as he knew that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> were most faithful in the observation of oaths and covenants; and this from the answer they made to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, when he sent an embassy to them, after he had beaten <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in battle; so he distributed many of them into garrisons, and at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> gave them equal privileges of citizens with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> themselves; and required of them to take their oaths, that they would keep their fidelity to the posterity of those who committed these places to their care. Nay, there were not a few other <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who, of their own accord, went into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, as invited by the goodness of the soil, and by the liberality of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>. However, there were disorders among their posterity, with relation to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a>, on account of their resolution to preserve that conduct of life which was delivered to them by their forefathers, and they thereupon contended one with another, while those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> said that their <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was holy, and resolved to send their sacrifices thither; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a> were resolved that they should be sent to Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322353SGar class=place long=35.2732 lat=32.2009>Garizin</a>. </p>                        </div>

He procured the law to be interpreted, and set free those that were come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and were in slavery there, who were a hundred and twenty thousand. The occasion was this: <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> <a href=/people/10908 target=_blank>Phalerius</a>, who was library keeper to the king, was now endeavoring, if it were possible, to gather together all the books that were in the habitable earth, and buying whatsoever was any where valuable, or agreeable to the king's inclination, (who was very earnestly set upon collecting of books,) to which inclination of his <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> was zealously subservient. And when once <a href=/people/8222 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> asked him how many ten thousands of books he had collected, he replied, that he had already about twenty times ten thousand; but that, in a little time, he should have fifty times ten thousand. But be said he had been informed that there were many books of laws among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> worthy of inquiring after, and worthy of the king's library, but which, being written in characters and in a dialect of their own, will cause no small pains in getting them translated into the Greek tongue; that the character in which they are written seems to be like to that which is the proper character of the Syrians, and that its sound, when pronounced, is like theirs also; and that this sound appears to be peculiar to themselves. Wherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get those books to be translated also; for while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that purpose, we may have their books also in this library. So the king thought that <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> was very zealous to procure him abundance of books, and that he suggested what was exceeding proper for him to do; and therefore he wrote to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> high priest, that he should act accordingly. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/1738 target=_blank>Aristeus</a> resolved frequently, and that before now, to petition the king that he would set all the captive <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in his kingdom free; and he thought this to be a convenient opportunity for the making that petition. So he discoursed, in the first place, with the captains of the king's guards, <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=person long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, and <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a>, and persuaded them to assist him in what he was going to intercede with the king for. Accordingly <a href=/people/1738 target=_blank>Aristeus</a> embraced the same opinion with those that have been before mentioned, and went to the king, and made the following speech to him: It is not fit for us, O king, to overlook things hastily, or to deceive ourselves, but to lay the truth open. For since we have determined not only to get the laws of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> transcribed, but interpreted also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can we do this, while so many of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> are now slaves in thy kingdom? Do thou then what will be agreeable to thy magnanimity, and to thy good nature: free them from the miserable condition they are in, because that God, who supporteth thy kingdom, was the author of their laws as I have learned by particular inquiry; for both these people, and we also, worship the same God the framer of all things. We call him, and that truly, by the name of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> [Ζηνα], because he breathes life [το ζην] into all men. Wherefore do thou restore these men to their own country, and this do to the honor of God, because these men pay a peculiarly excellent worship to him. And know this further, that though I be not of kin to them by birth, nor one of the same country with them, yet do I desire these favors to be done them, since all men are the workmanship of God; and I am sensible that he is well-pleased with those that do good. I do therefore put up this petition to thee, to do good to them. </p>                        </div>

To which <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a> replied, as he stood by, and said, A few more than ten times ten thousand. The king made answer, And is this a small gift that thou askest, <a href=/people/1738 target=_blank>Aristeus</a>? But <a href=/people/889 target=_blank>Sosibius</a>, and the rest that stood by, said that he ought to offer such a thank-offering as was worthy of his greatness of soul, to that God who had given him his kingdom. With this answer he was much pleased; and gave order, that when they paid the soldiers their wages, they should lay down [a hundred and] twenty drachmas for every one of the slaves? And he promised to publish a magnificent decree, about what they requested, which should confirm what <a href=/people/1738 target=_blank>Aristeus</a> had proposed, and especially what God willed should be done; whereby he said he would not only set those free who had been led away captive by his father and his army, but those who were in this kingdom before, and those also, if any such there were, who had been brought away since. And when they said that their redemption money would amount to above four hundred talents, he granted it. A copy of which decree I have determined to preserve, that the magnanimity of this king may be made known. Its contents were as follows: Let ail those who were soldiers under our father, and who, when they overran <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, and laid waste <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, took the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> captives, and made them slaves, and brought them into our cities, and into this country, and then sold them; as also all those that were in my kingdom before them, and if there be any that have been lately brought thither, — be made free by those that possess them; and let them accept of [a hundred and] twenty drachmas for every slave. And let the soldiers receive this redemption money with their pay, but the rest out of the king's treasury: for I suppose that they were made captives without our father's consent, and against equity; and that their country was harassed by the insolence of the soldiers, and that, by removing them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, the soldiers have made a great profit by them. Out of regard therefore to justice, and out of pity to those that have been tyrannized over, contrary to equity, I enjoin those that have such <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in their service to set them at liberty, upon the receipt of the before-mentioned sum; and that no one use any deceit about them, but obey what is here commanded. And I will that they give in their names within three days after the publication of this edict, to such as are appointed to execute the same, and to produce the slaves before them also, for I think it will be for the advantage of my affairs. And let every one that will inform against those that do not obey this decree, and I will that their estates be confiscated into the king's treasury. When this decree was read to the king, it at first contained the rest that is here inserted, and omitted only those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that had formerly been brought, and those brought afterwards, which had not been distinctly mentioned; so he added these clauses out of his humanity, and with great generosity. He also gave order that the payment, which was likely to be done in a hurry, should be divided among the king's ministers, and among the officers of his treasury. When this was over, what the king had decreed was quickly brought to a conclusion; and this in no more than seven days' time, the number of the talents paid for the captives being above four hundred and sixty, and this, because their masters required the [hundred and] twenty drachmas for the children also, the king having, in effect, commanded that these should be paid for, when he said in his decree, that they should receive the forementioned sum for every slave. </p>                        </div>

On which account I have subjoined a copy of these letters, and set down the multitude of the vessels sent as gifts [to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>], and the construction of every one, that the exactness of the artificers' workmanship, as it appeared to those that saw them, and which workman made every vessel, may be made manifest, and. this on account of the excellency of the vessels themselves. Now the copy of the letter was to this purpose: <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> to the great king. When thou, O king, gavest me a charge concerning the collection of books that were wanting to fill your library, and concerning the care that ought to be taken about such as are imperfect, I have used the utmost diligence about those matters. And I let you know, that we want the books of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> legislation, with some others; for they are written in the Hebrew characters, and being in the language of that nation, are to us unknown. It hath also happened to them, that they have been transcribed more carelessly than they ought to have been, because they have not had hitherto royal care taken about them. Now it is necessary that thou shouldst have accurate copies of them. And indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom, and entirely blameless, as being the legislation of God; for which cause it is, as Hecateus of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=person long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a> says, that the poets and historians make no mention of it, nor of those men who lead their lives according to it, since it is a holy law, and ought not to be published by profane mouths. If then it please thee, O king, thou mayst write to the high priest of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, to send six of the elders out of every tribe, and those such as are most skillful of the laws, that by their means we may learn the clear and agreeing sense of these books, and may obtain an accurate interpretation of their contents, and so may have such a collection of these as may be suitable to thy desire. </p>                        </div>

These were honored by my father; some of them he placed in the army, and gave them greater pay than ordinary; to others of them, when they came with him into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, he committed his garrisons, and the guarding of them, that they might be a terror to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. And when I had taken the government, I treated all men with humanity, and especially those that are thy fellow citizens, of whom I have set free above a hundred thousand that were slaves, and paid the price of their redemption to their masters out of my own revenues; and those that are of a fit age, I have admitted into them number of my soldiers. And for such as are capable of being faithful to me, and proper for my court, I have put them in such a post, as thinking this [kindness done to them] to be a very great and an acceptable gift, which I devote to God for his providence over me. And as I am desirous to do what will be grateful to these, and to all the other <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in the habitable earth, I have determined to procure an interpretation of your law, and to have it translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and to be deposited in my library. Thou wilt therefore do well to choose out and send to me men of a good character, who are now elders in age, and six in number out of every tribe. These, by their age, must be skillful in the laws, and of abilities to make an accurate interpretation of them; and when this shall be finished, I shall think that I have done a work glorious to myself. And I have sent to thee <a href=/people/2091 target=_blank>Andreas</a>, the captain of my guard, and <a href=/people/1738 target=_blank>Aristeus</a>, men whom I have in very great esteem; by whom I have sent those first-fruits which I have dedicated to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and to the sacrifices, and to other uses, to the value of a hundred talents.

We have also chosen six elders out of every tribe, whom we have sent, and the law with them.

However, I thought it not improper to give an account of those very valuable and artificially contrived vessels which the king sent to God, that all may see how great a regard the king had for God; for the king allowed a vast deal of expenses for these vessels, and came often to the workmen, and viewed their works, and suffered nothing of carelessness or negligence to be any damage to their operations. And I will relate how rich they were as well as I am able, although perhaps the nature of this history may not require such a description; but I imagine I shall thereby recommend the elegant taste and magnanimity of this king to those that read this history. </p>                        </div>

It was indeed in the king's mind to make this table vastly large in its dimensions; but then he gave orders that they should learn what was the magnitude of the table which was already at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and how large it was, and whether there was a possibility of making one larger than it. And when he was informed how large that was which was already there, and that nothing hindered but a larger might be made, he said that he was willing to have one made that should be five times as large as the present table; but his fear was, that it might be then useless in their sacred ministrations by its too great largeness; for he desired that the gifts he presented them should not only be there for show, but should be useful also in their sacred ministrations. According to which reasoning, that the former table was made of so moderate a size for use, and not for want of gold, he resolved that he would not exceed the former table in largeness; but would make it exceed it in the variety and elegancy of its materials. And as he was sagacious in observing the nature of all things, and in having a just notion of what was new and surprising, and where there was no sculptures, he would invent such as were proper by his own skill, and would show them to the workmen, he commanded that such sculptures should now be made, and that those which were delineated should be most accurately formed by a constant regard to their delineation. </p>                        </div>

They withal made a crown of a hand-breadth round it, with wave-work wreathed about it, and with an engraving which imitated a cord, and was admirably turned on its three parts; for as they were of a triangular figure, every angle had the same disposition of its sculptures, that when you turned them about, the very same form of them was turned about without any variation. Now that part of the crown-work that was enclosed under the table had its sculptures very beautiful; but that part which went round on the outside was more elaborately adorned with most beautiful ornaments, because it was exposed to sight, and to the view of the spectators; for which reason it was that both those sides which were extant above the rest were acute, and none of the angles, which we before told you were three, appeared less than another, when the table was turned about. Now into the cordwork thus turned were precious stones inserted, in rows parallel one to the other, enclosed in golden buttons, which had ouches in them; but the parts which were on the side of the crown, and were exposed to the sight, were adorned with a row of oval figures obliquely placed, of the most excellent sort of precious stones, which imitated rods laid close, and encompassed the table round about. But under these oval figures, thus engraven, the workmen had put a crown all round it, where the nature of all sorts of fruit was represented, insomuch that the bunches of grapes hung up. And when they had made the stones to represent all the kinds of fruit before mentioned, and that each in its proper color, they made them fast with gold round the whole table. The like disposition of the oval figures, and of the engraved rods, was framed under the crown, that the table might on each side show the same appearance of variety and elegancy of its ornaments; so that neither the position of the wave-work nor of the crown might be different, although the table were turned on the other side, but that the prospect of the same artificial contrivances might be extended as far as the feet; for there was made a plate of gold four fingers broad, through the entire breadth of the table, into which they inserted the feet, and then fastened them to the table by buttons and button-holes, at the place where the crown was situate, that so on what side soever of the table one should stand, it might exhibit the very same view of the exquisite workmanship, and of the vast expeses bestowed upon it: but upon the table itself they engraved a meander, inserting into it very valuable stones in the middle like stars, of various colors; the carbuncle and the emerald, each of which sent out agreeable rays of light to the spectators; with such stones of other sorts also as were most curious and best esteemed, as being most precious in their kind. Hard by this meander a texture of net-work ran round it, the middle of which appeared like a rhombus, into which were inserted rock-crystal and amber, which, by the great resemblance of the appearance they made, gave wonderful delight to those that saw them. The chapiters of the feet imitated the first buddings of lilies, while their leaves were bent and laid under the table, but so that the chives were seen standing upright within them. Their bases were made of a carbuncle; and the place at the bottom, which rested on that carbuncle, was one palm deep, and eight fingers in breadth. Now they had engraven upon it with a very fine tool, and with a great deal of pains, a branch of ivy and tendrils of the vine, sending forth clusters of grapes, that you would guess they were nowise different from real tendrils; for they were so very thin, and so very far extended at their extremities, that they were moved with the wind, and made one believe that they were the product of nature, and not the representation of art. They also made the entire workmanship of the table appear to be threefold, while the joints of the several parts were so united together as to be invisible, and the places where they joined could not be distinguished. Now the thickness of the table was not less than half a cubit. So that this gift, by the king's great generosity, by the great value of the materials, and the variety of its exquisite structure, and the artificer's skill in imitating nature with graying tools, was at length brought to perfection, while the king was very desirous, that though in largeness it were not to be different from that which was already dedicated to God, yet that in exquisite workmanship, and the novelty of the contrivances, and in the splendor of its construction, it should far exceed it, and be more illustrious than that was. </p>                        </div>

Next to which there was upon it a meander of a cubit in height; it was composed of stones of all sorts of colors. And next to this was the rod-work engraven; and next to that was a rhombus in a texture of net-work, drawn out to the brim of the basin, while small shields, made of stones, beautiful in their kind, and of four fingers' depth, filled up the middle parts. About the top of the basin were wreathed the leaves of lilies, and of the convolvulus, and the tendrils of vines in a circular manner. And this was the construction of the two cisterns of gold, each containing two firkins. But those which were of silver were much more bright and splendid than looking-glasses, and you might in them see the images that fell upon them more plainly than in the other. The king also ordered thirty vials; those of which the parts that were of gold, and filled up with precious stones, were shadowed over with the leaves of ivy and of vines, artificially engraven. And these were the vessels that were after an extraordinary manner brought to this perfection, partly by the skill of the workmen, who were admirable in such fine work, but much more by the diligence and generosity of the king, who not only supplied the artificers abundantly, and with great generosity, with what they wanted, but he forbade public audiences for the time, and came and stood by the workmen, and saw the whole operation. And this was the cause why the workmen were so accurate in their performance, because they had regard to the king, and to his great concern about the vessels, and so the more indefatigably kept close to the work. </p>                        </div>

But when <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a> the high priest had devoted them to God, and had paid due respect to those that brought them, and had given them presents to be carried to the king, he dismissed them.

But when he had sent those away, he waited for these that were sent by <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>; but as the old men came in with the presents, which the high priest had given them to bring to the king, and with the membranes, upon which they had their laws written in golden letters he put questions to them concerning those books; and when they had taken off the covers wherein they were wrapt up, they showed him the membranes. So the king stood admiring the thinness of those membranes, and the exactness of the junctures, which could not be perceived; (so exactly were they connected one with another;) and this he did for a considerable time. He then said that he returned them thanks for coming to him, and still greater thanks to him that sent them; and, above all, to that God whose laws they appeared to be. Then did the elders, and those that were present with them, cry out with one voice, and wished all happiness to the king. Upon which he fell into tears by the violence of the pleasure he had, it being natural to men to afford the same indications in great joy that they do under sorrows. And when he had bid them deliver the books to those that were appointed to receive them, he saluted the men, and said that it was but just to discourse, in the first place, of the errand they were sent about, and then to address himself to themselves. He promised, however, that he would make this day on which they came to him remarkable and eminent every year through the whole course of his life; for their coming to him, and the victory which he gained over <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> by sea, proved to be on the very same day.

And this was now done in the case of these men by <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, who was put into this office because of his great skill in such matters belonging to common life; for he took care of all such matters as concerned the reception of strangers, and appointed them double seats for them to sit on, according as the king had commanded him to do; for he had commanded that half of their seats should be set at his right hand, and the other half behind his table, and took care that no respect should be omitted that could be shown them.

Upon which an acclamation was made by the whole company, with joy and a great noise; and when that. was over, they fell to eating their supper, and to the enjoyment of what was set before them. And at a little interval afterward, when the king thought a sufficient time had been interposed, he began to talk philosophically to them, and he asked every one of them a philosophical question and such a one as might give light in those inquiries; and when they had explained all the problems that had been proposed by the king about every point, he was well-pleased with their answers.

But the king said that he had gained very great advantages by their coming, for that he had received this profit from them, that he had learned how he ought to rule his subjects. And he gave order that they should have every one three talents given them, and that those that were to conduct them to their lodging should do it. Accordingly, when three days were over, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> took them, and went over the causeway seven furlongs long: it was a bank in the sea to an island. And when they had gone over the bridge, he proceeded to the northern parts, and showed them where they should meet, which was in a house that was built near the shore, and was a quiet place, and fit for their discoursing together about their work. When he had brought them thither, he entreated them (now they had all things about them which they wanted for the interpretation of their law) that they would suffer nothing to interrupt them in their work. Accordingly, they made an accurate interpretation, with great zeal and great pains, and this they continued to do till the ninth hour of the day; after which time they relaxed, and took care of their body, while their food was provided for them in great plenty: besides, <a href=/people/1368 target=_blank>Dorotheus</a>, at the king's command, brought them a great deal of what was provided for the king himself. But in the morning they came to the court and saluted <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and then went away to their former place, where, when they had washed their hands, and purified themselves, they betook themselves to the interpretation of the laws. Now when the law was transcribed, and the labor of interpretation was over, which came to its conclusion in seventy-two days, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> gathered all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> together to the place where the laws were translated, and where the interpreters were, and read them over. The multitude did also approve of those elders that were the interpreters of the law. They withal commended <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> for his proposal, as the inventor of what was greatly for their happiness; and they desired that he would give leave to their rulers also to read the law. Moreover, they all, both the priest and the ancientest of the elders, and the principal men of their commonwealth, made it their request, that since the interpretation was happily finished, it might continue in the state it now was, and might not be altered. And when they all commended that determination of theirs, they enjoined, that if any one observed either any thing superfluous, or any thing omitted, that he would take a view of it again, and have it laid before them, and corrected; which was a wise action of theirs, that when the thing was judged to have been well done, it might continue for ever. </p>                        </div>

And he began to discourse with <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, How it came to pass, that when this legislation was so wonderful, no one, either of the poets or of the historians, had made mention of it. <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> made answer, that no one durst be so bold as to touch upon the description of these laws, because they were Divine and venerable, and because some that had attempted it were afflicted by God. He also told him, that <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> was desirous of writing somewhat about them, but was thereupon disturbed in his mind for above thirty days' time; and upon some intermission of his distemper, he appeased God [by prayer], as suspecting that his madness proceeded from that cause. Nay, indeed, he further saw in a dream, that his distemper befell him while he indulged too great a curiosity about Divine matters, and was desirous of publishing them among common men; but when he left off that attempt, he recovered his understanding again. Moreover, he informed him of <a href=/people/1855 target=_blank>Theodectes</a>, the tragic poet, concerning whom it was reported, that when in a certain dramatic representation he was desirous to make mention of things that were contained in the sacred books, he was afflicted with a darkness in his eyes; and that upon his being conscious of the occasion of his distemper, and appeasing God [by prayer], he was freed from that affliction. </p>                        </div>

He also desired that the interpreters would come often to him out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and that both on account of the respects that he would pay them, and on account of the presents he would make them; for he said it was now but just to send them away, although if, of their own accord, they would come to him hereafter, they should obtain all that their own wisdom might justly require, and what his generosity was able to give them. So he then sent them away, and gave to every one of them three garments of the best sort, and two talents of gold, and a cup of the value of one talent, and the furniture of the room wherein they were feasted. And these were the things he presented to them. But by them he sent to <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a> the high priest ten beds, with feet of silver, and the furniture to them belonging, and a cup of the value of thirty talents; and besides these, ten garments, and purple, and a very beautiful crown, and a hundred pieces of the finest woven linen; as also vials and dishes, and vessels for pouring, and two golden cisterns to be dedicated to God. He also desired him, by an letter, that he would give these interpreters leave, if any of them were desirous of coming to him, because he highly valued a conversation with men of such learning, and should be very willing to lay out his wealth upon such men.

But at length, when <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had beaten <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, he seized upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>; and when <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a> was dead, his son sent out a great army under <a href=/people/815 target=_blank>Scopas</a>, the general of his forces, against the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a>, who took many of their cities, and in particular our nation; which when he fell upon them, went over to him.

And, in the first place, we have determined, on account of their piety towards God, to bestow on them, as a pension, for their sacrifices of animals that are fit for sacrifice, for wine, and oil, and frankincense, the value of twenty thousand pieces of silver, and [six] sacred artabrae of fine flour, with one thousand four hundred and sixty medimni of wheat, and three hundred and seventy-five medimni of salt. And these payments I would have fully paid them, as I have sent orders to you.

And that the city may the sooner recover its inhabitants, I grant a discharge from taxes for three years to its present inhabitants, and to such as shall come to it, until the month Hyperheretus. We also discharge them for the future from a third part of their taxes, that the losses they have sustained may be repaired. And all those citizens that have been carried away, and are become slaves, we grant them and their children their freedom, and give order that their substance be restored to them. </p>                        </div>

Having been informed that a sedition is arisen in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=place long=28 lat=38.5>Lydia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, I thought that matter required great care; and upon advising with my friends what was fit to be done, it hath been thought proper to remove two thousand families of <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, with their effects, out of <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, unto the castles and places that lie most convenient; for I am persuaded that they will be well-disposed guardians of our possessions, because of their piety towards God, and because I know that my predecessors have borne witness to them, that they are faithful, and with alacrity do what they are desired to do. I will, therefore, though it be a laborious work, that thou remove these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, under a promise, that they shall be permitted to use their own laws. And when thou shalt have brought them to the places forementioned, thou shalt give everyone of their families a place for building their houses, and a portion of the land for their husbandry, and for the plantation of their vines; and thou shalt discharge them from paying taxes of the fruits of the earth for ten years; and let them have a proper quantity of wheat for the maintenance of their servants, until they receive bread corn out of the earth; also let a sufficient share be given to such as minister to them in the necessaries of life, that by enjoying the effects of our humanity, they may show themselves the more willing and ready about our affairs. Take care likewise of that nation, as far as thou art able, that they may not have any disturbance given them by any one. Now these testimonials which I have produced are sufficient to declare the friendship that <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> the Great bare to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now at this time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a> were in a flourishing condition, and much distressed the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, cutting off parts of their land, and carrying off slaves. This happened when <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> was high priest; for after <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>'s death, his uncle <a href=/people/2328 target=_blank>Manasseh</a> took the priesthood, and after he had ended his life, <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> received that dignity. He was the son of <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, who was called The Just: which <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> was the brother of <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, as I said before. This <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> was one of a little soul, and a great lover of money; and for that reason, because he did not pay that tax of twenty talents of silver, which his forefathers paid to these things out of their own estates, he provoked king <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/2014 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> to anger, who was the father of <a href=/people/10150 target=_blank>Philopator</a>. <a href=/people/2014 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> sent an ambassador to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and complained that <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> did not pay his taxes, and threatened, that if he did not receive them, he would seize upon their land, and send soldiers to live upon it. When the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> heard this message of the king, they were confounded; but so sordidly covetous was <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a>, that nothing of things nature made him ashamed. </p>                        </div>

His father's name was <a href=/people/7005 target=_blank>Tobias</a>; and his mother was the sister of <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> the high priest, who informed him of the coming of the ambassador; for he was then sojourning at a village named Phicol, where he was born. Hereupon he came to the city [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>], and reproved <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> for not taking care of the preservation of his countrymen, but bringing the nation into dangers, by not paying this money. For which preservation of them, he told him he had received the authority over them, and had been made high priest; but that, in case he was so great a lover of money, as to endure to see his country in danger on that account, and his countrymen suffer the greatest damages, he advised him to go to the king, and petition him to remit either the whole or a part of the sum demanded. <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a>'s answer was this: That he did not care for his authority, and that he was ready, if the thing were practicable, to lay down his high priesthood; and that he would not go to the king, because he troubled not himself at all about such matters. Joseph then asked him if he would not give him leave to go ambassador on behalf of the nation. He replied, that he would give him leave. Upon which Joseph went up into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>sanctuary</a>, and called the multitude together to a congregation, and exhorted them not to be disturbed nor affrighted, because of his uncle <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a>'s carelessness, but desired them to be at rest, and not terrify themselves with fear about it; for he promised them that he would be their ambassador to the king, and persuade him that they had done him no wrong.

So he went down from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>sanctuary</a>, and treated <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s ambassador in a hospitable manner. He also presented him with rich gifts, and feasted him magnificently for many days, and then sent him to the king before him, and told him that he would soon follow him; for he was now more willing to go to the king, by the encouragement of the ambassador, who earnestly persuaded him to come into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and promised him that he would take care that he should obtain every thing that he desired of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>; for he was highly pleased with his frank and liberal temper, and with the gravity of his deportment. </p>                        </div>

In short, he was so very large in his encomiums upon the young man, that he disposed both the king and his wife <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> to have a kindness for him before he came. So Joseph sent to his friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, and borrowed money of them, and got ready what was necessary for his journey, garments and cups, and beasts for burden, which amounted to about twenty thousand drachmae, and went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>.

As soon therefore as <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a> saw him, he presently made him known to the king, how good and generous a young man he was. So <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> saluted him first, and desired him to come up into his chariot; and as Joseph sat there, he began to complain of the management of <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a>: to which he answered, Forgive him, on account of his age; for thou canst not certainly be unacquainted with this, that old men and infants have their minds exactly alike; but thou shalt have from us, who are young men, every thing thou desirest, and shalt have no cause to complain. With this good humor and pleasantry of the young man, the king was so delighted, that he began already, as though he had had long experience of him, to have a still greater affection for him, insomuch that he bade him take his diet in the king's palace, and be a guest at his own table every day. But when the king was come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, the principal men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> saw him sitting with the king, and were much offended at it. </p>                        </div>

Hereupon Joseph accused the bidders, as having agreed together to estimate the value of the taxes at too low a rate; and he promised that he would himself give twice as much for them: but for those who did not pay, he would send the king home their whole substance; for this privilege was sold together with the taxes themselves. The king was pleased to hear that offer; and because it augmented his revenues, he said he would confirm the sale of the taxes to him. But when he asked him this question, Whether he had any sureties that would be bound for the payment of the money? he answered very pleasantly, I will give such security, and those of persons good and responsible, and which you shall have no reason to distrust. And when he bid him name them who they were, he replied, I give thee no other persons, O king, for my sureties, than thyself, and this thy wife; and you shall be security for both parties. So <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> laughed at the proposal, and granted him the farming of the taxes without any sureties. This procedure was a sore grief to those that came from the cities into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, who were utterly disappointed; and they returned every one to their own country with shame. </p>                        </div>

By this means he gathered great wealth together, and made vast gains by this farming of the taxes; and he made use of what estate he had thus gotten, in order to support his authority, as thinking it a piece of prudence to keep what had been the occasion and foundation of his present good fortune; and this he did by the assistance of what he was already possessed of, for he privately sent many presents to the king, and to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, and to their friends, and to all that were powerful about the court, and thereby purchased their good-will to himself. </p>                        </div>

He once came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> with his brother, who had along with him a daughter already marriageable, in order to give her in wedlock to some of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> of chief dignity there. He then supped with the king, and falling in love with an actress that was of great beauty, and came into the room where they feasted, he told his brother of it, and entreated him, because a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> is forbidden by their law to come near to a foreigner, to conceal his offense; and to be kind and subservient to him, and to give him an opportunity of fulfilling his desires. Upon which his brother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him, and adorned his own daughter, and brought her to him by night, and put her into his bed. And Joseph, being disordered with drink, knew not who she was, and so lay with his brother's daughter; and this did he many times, and loved her exceedingly; and said to his brother, that he loved this actress so well, that he should run the hazard of his life [if he must part with her], and yet probably the king would not give him leave [to take her with him]. But his brother bid him be in no concern about that matter, and told him he might enjoy her whom he loved without any danger, and might have her for his wife; and opened the truth of the matter to him, and assured him that he chose rather to have his own daughter abused, than to overlook him, and se him come to [public] disgrace. So Joseph commended him for this his brotherly love, and married his daughter; and by her begat a son, whose name was <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, as we said before. And when this his youngest son showed, at thirteen years old, a mind that was both courageous and wise, and was greatly envied by his brethren, as being of a genius much above them, and such a one as they might well envy, Joseph had once a mind to know which of his sons had the best disposition to virtue; and when he sent them severally to those that had then the best reputation for instructing youth, the rest of his children, by reason of their sloth and unwillingness to take pains, returned to him foolish and unlearned. After them he sent out the youngest, <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, and gave him three hundred yoke of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and bid him go two days' journey into the wilderness, and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> the land there, and yet kept back privately the yokes of the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> that coupled them together. When <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> came to the place, and found he had no yokes with him, he contenmed the drivers of the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, who advised him to send some to his father, to bring them some yokes; but he thinking that he ought not to lose his time while they should be sent to bring him the yokes, he invented a kind of stratagem, and what suited an age older than his own; for he slew ten yoke of the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>, and distributed their flesh among the laborers, and cut their hides into several pieces, and made him yokes, and yoked the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> together with them; by which means he sowed as much land as his father had appointed him to sow, and returned to him. And when he was come back, his father was mightily pleased with his sagacity, and commended the sharpness of his understanding, and his boldness in what he did.

And when the elder sons excused themselves from going, and said they were not courtiers good enough for such conversation, and advised him to send their brother <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, he gladly hearkened to that advice, and called <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, and asked him whether he would go to the king, and whether it was agreeable to him to go or not. And upon his promise that he would go, and his saying that he should not want much money for his journey, because he would live moderately, and that ten thousand drachmas would be sufficient, he was pleased with his son's prudence. After a little while, the son advised his father not to send his presents to the king from thence, but to give him a letter to his steward at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, that he might furnish him with money, for purchasing what should be most excellent and most precious.

At which the steward was angry, and rebuked him, as one that intended to live extravagantly; and he let him know how his father had gathered together his estate by painstaking, and resisting his inclinations, and wished him to imitate the example of his father: he assured him withal, that he would give him but ten talents, and that for a present to the king also. The son was irritated at this, and threw <a href=/people/777 target=_blank>Arion</a> into prison. But when <a href=/people/777 target=_blank>Arion</a>'s wife had informed <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> of this, with her entreaty, that she would rebuke the child for what he had done, (for <a href=/people/777 target=_blank>Arion</a> was in great esteem with her,) <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> informed the king of it.

And he gave order, therefore, that he should come to him, and give an account of the reason of what he had done. And they report that the answer he made to the king's messenger was this: That there was a law of his that forbade a child that was born to taste of the sacrifice, before he had been at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>sanctuary</a> and sacrificed to God. According to which way of reasoning he did not himself come to him in expectation of the present he was to make to him, as to one who had been his father's benefactor; and that he had punished the slave for disobeying his commands, for that it mattered not Whether a master was little or great: so that unless we punish such as these, thou thyself mayst also expect to be despised by thy subjects.

So after three days were over, <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> came and saluted the king and queen. They saw him with pleasure, and feasted him in an obliging manner, out of the respect they bare to his father. So he came to the merchants privately, and bought a hundred boys, that had learning, and were in the flower of their ages, each at a talent apiece; as also he bought a hundred maidens, each at the same price as the other. And when he was invited to feast with the king among the principal men in the country, he sat down the lowest of them all, because he was little regarded, as a child in age still; and this by those who placed every one according to their dignity. Now when all those that sat with him had laid the bones Of the several parts on a heap before <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, (for they had themselves taken away the flesh belonging to them,) till the table where he sat was filled full with them, <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a>, who was the king's jester, and was appointed for jokes and laughter at festivals, was now asked by the guests that sat at the table [to expose him to laughter]. So he stood by the king, and said, Dost thou not see, my lord, the bones that lie by <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>? by this similitude thou mayst conjecture that his father made all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> as bare as he hath made these bones. And the king laughing at what <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a> said, and asking of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, How he came to have so many bones before him? he replied, Very rightfully, my lord; for they are <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> that eat the flesh and the bones together, as these thy guests have done, (looking in the mean time at those guests,) for there is nothing before them; but they are men that eat the flesh, and cast away the hones, as I, who am also a man, have now done. Upon which the king admired at his answer, which was so wisely made; and bid them all make an acclamation, as a mark of their approbation of his jest, which was truly a facetious one. On the next day <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> went to every one of the king's friends, and of the men powerful at court, and saluted them; but still inquired of the servants what present they would make the king on his son's birthday; and when some said that they would give twelve talents, and that others of greater dignity would every one give according to the quantity of their riches, he pretended to every one of them to be grieved that he was not able to bring so large a present; for that he had no more than five talents. And when the servants heard what he said, they told their masters; and they rejoiced in the prospect that Joseph would be disapproved, and would make the king angry, by the smallness of his present. When the day came, the others, even those that brought the most, offered the king not above twenty talents; but <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> gave to every one of the hundred boys and hundred maidens that he had bought a talent apiece, for them to carry, and introduced them, the boys to the king, and the maidens to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>; every body wondering at the unexpected richness of the presents, even the king and queen themselves. He also presented those that attended about the king with gifts to the value of a great number of talents, that he might escape the danger he was in from them; for to these it was that <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> brethren had written to destroy him. Now <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> admired at the young man's magnanimity, and commanded him to ask what gift he pleased. But he desired nothing else to be done for him by the king than to write to his father and brethren about him. So when the king had paid him very great respects, and had given him very large gifts, and had written to his father and his brethren, and all his commanders and officers, about him, he sent him away. But when his brethren heard that <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> had received such favors from the king, and was returning home with great honor, they went out to meet him, and to destroy him, and that with the privity of their father; for he was angry at him for the [large] sum of money that he bestowed for presents, and so had no concern for his preservation. However, Joseph concealed the anger he had at his son, out of fear of the king. And when <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> brethren came to fight him, he slew many others of those that were with them, as also two of his brethren themselves; but the rest of them escaped to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> to their father. But when <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> came to the city, where nobody would receive him, he was afraid for himself, and retired beyond the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a>, and there abode, but obliging the barbarians to pay their taxes. </p>                        </div>

But, upon the death of Joseph, the people grew seditious, on account of his sons. For whereas the elders made war against <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, who was the youngest of Joseph's sons, the multitude was divided, but the greater part joined with the elders in this war; as did <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> the high priest, by reason he was of kin to them.

He also erected a strong castle, and built it entirely of white stone to the very roof, and had animals of a prodigious magnitude engraven upon it. He also drew round it a great and deep canal of water. He also made caves of many furlongs in length, by hollowing a rock that was over against him; and then he made large rooms in it, some for feasting, and some for sleeping and living in. He introduced also a vast quantity of waters which ran along it, and which were very delightful and ornamental in the court. But still he made the entrances at the mouth of the caves so narrow, that no more than one person could enter by them at once. And the reason why he built them after that manner was a good one; it was for his own preservation, lest he should be besieged by his brethren, and run the hazard of being caught by them. Moreover, he built courts of greater magnitude than ordinary, which he adorned with vastly large gardens. And when he had brought the place to this state, he named it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>.

So he left the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> bare, and took away the golden candlesticks, and the golden altar [of incense], and table [of shew-bread], and the altar [of burnt-offering]; and did not abstain from even the veils, which were made of fine linen and scarlet. He also emptied it of its secret treasures, and left nothing at all remaining; and by this means cast the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> into great lamentation, for he forbade them to offer those daily sacrifices which they used to offer to God, according to the law. And when he had pillaged the whole city, some of the inhabitants he slew, and some he carried captive, together with their wives and children, so that the multitude of those captives that were taken alive amounted to about ten thousand. He also burnt down the finest buildings; and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>sanctuary</a>; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the [Jewish] multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. And when the king had built an altar upon the place of sacrifice, he slew <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> upon it, and so offered a sacrifice neither according to the law, nor the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> religious worship in that country. He also compelled them to forsake the worship which they paid their own God, and to adore those whom he took to be gods; and made them build temples, and raise altars in every city and village, and offer <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a> upon them every day. He also commanded them not to circumcise their sons, and threatened to punish any that should be found to have transgressed his injunction. He also appointed overseers, who should compel them to do what he commanded. And indeed many <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> there were who complied with the king's commands, either voluntarily, or out of fear of the penalty that was denounced. But the best men, and those of the noblest souls, did not regard him, but did pay a greater respect to the customs of their country than concern as to the punishment which he threatened to the disobedient; on which account they every day underwent great miseries and bitter torments; for they were whipped with rods, and their bodies were torn to pieces, and were crucified, while they were still alive, and breathed. They also strangled those women and their sons whom they had circumcised, as the king had appointed, hanging their sons about their necks as they were upon the crosses. And if there were any sacred book of the law found, it was destroyed, and those with whom they were found miserably perished also. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/2894 target=_blank>Mattathias</a> said he would not do it; and that if all the other nations would obey the commands of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, either out of fear, or to please him, yet would not he nor his sons leave the religious worship of their country. But as soon as he had ended his speech, there came one of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> into the midst of them, and sacrificed, as <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had commanded. At which <a href=/people/2894 target=_blank>Mattathias</a> had great indignation, and ran upon him violently, with his sons, who had swords with them, and slew both the man himself that sacrificed, and <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a> the king's general, who compelled them to sacrifice, with a few of his soldiers. He also overthrew the idol altar, and cried out, If, said he, any one be zealous for the laws of his country, and for the worship of God, let him follow me. And when he had said this, he made haste into the desert with his sons, and left all his substance in the village. Many others did the same also, and fled with their children and wives into the desert, and dwelt in caves. But when the king's generals heard this, they took all the forces they then had in the citadel at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and pursued the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> into the desert; and when they had overtaken them, they in the first place endeavored to persuade them to repent, and to choose what was most for their advantage, and not put them to the necessity of using them according to the law of war. But when they would not comply with their persuasions, but continued to be of a different mind, they fought against them on the sabbath day, and they burnt them as they were in the caves, without resistance, and without so much as stopping up the entrances of the caves. And they avoided to defend themselves on that day, because they were not willing to break in upon the honor they owed the sabbath, even in such distresses; for our law requires that we rest upon that day. There were about a thousand, with their wives and children, who were smothered and died in these caves; but many of those that escaped joined themselves to <a href=/people/2894 target=_blank>Mattathias</a>, and appointed him to be their ruler, who taught them to fight, even on the sabbath day; and told them that unless they would do so, they would become their own enemies, by observing the law [so rigorously], while their adversaries would still assault them on this day, and they would not then defend themselves, and that nothing could then hinder but they must all perish without fighting. This speech persuaded them. And this rule continues among us to this day, that if there be a necessity, we may fight on sabbath days. So <a href=/people/2894 target=_blank>Mattathias</a> got a great army about him, and overthrew their idol altars, and slew those that broke the laws, even all that he could get under his power; for many of them were dispersed among the nations round about them for fear of him.

So he set them in their ancient order of battle used by their forefathers, under their captains of thousands, and other officers, and dismissed such as were newly married, as well as those that had newly gained possessions, that they might not fight in a cowardly manner, out of an inordinate love of life, in order to enjoy those blessings. When he had thus disposed his soldiers, he encouraged them to fight by the following speech, which he made to them: O my fellow soldiers, no other time remains more opportune than the present for courage and contempt of dangers; for if you now fight manfully, you may recover your liberty, which, as it is a thing of itself agreeable to all men, so it proves to be to us much more desirable, by its affording us the liberty of worshipping God. Since therefore you are in such circumstances at present, you must either recover that liberty, and so regain a happy and blessed way of living, which is that according to our laws, and the customs of our country, or to submit to the most opprobrious sufferings; nor will any seed of your nation remain if you be beat in this battle. Fight therefore manfully; and suppose that you must die, though you do not fight; but believe, that besides such glorious rewards as those of the liberty of your country, of your laws, of your religion, you shall then obtain everlasting glory. Prepare yourselves, therefore, and put yourselves into such an agreeable posture, that you may be ready to fight with the enemy as soon as it is day tomorrow morning. </p>                        </div>

So that when <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> found no enemy in their camp, but suspected that they were retired, and had hidden themselves among the mountains, he resolved to go and seek them wheresoever they were.

So he commanded the trumpeters to sound for the battle; and by thus falling upon the enemies when they did not expect it, and thereby astonishing and disturbing their minds, he slew many of those that resisted him, and went on pursuing the rest as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326356UGad class=place long=35.6781 lat=32.6559>Gadara</a>, and the plains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318347UAzo class=place long=34.656 lat=31.75604>Azotos</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318347UIam class=place long=34.7322 lat=31.878>Iamnia</a>; and of these there fell about three thousand.

And just as he was speaking to his soldiers, <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>'s men looked down into that army which they left in their camp, and saw that it was overthrown, and the camp burnt; for the smoke that arose from it showed them, even when they were a great way off, what had happened. When therefore those that were with <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a> understood that things were in this posture, and perceived that those that were with <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> were ready to fight them, they also were affrighted, and put to flight; but then <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a>, as though he had already beaten <a href=/people/367 target=_blank>Gorgias</a>'s soldiers without fighting, returned and seized on the spoils.

When these misfortunes had often happened to them, <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> resolved to destroy that garrison; whereupon he got all the people together, and vigorously besieged those that were in the citadel. This was in the hundred and fiftieth year of the dominion of the <a href=/people/1597 target=_blank>Seleucidse</a>. So he made engines of war, and erected bulwarks, and very zealously pressed on to take the citadel. But there were not a few of the runagates who were in the place that went out by night into the country, and got together some other wicked men like themselves, and went to <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> the king, and desired of him that he would not suffer them to be neglected, under the great hardships that lay upon them from those of their own nation; and this because their sufferings were occasioned on his father's account, while they left the religious worship of their fathers, and preferred that which he had commanded them to follow: that there was danger lest the citadel, and those appointed to garrison it by the king, should be taken by <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a>, and those that were with him, unless he would send them succors. When <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, who was but a child, heard this, he was angry, and sent for his captains and his friends, and gave order that they should get an army of mercenaries together, with such men also of his own kingdom as were of an age fit for war. Accordingly, an army was collected of about a hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants. </p>                        </div>

But when <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> heard of the king's coming, he raised the siege of the citadel, and met the king, and pitched his camp in certain straits, at a place called Bethzachriah, at the distance of seventy furlongs from the enemy; but the king soon drew his forces from <a href=/people/4094 target=_blank>Bethsura</a>, and brought them to those straits. And as soon as it was day, he put his men in battle-array, and made his elephants follow one another through the narrow passes, because they could not be set sideways by one another. Now round about every elephant there were a thousand footmen, and five hundred horsemen. The elephants also had high towers [upon their backs], and archers [in them]. And he also made the rest of his army to go up the mountains, and put his friends before the rest; and gave orders for the army to shout aloud, and so he attacked the enemy. He also exposed to sight their golden and brazen shields, so that a glorious splendor was sent from them; and when they shouted the mountains echoed again. When <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> saw this, he was not terrified, but received the enemy with great courage, and slew about six hundred of the first ranks. But when his brother <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, whom they called <a href=/people/8934 target=_blank>Auran</a>, saw the tallest of all the elephants armed with royal breastplates, and supposed that the king was upon him, he attacked him with great quickness and bravery.

But when the deserters and the wicked saw that <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and those that were with him lived in the country very quietly, by reason of the peace, they sent to king <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and excited him to send <a href=/people/1441 target=_blank>Bacchides</a> to seize upon <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, which they said was to be done without any trouble, and in one night's time; and that if they fell upon them before they were aware, they might slay them all.

And when <a href=/people/1441 target=_blank>Bacchides</a> saw himself encompassed with enemies, and some of them before and some behind him, he fell into despair and trouble of mind, as confounded at the unexpected ill success of this siege.

Since you have preserved your friendship for us, and when you have been tempted by our enemies, you have not joined yourselves to them, I both commend you for this your fidelity, and exhort you to continue in the same disposition, for which you shall be repaid, and receive rewards from us; for I will free you from the greatest part of the tributes and taxes which you formerly paid to the kings my predecessors, and to myself; and I do now set you free from those tributes which you have ever paid; and besides, I forgive you the tax upon salt, and the value of the crowns which you used to offer to me and instead of the third part of the fruits [of the field], and the half of the fruits of the trees, I relinquish my part of them from this day: and as to the poll-money, which ought to be given me for every head of the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and of the three toparchies that adjoin to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and Peres, that I relinquish to you for this time, and for all time to come. I will also that the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> be holy and inviolable, and free from the tithe, and from the taxes, unto its utmost bounds. And I so far recede from my title to the citadel, as to permit <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> your high priest to possess it, that he may place such a garrison in it as he approves of for fidelity and good-will to himself, that they may keep it for us. I also make free all those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom. I also give order that the beasts of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> be not pressed for our service; and let their sabbaths, and all their festivals, and three days before each of them, be free from any imposition. In the same manner, I set free the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that are inhabitants of my kingdom, and order that no injury be done them. I also give leave to such of them as are willing to list themselves in my army, that they may do it, and those as far as thirty thousand; which <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> soldiers, wheresoever they go, shall have the same pay that my own army hath; and some of them I will place in my garrisons, and some as guards about mine own body, and as rulers over those that are in my court. I give them leave also to use the laws of their forefathers, and to observe them; and I will that they have power over the three toparchies that are added to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>; and it shall be in the power of the high priest to take care that no one <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> shall have any other temple for worship but only that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. I bequeath also, out of my own revenues, yearly, for the expenses about the sacrifices, one hundred and fifty thousand [drachmae]; and what money is to spare, I will that it shall be your own. I also release to you those ten thousand drachmae which the kings received from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, because they appertain to the priests that minister in that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. And whosoever shall fly to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, or to the places thereto belonging, or who owe the king money, or are there on any other account, let them be set free, and let their goods be in safety. I also give you leave to repair and rebuild your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and that all be done at my expenses. I also allow you to build the walls of your city, and to erect high towers, and that they be erected at my charge. And if there be any fortified town that would be convenient for the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> country to have very strong, let it be so built at my expenses. </p>                        </div>

And when it was come to a battle, the left wing of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> put those who opposed them to flight, and pursued them a great way, and slew many of them, and spoiled their camp; but the right wing, where <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> happened to be, was beaten; and as for all the rest, they ran away. But <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> fought courageously, and slew a great many of the enemy; but as he was in the pursuit of the rest, his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> carried him into a deep bog, where it was hard to get out, and there it happened, that upon his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s falling down, he could not escape being killed; for when his enemies saw what had befallen him, they returned back, and encompassed <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> round, and they all threw their darts at him; but he, being now on foot, fought bravely. But at length he received so many wounds, that he was not able to bear up any longer, but fell.

The chief reason why he was desirous so to do, was, that he relied upon the prophet <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a>, who lived above six hundred years before, and foretold that there certainly was to be a temple built to Almighty God in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by a man that was a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a>. <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a> was elevated with this prediction, and wrote the following letter to <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>: Having done many and great things for you in the affairs of the war, by the assistance of God, and that in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, I came at length with the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/306313ULeo class=place long=31.3554 lat=30.683>Leontopolis</a>, and to other places of your nation, where I found that the greatest part of your people had temples in an improper manner, and that on this account they bare ill-will one against another, which happens to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> by reason of the multitude of their temples, and the difference of opinions about Divine worship.

But when <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> was preparing to besiege them, they were afraid he would take them by force, and so they opened the gates to him.

However, <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> sallied out, and pursued <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318347UAzo class=place long=34.656 lat=31.75604>Azotos</a>; but as soon as <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> perceived that his enemy was in the plain, he came back and gave him battle.

But when the enemy grew remiss in throwing their darts from morning till late at night, <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> perceived their weariness, and fell upon the body of men before him; and because his soldiers showed great alacrity, he put the enemy to flight. And when the horsemen saw that the footmen ran away, neither did they stay themselves, but they being very weary, by the duration of the fight till the evening, and their hope from the footmen being quite gone, they basely ran away, and in great confusion also, till they were separated one from another, and scattered over all the plain.

Now the entire multitude of the enemies that fell in the battle, and were consumed in the temple, were eight thousand. When <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> therefore had overcome so great an army, he removed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318347UAzo class=place long=34.656 lat=31.75604>Azotos</a>, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/317345UAsh class=place long=34.5464 lat=31.6601>Askelon</a>; and when he had pitched his camp without the city, the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/317345UAsh class=place long=34.5464 lat=31.6601>Askelon</a> came out and met him, bringing him hospitable presents, and honoring him; so he accepted of their kind intentions, and returned thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> with a great deal of prey, which he brought thence when he conquered his enemies.

So he was honored by him, and received from him the confirmation of his high priesthood, as he had possessed it by the grants of the kings his predecessors. And when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> deserters accused him, <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> was so far from giving credit to them, that when he petitioned him that he would demand no more than three hundred talents for the tribute of all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and the three toparchies of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, and Peraea, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, he complied with the proposal, and gave him a letter confirming all those grants; whose contents were as follows: King <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> his brother, and to the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, sendeth greeting. We have sent you a copy of that letter which we have written to Lasthones our kinsman, that you may know its contents. King Demetrus to <a href=/people/2421 target=_blank>Lasthenes</a> our father, sendeth greeting. I have determined to return thanks, and to show favor to the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, which hath observed the rules of justice in our concerns. Accordingly, I remit to them the three prefectures, Apherims, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/319348ULyd class=place long=34.893 lat=31.9509>Lydda</a>, and Ramatha, which have been added to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, with their appurtenances; as also what the kings my predecessors received from those that offered sacrifices in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and what are due from the fruits of the earth, and of the trees, and what else belongs to us; with the salt-pits, and the crowns that used to be presented to us. Nor shall they be compelled to pay any of those taxes from this time to all futurity. Take care therefore that a copy of this letter be taken, and given to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and be set up in an eminent place of their holy temple.' And these were the contents of this writing. And now when <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> saw that there was peace every where, and that there was no danger, nor fear of war, he disbanded the greatest part of his army, and diminished their pay, and even retained in pay no others than such foreigners as came up with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>, and from the other islands. However, this procured him ill-will and hatred from the soldiers; on whom he bestowed nothing from this time, while the kings before him used to pay them in time of peace as they did before, that they might have their good-will, and that they might be very ready to undergo the difficulties of war, if any occasion should require it. </p>                        </div>

And when they were informed of the assistance that was coming to <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> from <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and considered at the same time that he would raise a numerous army, unless they prevented him, and seized upon him, they took their weapons immediately, and encompassed his palace in the way of a siege, and seizing upon all the ways of getting out, they sought to subdue their king. And when he saw that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> were become his bitter enemies and that they were thus in arms, he took the mercenary soldiers which he had with them, and those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who were sent by <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, and assaulted the Antiochians; but he was overpowered by them, for they were many ten thousands, and was beaten. But when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> saw that the Antiochians were superior, they went up to the top of the palace, and shot at them from thence; and because they were so remote from them by their height, that they suffered nothing on their side, but did great execution on the others, as fighting from such an elevation, they drove them out of the adjoining houses, and immediately set them on fire, whereupon the flame spread itself over the whole city, and burnt it all down. This happened by reason of the closeness of the houses, and because they were generally built of wood. So the Antioehians, when they were not able to help themselves, nor to stop the fire, were put to flight. And as the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> leaped from the top of one house to the top of another, and pursued them after that manner, it thence happened that the pursuit was so very surprising. But when the king saw that the Antiochians were busy in saving their children and their wives, and so did not fight any longer, he fell upon them in the narrow passages, and fought them, and slew a great many of them, till at last they were forced to throw down their arms, and to deliver themselves up to <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. So he forgave them this their insolent behavior, and put an end to the sedition; and when he had given rewards to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> out of the rich spoils he had gotten, and had returned them thanks, as the cause of his victory, he sent them away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, with an ample testimony of the assistance they had afforded him. Yet did he prove an ill man to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> afterward, and broke the promises he had made; and he threatened that he would make war upon him, unless he would pay all that tribute which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation owed to the first kings [of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>]. And this he had done, if <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a> had not hindered him, and diverted his preparations against <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> to a concern for his own preservation; for he now returned out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, with the child <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, for he was yet in age but a youth, and put the diadem on his head; and as the whole forces that had left <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, because they had no pay, came to his assistance, he made war upon <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and joining battle with him, overcame him in the fight, and took from him both his elephants and the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. </p>                        </div>

So when he saw that all his affairs prospered according to his mind, by the providence of God, he sent ambassadors to the Romans, being desirous of renewing that friendship which their nation had with them formerly. He enjoined the same ambassadors, that, as they came back, they should go to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>, and put them in mind of their friendship and kindred. So when the ambassadors came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, they went into their senate, and said what they were commanded by <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> the high priest to say, how he had sent them to confirm their friendship. The senate then confirmed what had been formerly decreed concerning their friendship with the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and gave them letters to carry to all the kings of Asia and Europe, and to the governors of the cities, that they might safely conduct them to their own country. Accordingly, as they returned, they came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, and delivered the letter which they had received of <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> to them; a copy of which here follows: <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> the high priest of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation, and the senate, and body of the people of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, to the ephori, and senate, and people of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, send greeting. If you be well, and both your public and private affairs be agreeable to your mind, it is according to our wishes. We are well also. When in former times an letter was brought to <a href=/people/1053 target=_blank>Onias</a>, who was then our high priest, from <a href=/people/1216 target=_blank>Areus</a>, who at that time was your king, by <a href=/people/3378 target=_blank>Demoteles</a>, concerning the kindred that was between us and you, a copy of which is here subjoined, we both joyfully received the letter, and were well pleased with <a href=/people/3378 target=_blank>Demoteles</a> and <a href=/people/1216 target=_blank>Areus</a>, although we did not need such a demonstration, because we were satisfied about it from the sacred writings yet did not we think fit first to begin the claim of this relation to you, lest we should seem too early in taking to ourselves the glory which is now given us by you. It is a long time since this relation of ours to you hath been renewed; and when we, upon holy and festival days, offer sacrifices to God, we pray to him for your preservation and victory. As to ourselves, although we have had many wars that have compassed us around, by reason of the covetousness of our neighbors, yet did not we determine to be troublesome either to you, or to others that were related to us; but since we have now overcome our enemies, and have occasion to send <a href=/people/1005 target=_blank>Numenius</a> the son of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, and <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> the son of <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a>, who are both honorable men belonging to our senate, to the Romans, we gave them this letter to you also, that they might renew that friendship which is between us.

The reasons why she made this invitation were these: That her friends persuaded her to it, and that she was afraid for herself, in case some of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364339PSel class=place long=33.9165 lat=36.3765>Seleucia</a> should deliver up the city to <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a>. </p>                        </div>

However, his mother spread out her hands, and begged of him that he would not grow remiss on her account, but indulge his indignation so much the more, and that he would do his utmost to take the place quickly, in order to get their enemy under his power, and then to avenge upon him what he had done to those that were dearest to himself; for that death would be to her sweet, though with torment, if that enemy of theirs might but be brought to punishment for his wicked dealings to them. Now when his mother said so, he resolved to take the fortress immediately; but when he saw her beaten, and torn to pieces, his courage failed him, and he could not but sympathize with what his mother suffered, and was thereby overcome.

And when he had burnt the country, he shut up <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> in the city, which he encompassed round with seven encampments; but did just nothing at the first, because of the strength of the walls, and because of the valor of the besieged, although they were once in want of water, which yet they were delivered from by a large shower of rain, which fell at the setting of the <a href=/people/287 target=_blank>Pleiades</a> However, about the north part of the wall, where it happened the city was upon a level with the outward ground, the king raised a hundred towers of three stories high, and placed bodies of soldiers upon them; and as he made his attacks every day, he cut a double ditch, deep and broad, and confined the inhabitants within it as within a wall; but the besieged contrived to make frequent sallies out; and if the enemy were not any where upon their guard, they fell upon them, and did them a great deal of mischief; and if they perceived them, they then retired into the city with ease. But because <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> discerned the inconvenience of so great a number of men in the city, while the provisions were the sooner spent by them, and yet, as is natural to suppose, those great numbers did nothing, he separated the useless part, and excluded them out of the city, and retained that part only which were in the flower of their age, and fit for war. However, <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> would not let those that were excluded go away, who therefore wandering about between the wails, and consuming away by famine, died miserably; but when the feast of tabernacles was at hand, those that were within commiserated their condition, and received them in again.

These have so great a power over the multitude, that when they say any thing against the king, or against the high priest, they are presently believed. Now <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> was a disciple of theirs, and greatly beloved by them. And when he once invited them to a feast, and entertained them very kindly, when he saw them in a good humor, he began to say to them, that they knew he was desirous to be a righteous man, and to do all things whereby he might please God, which was the profession of the Pharisees also. However, he desired, that if they observed him offending in any point, and going out of the right way, they would call him back and correct him. On which occasion they attested to his being entirely virtuous; with which commendation he was well pleased. But still there was one of his guests there, whose name was <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, a man of an ill temper, and delighting in seditious practices. This man said, Since thou desirest to know the truth, if thou wilt be righteous in earnest, lay down the high priesthood, and content thyself with the civil government of the people, And when he desired to know for what cause he ought to lay down the high priesthood, the other replied, We have heard it from old men, that thy mother had been a captive under the reign of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a>. This story was false, and <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> was provoked against him; and all the Pharisees had a very great indignation against him. </p>                        </div>

He told <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> that <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a> had cast such a reproach upon him, according to the common sentiments of all the Pharisees, and that this would be made manifest if he would but ask them the question, What punishment they thought this man deserved? for that he might depend upon it, that the reproach was not laid on him with their approbation, if they were for punishing him as his crime deserved. So the Pharisees made answer, that he deserved stripes and bonds, but that it did not seem right to punish reproaches with death. And indeed the Pharisees, even upon other occasions, are not apt to be severe in punishments. At this gentle sentence, <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> was very angry, and thought that this man reproached him by their approbation. It was this <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> who chiefly irritated him, and influenced him so far, that he made him leave the party of the Pharisees, and abolish the decrees they had imposed on the people, and to punish those that observed them. From this source arose that hatred which he and his sons met with from the multitude: but of these matters we shall speak hereafter. What I would now explain is this, that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which are not written in the laws of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>; and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject them, and say that we are to esteem those observances to be obligatory which are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers. And concerning these things it is that great disputes and differences have arisen among them, while the Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich, and have not the populace obsequious to them, but the Pharisees have the multitude on their side. But about these two sects, and that of the <a href=/people/3171 target=_blank>Essens</a>, I have treated accurately in the second book of <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> affairs. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> loved his next brother <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, and treated him as his equal; but the others he held in bonds.

He also proceeded to that degree of barbarity, as to kill her in prison with hunger; nay, he was alienated from his brother <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> by calumnies, and added him to the rest whom he slew; yet he seemed to have an affection for him, and made him above the rest a partner with him in the kingdom. Those calumnies he at first did not give credit to, partly because he loved him, and so did not give heed to what was said against him, and partly because he thought the reproaches were derived from the envy of the relaters.

He first of all came to Agaba, where was Galestes, one of the potent men before mentioned, and was received by him. When it was day, the queen perceived that <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> was fled; and for some time she supposed that his departure was not in order to make any innovation; but when messengers came one after another with the news that he had secured the first place, the second place, and all the places, for as soon as one had begun they all submitted to his disposal, then it was that the queen and the nation were in the greatest disorder, for they were aware that it would not be long ere <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> would be able to settle himself firmly in the government. What they were principally afraid of was this, that he would inflict punishment upon them for the mad treatment his house had had from them. So they resolved to take his wife and children into custody, and keep them in the fortress that was over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. Now there was a mighty conflux of people that came to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> from all parts, insomuch that he had a kind of royal attendants about him; for in a little more than fifteen days he got twenty-two strong places, which gave him the opportunity of raising an army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329364RTra class=place long=36.4 lat=32.9>Trachonitis</a>, and the monarchs; for men are easily led by the greater number, and easily submit to them. And besides this, that by affording him their assistance, when he could not expect it, they, as well as he, should have the advantages that would come by his being king, because they had been the occasion of his gaining the kingdom. Now the eiders of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> with them, went in unto the queen, and desired that she would give them her sentiments about the present posture of affairs, for that <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> was in effect lord of almost all the kingdom, by possessing of so many strong holds, and that it was absurd for them to take any counsel by themselves, how ill soever she were, whilst she was alive, and that the danger would be upon them in no long time. But she bid them do what they thought proper to be done; that they had many circumstances in their favor still remaining, a nation in good heart, an army, and money in their several treasuries; for that she had small concern about public affairs now, when the strength of her body already failed her. </p>                        </div>

However, she brought the affairs of her house to such an unfortunate condition, that she was the occasion of the taking away that authority from it, and that in no long time afterward, which she had obtained by a vast number of hazards and misfortunes, and this out of a desire of what does not belong to a woman, and all by a compliance in her sentiments with those that bare ill-will to their family, and by leaving the administration destitute of a proper support of great men; and, indeed, her management during her administration while she was alive, was such as filled the palace after her death with calamities and disturbance.

And when, upon his refusal, and the excuses that he made, he was still by the multitude compelled to speak, he stood up in the midst of them, and said, O God, the King of the whole world! since those that stand now with me are thy people, and those that are besieged are also thy priests, I beseech thee, that thou wilt neither hearken to the prayers of those against these, nor bring to effect what these pray against those. Whereupon such wicked <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> as stood about him, as soon as he had made this prayer, stoned him to death. </p>                        </div>

Hereupon <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> repented of what he was doing, and came to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, had [promised to] give him money, and received him into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and desired that he would leave off the war, and do what he pleased peaceably. So <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, upon his entreaty, forgave him, and sent <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, and soldiers with him, to receive the money and the city: yet was no part of this performed; but <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> came back, being both excluded out of the city, and receiving none of the money promised, because <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>'s soldiers would not permit the agreements to be executed. At this <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was very angry, and put <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> into prison, and came himself to the city, which was strong on every side, excepting the north, which was not so well fortified, for there was a broad and deep ditch that encompassed the city and included within it the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, which was itself encompassed about with a very strong stone wall. </p>                        </div>

Now these prevented the others, and seized upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and cut off the bridge which reached from it to the city, and prepared themselves to abide a siege; but the others admitted <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s army in, and delivered up both the city and the king's palace to him. So <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> sent his lieutenant <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> with an army, and placed garrisons both in the city and in the palace, to secure them, and fortified the houses that joined to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and all those which were more distant and without it. And in the first place, he offered terms of accommodation to those within; but when they would not comply with what was desired, he encompassed all the places thereabout with a wall, wherein <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> did gladly assist him on all occasions; but <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> pitched his camp within [the wall], on the north part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, where it was most practicable; but even on that side there were great towers, and a ditch had been dug, and a deep valley begirt it round about, for on the parts towards the city were precipices, and the bridge on which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had gotten in was broken down. However, a bank was raised, day by day, with a great deal of labor, while the Romans cut down materials for it from the places round about. And when this bank was sufficiently raised, and the ditch filled up, though but poorly, by reason of its immense depth, he brought his mechanical engines and battering-rams from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and placing them on the bank, he battered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> with the stones that were thrown against it. And had it not been our practice, from the days of our forefathers, to rest on the seventh day, this bank could never have been perfected, by reason of the opposition the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> would have made; for though our law gives us leave then to defend ourselves against those that begin to fight with us and assault us, yet does it not permit us to meddle with our enemies while they do any thing else. </p>                        </div>

And any one may hence learn how very great piety we exercise towards God, and the observance of his laws, since the priests were not at all hindered from their sacred ministrations by their fear during this siege, but did still twice a-day, in the morning and about the ninth hour, offer their sacrifices on the altar; nor did they omit those sacrifices, if any melancholy accident happened by the stones that were thrown among them; for although the city was taken on the third month, on the day of the fast, upon the hundred and seventy-ninth Olympiad, when Caius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Tullius Cicero</a> were consuls, and the enemy then fell upon them, and cut the throats of those that were in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>; yet could not those that offered the sacrifices be compelled to run away, neither by the fear they were in of their own lives, nor by the number that were already slain, as thinking it better to suffer whatever came upon them, at their very altars, than to omit any thing that their laws required of them.

Nor is the largeness of these sums without its attestation; nor is that greatness owing to our vanity, as raising it without ground to so great a height; but there are many witnesses to it, and particularly <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=person long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, who says thus: <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, and took the money which queen <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> had deposited there, as also eight hundred talents belonging to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. Now we have no public money but only what appertains to God; and it is evident that the Asian <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> removed this money out of fear of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>; for it is not probable that those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, who had a strong city and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, should send their money to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>; nor is it likely that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who are inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> should do so neither, since they were ill no fear of <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>. And <a href=/people/911 target=_blank>Strabo</a> himself bears witness to the same thing in another place, that at the same time that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sylla</a> passed over into Greece, in order to fight against <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, he sent <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> to put an end to a sedition that our nation, of whom the habitable earth is full, had raised in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>; where he speaks thus: There were four classes of men among those of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>; that of citizens, that of husbandmen, the third of strangers, and the fourth of <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. Now these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> are already gotten into all cities; and it is hard to find a place in the habitable earth that hath not admitted this tribe of men, and is not possessed by them; and it hath come to pass that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, as having the same governors, and a great number of other nations, imitate their way of living, and maintain great bodies of these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in a peculiar manner, and grow up to greater prosperity with them, and make use of the same laws with that nation also. Accordingly, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> have places assigned them in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, wherein they inhabit, besides what is peculiarly allotted to this nation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, which is a large part of that city. There is also an ethnarch allowed them, who governs the nation, and distributes justice to them, and takes care of their contracts, and of the laws to them belonging, as if he were the ruler of a free republic. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, therefore, this nation is powerful, because the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were originally <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and because the land wherein they inhabit, since they went thence, is near to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. They also removed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a>, because that this land adjoined to the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, as well as does <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, or rather was formerly under the same government.

It therefore pleased [the senate] to make a league of friendship and good-will with them, and to bestow on them whatsoever they stood in need of, and to accept of the shield which was brought by them.

Accordingly he came; but his father had persuaded him to come not like a private man, but with a guard, for the security of his person; and that when he had settled the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a> in the best manner he could for his own advantage, he should come to his trial, but still with a body of men sufficient for his security on his journey, yet so that he should not come with so great a force as might look like terrifying <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, but still such a one as might not expose him naked and unguarded [to his enemies.] However, Sextus <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, wrote to <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, and desired him to clear <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and dismiss him at his trial, and threatened him beforehand if he did not do it. Which letter of his was the occasion of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> delivering <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> from suffering any harm from the <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a>, for he loved him as his own son.

When affairs stood thus, one whose name was <a href=/people/5954 target=_blank>Sameas</a>, a righteous man he was, and for that reason above all fear, rose up, and said, O you that are assessors with me, and O thou that art our king, I neither have ever myself known such a case, nor do I suppose that any one of you can name its parallel, that one who is called to take his trial by us ever stood in such a manner before us; but every one, whosoever he be, that comes to be tried by this <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a>, presents himself in a submissive manner, and like one that is in fear of himself, and that endeavors to move us to compassion, with his hair dishevelled, and in a black and mourning garment: but this admirable man <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who is accused of murder, and called to answer so heavy an accusation, stands here clothed in purple, and with the hair of his head finely trimmed, and with his armed men about him, that if we shall condemn him by our law, he may slay us, and by overbearing justice may himself escape death. Yet do not I make this complaint against <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> himself; he is to be sure more concerned for himself than for the laws; but my complaint is against yourselves, and your king, who gave him a license so to do. However, take you notice, that God is great, and that this very man, whom you are going to absolve and dismiss, for the sake of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, will one day punish both you and your king himself also. Nor did <a href=/people/5954 target=_blank>Sameas</a> mistake in any part of this prediction; for when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had received the kingdom, he slew all the members of this <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a>, and <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> himself also, excepting <a href=/people/5954 target=_blank>Sameas</a>, for he had a great honor for him on account of his righteousness, and because, when the city was afterward besieged by <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> and <a href=/people/1852 target=_blank>Sosius</a>, he persuaded the people to admit <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> into it; and told them that for their sins they would not be able to escape his hands: — which things will be related by us in their proper places. </p>                        </div>

So he retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, as though he fled from the king; and when he had been with Sextus <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and had put his own affairs in a sure posture, he resolved to do thus; that in case he were again summoned before the <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a> to take his trial, he would not obey that summons. Hereupon the members of the <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a> had great indignation at this posture of affairs, and endeavored to persuade <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> that all these things were against him; which state of matters he was not ignorant of; but his temper was so unmanly, and so foolish, that he was able to do nothing at all. But when Sextus had made <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> general of the army of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a>, for he sold him that post for money, <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> was in fear lest <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> should make war upon him; nor was the effect of what he feared long in coming upon him; for <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> came and brought an army along with him to fight with <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, as being angry at the trial he bad been summoned to undergo before the <a href=/people/3245 target=_blank>Sanhedrim</a>; but his father <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, and his brother [<a href=/people/1335 target=_blank>Phasaelus</a>], met him, and hindered him from assaulting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. They also pacified his vehement temper, and persuaded him to do no overt action, but only to affright them with threatenings, and to proceed no further against one who had given him the dignity he had: they also desired him not only to be angry that he was summoned, and obliged to come to his trial, but to remember withal how he was dismissed without condemnation, and how he ought to give <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> thanks for the same; and that he was not to regard only what was disagreeable to him, and be unthankful for his deliverance. So they desired him to consider, that since it is God that turns the scales of war, there is great uncertainty in the issue of battles, and that therefore he ought of to expect the victory when he should fight with his king, and him that had supported him, and bestowed many benefits upon him, and had done nothing itself very severe to him; for that his accusation, which was derived from evil counselors, and not from himself, had rather the suspicion of some severity, than any thing really severe in it. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was persuaded by these arguments, and believed that it was sufficient for his future hopes to have made a show of his strength before the nation, and done no more to it — and in this state were the affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> at this time. </p>                        </div>

I am therefore satisfied, both by your actions and your words, that you are well-disposed to us; and I understand that your conduct of life is constant and religious: so I reckon upon you as our own. But when those that were adversaries to you, and to the Roman people, abstained neither from cities nor temples, and did not observe the agreement they had confirmed by oath, it was not only on account of our contest with them, but on account of all mankind in common, that we have taken vengeance on those who have been the authors of great injustice towards men, and of great wickedness towards the gods; for the sake of which we suppose it was that the sun turned away his light from us, as unwilling to view the horrid crime they were guilty of in the case of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. We have also overcome their conspiracies, which threatened the gods themselves, which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> received, as it is a climate peculiarly proper for impious and insolent attempts; and we have overcome that confused rout of men, half mad with spite against us, which they got together at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, when they seized on the places that were proper for their purpose, and, as it were, walled them round with mountains to the very sea, and where the passage was open only through a single gate. This victory we gained, because the gods had condemned those men for their wicked enterprises. Now <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, when he had fled as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410243PPhi class=place long=24.285 lat=41.012>Philippi</a>, was shut up by us, and became a partaker of the same perdition with <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>; and now these have received their punishment, we suppose that we may enjoy peace for the time to come, and that Asia may be at rest from war. We therefore make that peace which God hath given us common to our confederates also, insomuch that the body of Asia is now recovered out of that distemper it was under by the means of our victory. I, therefore, bearing in mind both thee and your nation, shall take care of what may be for your advantage. I have also sent letters in writing to the several cities, that if any persons, whether free-men or bond-men, have been sold under the spear by Caius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, or his subordinate officers, they may be set free. And I will that you kindly make use of the favors which I and <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> have granted you. I also forbid the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> to use any violence with you; and for what places of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> they now possess, I order them to restore them.

So the king left a garrison at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a>, and came back again, and sent the Roman army to take their winter quarters in the countries that were come over to him, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>.

These caves were in mountains that were exceeding abrupt, and in their middle were no other than precipices, with certain entrances into the caves, and those caves were encompassed with sharp rocks, and in these did the robbers lie concealed, with all their families about them; but the king caused certain chests to be made, in order to destroy them, and to be hung down, bound about with iron chains, by an engine, from the top of the mountain, it being not possible to get up to them, by reason of the sharp ascent of the mountains, nor to creep down to them from above. Now these chests were filled with armed men, who had long hooks in their hands, by which they might pull out such as resisted them, and then tumble them down, and kill them by so doing; but the letting the chests down proved to be a matter of great danger, because of the vast depth they were to be let down, although they had their provisions in the chests themselves. But when the chests were let down, and not one of those in the mouths of the caves durst come near them, but lay still out of fear, some of the armed men girt on their armor, and by both their hands took hold of the chain by which the chests were let down, and went into the mouths of the caves, because they fretted that such delay was made by the robbers not daring to come out of the caves; and when they were at any of those mouths, they first killed many of those that were in the mouths with their darts, and afterwards pulled those to them that resisted them with their hooks, and tumbled them down the precipices, and afterwards went into the caves, and killed many more, and then went into their chests again, and lay still there; but, upon this, terror seized the rest, when they heard the lamentations that were made, and they despaired of escaping. However, when the night came on, that put an end to the whole work; and as the king proclaimed pardon by a herald to such as delivered themselves up to him, many accepted of the offer. The same method of assault was made use of the next day; and they went further, and got out in baskets to fight them, and fought them at their doors, and sent fire among them, and set their caves on fire, for there was a great deal of combustible matter within them. Now there was one old man who was caught within one of these caves, with seven children and a wife; these prayed him to give them leave to go out, and yield themselves up to the enemy; but he stood at the cave's mouth, and always slew that child of his who went out, till he had destroyed them every one, and after that he slew his wife, and cast their dead bodies down the precipice, and himself after them, and so underwent death rather than slavery: but before he did this, he greatly reproached <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> with the meanness of his family, although he was then king. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> also saw what he was doing, and stretched out his hand, and offered him all manner of security for his life; by which means all these caves were at length subdued entirely. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> understood this, he opposed ambushes in the fittest places against their private robberies, and he sent legions of armed men to bring its provisions, and that from remote places, so that in a little time they had great plenty of provisions. Now the three bulwarks were easily erected, because so many hands were continually at work upon it; for it was summer time, and there was nothing to hinder them in raising their works, neither from the air nor from the workmen; so they brought their engines to bear, and shook the walls of the city, and tried all manner of ways to get its; yet did not those within discover any fear, but they also contrived not a few engines to oppose their engines withal. They also sallied out, and burnt not only those engines that were not yet perfected, but those that were; and when they came hand to hand, their attempts were not less bold than those of the Romans, though they were behind them in skill. They also erected new works when the former were ruined, and making mines underground, they met each other, and fought there; and making use of brutish courage rather than of prudent valor, they persisted in this war to the very last; and this they did while a mighty army lay round about them, and while they were distressed by famine and the want of necessaries, for this happened to be a Sabbatic year.

And thus did the government of the Asamoneans cease, a hundred twenty and six years after it was first set up. This family was a splendid and an illustrious one, both on account of the nobility of their stock, and of the dignity of the high priesthood, as also for the glorious actions their ancestors had performed for our nation; but these men lost the government by their dissensions one with another, and it came to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, the son of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, who was of no more than a vulgar family, and of no eminent extraction, but one that was subject to other kings.

But <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a> the Pharisee, and <a href=/people/5954 target=_blank>Sameas</a>, a disciple of his, were honored by him above all the rest; for when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was besieged, they advised the citizens to receive <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, for which advice they were well requited.

He also slew forty-five of the principal men of <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>'s party, and set guards at the gates of the city, that nothing might be carried out together with their dead bodies. They also searched the dead, and whatsoever was found, either of silver or gold, or other treasure, it was carried to the king; nor was there any end of the miseries he brought upon them; and this distress was in part occasioned by the covetousness of the prince regent, who was still in want of more, and in part by the Sabbatic year, which was still going on, and forced the country to lie still uncultivated, since we are forbidden to sow our land in that year. Now when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had received <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> as his captive, he determined to keep him against his triumph; but when he heard that the nation grew seditious, and that, out of their hatred to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, they continued to bear good-will to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, he resolved to behead him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, for otherwise the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> could no way be brought to be quiet.

And she desired him to excuse her, if the nobility of her family, and that freedom of acting which she thought that allowed her, had made her act too precipitately and imprudently in this matter.

Her guards also were so careful, that nothing she did in private life every day was concealed. All these hardships put her out of patience, by little and little and she began to hate <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>; for as she had the pride of a woman to the utmost degree, she had great indignation at this suspicious guard that was about her, as desirous rather to undergo any thing that could befall her, than to be deprived of her liberty of speech, and, under the notion of an honorary guard, to live in a state of slavery and terror. She therefore sent to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, and made a long complaint of the circumstances she was in, and entreated her to do her utmost for her assistance. <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> hereupon advised her to take her son with her, and come away immediately to her into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.

They at once rejoiced and were confounded, and mingled with good wishes their joyful acclamations which they made to him, till the good-will of the multitude was made too evident; and they more rashly proclaimed the happiness they had received from his family than was fit under a monarchy to have done. Upon all this, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> resolved to complete what he had intended against the young man.

Now the nature of that place was hotter than ordinary; so they went out in a body, and of a sudden, and in a vein of madness; and as they stood by the fish-ponds, of which there were large ones about the house, they went to cool themselves [by bathing], because it was in the midst of a hot day. At first they were only spectators of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s servants and acquaintance as they were swimming; but after a while, the young man, at the instigation of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, went into the water among them, while such of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s acquaintance, as he had appointed to do it, dipped him as he was swimming, and plunged him under water, in the dark of the evening, as if it had been done in sport only; nor did they desist till he was entirely suffocated.

Her sorrow was greater than that of others, by her knowing how the murder was committed; but she was under the necessity of bearing up under it, out of her prospect of a greater mischief that might otherwise follow; and she oftentimes came to an inclination to kill herself with her own hand, but still she restrained herself, in hopes she might live long enough to revenge the unjust murder thus privately committed; nay, she further resolved to endeavor to live longer, and to give no occasion to think she suspected that her son was slain on purpose, and supposed that she might thereby be in a capacity of revenging it at a proper opportunity. Thus did she restrain herself, that she might not be noted for entertaining any such suspicion. However, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> endeavored that none abroad should believe that the child's death was caused by any design of his; and for this purpose he did not only use the ordinary signs of sorrow, but fell into tears also, and exhibited a real confusion of soul; and perhaps his affections were overcome on this occasion, when he saw the child's countenance so young and so beautiful, although his death was supposed to tend to his own security. So far at least this grief served as to make some apology for him; and as for his funeral, that he took care should be very magnificent, by making great preparation for a sepulcher to lay his body in, and providing a great quantity of spices, and burying many ornaments together with him, till the very women, who were in such deep sorrow, were astonished at it, and received in this way some consolation. </p>                        </div>

The reason of her saying so was this, that she for a long time bare her ill-will; for when they had differences with one another, <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> took great freedoms, and reproached the rest for the meanness of their birth. But <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, whose affection to <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> was always very warm, was presently disturbed at this, and could not bear the torments of jealousy, but was still restrained from doing any rash thing to her by the love he had for her; yet did his vehement affection and jealousy together make him ask <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> by herself about this matter of Joseph; but she denied it upon her oath, and said all that an innocent woman could possibly say in her own defense; so that by little and little the king was prevailed upon to drop the suspicion, and left off his anger at her; and being overcome with his passion for his wife, he made an apology to her for having seemed to believe what he had heard about her, and returned her a great many acknowledgments of her modest behavior, and professed the extraordinary affection and kindness he had for her, till at last, as is usual between lovers, they both fell into tears, and embraced one another with a most tender affection. But as the king gave more and more assurances of his belief of her fidelity, and endeavored to draw her to a like confidence in him, <a href=/people/7928 target=_blank>Marianme</a> said, Yet was not that command thou gavest, that if any harm came to thee from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, I, who had been no occasion of it, should perish with thee, a sign of thy love to me? When these words were fallen from her, the king was shocked at them, and presently let her go out of his arms, and cried out, and tore his hair with his own hands, and said, that now he had an evident demonstration that Joseph had had criminal conversation with his wife; for that he would never have uttered what he had told him alone by himself, unless there had been such a great familiarity and firm confidence between them. And while he was in this passion he had like to have killed his wife; but being still overborne by his love to her, he restrained this his passion, though not without a lasting grief and disquietness of mind. However, he gave order to slay Joseph, without permitting him to come into his sight; and as for <a href=/people/1106 target=_blank>Alexandra</a>, he bound her, and kept her in custody, as the cause of all this mischief. </p>                        </div>

She was also by nature very covetous, and stuck at no wickedness. She had already poisoned her brother, because she knew that he was to be king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and this when he was but fifteen years old; and she got her sister <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> to be slain, by the means of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, when she was a supplicant at <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379274SEph class=place long=27.364 lat=37.949>temple</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>; for if there were but any hopes of getting money, she would violate both temples and sepulchers. Nor was there any holy place that was esteemed the most inviolable, from which she would not fetch the ornaments it had in it; nor any place so profane, but was to suffer the most flagitious treatment possible from her, if it could but contribute somewhat to the covetous humor of this wicked creature: yet did not all this suffice so extravagant a woman, who was a slave to her lusts, but she still imagined that she wanted every thing she could think of, and did her utmost to gain it; for which reason she hurried <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> on perpetually to deprive others of their dominions, and give them to her. And as she went over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> with him, she contrived to get it into her possession; so he slew <a href=/people/1783 target=_blank>Lysanias</a>, the son of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, accusing him of his bringing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> upon those countries.

As for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, he was so entirely overcome by this woman, that one would not think her conversation only could do it, but that he was some way or other bewitched to do whatsoever she would have him; yet did the grossest parts of her injustice make him so ashamed, that he would not always hearken to her to do those flagrant enormities she would have persuaded him to. That therefore he might not totally deny her, nor, by doing every thing which she enjoined him, appear openly to be an ill man, he took some parts of each of those countries away from their former governors, and gave them to her.

This country bears that balsam, which is the most precious drug that is there, and grows there alone. The place bears also palm trees, both many in number, and those excellent in their kind. When she was there, and was very often with <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, she endeavored to have criminal conversation with the king; nor did she affect secrecy in the indulgence of such sort of pleasures; and perhaps she had in some measure a passion of love to him; or rather, what is most probable, she laid a treacherous snare for him, by aiming to obtain such adulterous conversation from him: however, upon the whole, she seemed overcome with love to him. Now <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had a great while borne no good-will to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, as knowing that she was a woman irksome to all; and at that time he thought her particularly worthy of his hatred, if this attempt proceeded out of lust; he had also thought of preventing her intrigues, by putting her to death, if such were her endeavors. However, he refused to comply with her proposals, and called a counsel of his friends to consult with them whether he should not kill her, now he had her in his power; for that he should thereby deliver all those from a multitude of evils to whom she was already become irksome, and was expected to be still so for the time to come; and that this very thing would be much for the advantage of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> himself, since she would certainly not be faithful to him, in case any such season or necessity should come upon him as that he should stand in need of her fidelity. But when he thought to follow this advice, his friends would not let him; and told him that, in the first place, it was not right to attempt so great a thing, and run himself thereby into the utmost danger; and they laid hard at him, and begged of him to undertake nothing rashly, for that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> would never bear it, no, not though any one should evidently lay before his eyes that it was for his own advantage; and that the appearance of depriving him of her conversation, by this violent and treacherous method, would probably set his affections more on a flame than before. Nor did it appear that he could offer any thing of tolerable weight in his defense, this attempt being against such a woman as was of the highest dignity of any of her sex at that time in the world; and as to any advantage to be expected from such an undertaking, if any such could be supposed in this case, it would appear to deserve condemnation, on account of the insolence he must take upon him in doing it: which considerations made it very plain that in so doing he would find his government filled with mischief, both great and lasting, both to himself and his posterity, whereas it was still in his power to reject that wickedness she would persuade him to, and to come off honorably at the same time. So by thus affrighting <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and representing to him the hazard he must, in all probability, run by this undertaking, they restrained him from it. So he treated <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> kindly, and made her presents, and conducted her on her way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. </p>                        </div>

So he fell upon the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> unexpectedly, when they were fatigued, and thought they had already vanquished the enemy, and made a great slaughter of them; for as the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had spent their courage upon their known enemies, and were about to enjoy themselves in quietness after their victory, they were easily beaten by these that attacked them afresh, and in particular received a great loss in places where the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> could not be of service, and which were very stony, and where those that attacked them were better acquainted with the places than themselves. And when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had suffered this loss, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> raised their spirits after their defeat, and returning back again, slew those that were already put to flight; and indeed all sorts of slaughter were now frequent, and of those that escaped, a few only returned into the camp. So king <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, when he despaired of the battle, rode up to them to bring them assistance; yet did he not come time enough to do them any service, though he labored hard to do it; but the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> camp was taken; so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> had unexpectedly a most glorious success, having gained that victory which of themselves they were no way likely to have gained, and slaying a great part of the enemy's army: whence afterward <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> could only act like a private robber, and make excursions upon many parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, and distress them by sudden incursions, while he encamped among the mountains, and avoided by any means to come to a pitched battle; yet did he greatly harass the enemy by his assiduity, and the hard labor he took in this matter. He also took great care of his own forces, and used all the means he could to restore his affairs to their old state. </p>                        </div>

About ten thousand men also perished by the fall of houses; but the army, which lodged in the field, received no damage by this sad accident.

Accordingly, they took the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> ambassadors, who came to them after all this had happened, to make peace with them, and slew them, and came with great alacrity against their army; but the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> durst not withstand them, and were so cast down by the calamities they were under, that they took no care of their affairs, but gave up themselves to despair; for they had no hope that they should be upon a level again with them in battles, nor obtain any assistance elsewhere, while their affairs at home were in such great distress also. When matters were in this condition, the king persuaded the commanders by his words, and tried to raise their spirits, which were quite sunk; and first he endeavored to encourage and embolden some of the better sort beforehand, and then ventured to make a speech to the multitude, which he had before avoided to do, lest he should find them uneasy thereat, because of the misfortunes which had happened; so he made a consolatory speech to the multitude, in the manner following: </p>                        </div>

I will then, in the first place, demonstrate to you that this war is a just one on our side, and that on this account it is a war of necessity, and occasioned by the injustice of our adversaries; for if you be once satisfied of this, it will be a real cause of alacrity to you; after which I will further demonstrate, that the misfortunes we are under are of no great consequence, and that we have the greatest reason to hope for victory. I shall begin with the first, and appeal to yourselves as witnesses to what I shall say. You are not ignorant certainly of the wickedness of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, which is to that degree as to appear incredible to all other men, and to include somewhat that shows the grossest barbarity and ignorance of God. The chief things wherein they have affronted us have arisen from covetousness and envy; and they have attacked us in an insidious manner, and on the sudden. And what occasion is there for me to mention many instances of such their procedure? When they were in danger of losing their own government of themselves, and of being slaves to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, what others were they that freed them from that fear? for it was the friendship. I had with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and the kind disposition he was in towards us, that hath been the occasion that even these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> have not been utterly undone, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> being unwilling to undertake any thing which might be suspected by us of unkindness: but when he had a mind to bestow some parts of each of our dominions on <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, I also managed that matter so, that by giving him presents of my own, I might obtain a security to both nations, while I undertook myself to answer for the money, and gave him two hundred talents, and became surety for those two hundred more which were imposed upon the land that was subject to this tribute; and this they have defrauded us of, although it was not reasonable that <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> should pay tribute to any man living, or allow part of their land to be taxable; but although that was to be, yet ought we not to pay tribute for these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, whom we have ourselves preserved; nor is it fit that they, who have professed (and that with great integrity and sense of our kindness) that it is by our means that they keep their principality, should injure us, and deprive us of what is our due, and this while we have been still not their enemies, but their friends. And whereas observation of covenants takes place among the bitterest enemies, but among friends is absolutely necessary, this is not observed among these men, who think gain to be the best of all things, let it be by any means whatsoever, and that injustice is no harm, if they may but get money by it: is it therefore a question with you, whether the unjust are to be punished or not? when God himself hath declared his mind that so it ought to be, and hath commanded that we ever should hate injuries and injustice, which is not only just, but necessary, in wars between several nations; for these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> have done what both the Greeks and barbarians own to be an instance of the grossest wickedness, with regard to our ambassadors, which they have beheaded, while the Greeks declare that such ambassadors are sacred and inviolable. And for ourselves, we have learned from God the most excellent of our doctrines, and the most holy part of our law, by angels or ambassadors; for this name brings God to the knowledge of mankind, and is sufficient to reconcile enemies one to another. What wickedness then can be greater than the slaughter of ambassadors, who come to treat about doing what is right? And when such have been their actions, how is it possible they can either live securely in common life, or be successful in war? In my opinion, this is impossible; but perhaps some will say, that what is holy, and what is righteous, is indeed on our side, but that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> are either more courageous or more numerous than we are. Now, as to this, in the first place, it is not fit for us to say so, for with whom is what is righteous, with them is God himself; now where God is, there is both multitude and courage. But to examine our own circumstances a little, we were conquerors in the first battle; and when we fought again, they were not able to oppose us, but ran away, and could not endure our attacks or our courage; but when we had conquered them, then came <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenion</a>, and made war against us without declaring it; and pray, is this an instance of their manhood? or is it not a second instance of their wickedness and treachery? Why are we therefore of less courage, on account of that which ought to inspire us with stronger hopes? and why are we terrified at these, who, when they fight upon the level, are continually beaten, and when they seem to be conquerors, they gain it by wickedness? and if we suppose that any one should deem them to be men of real courage, will not he be excited by that very consideration to do his utmost against them? for true valor is not shown by fighting against weak persons, but in being able to overcome the most hardy. But then if the distresses we are ourselves under, and the miseries that have come by the earthquake, hath affrighted any one, let him consider, in the first place, that this very thing will deceive the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, by their supposal that what hath befallen us is greater than it really is. Moreover, it is not right that the same thing that emboldens them should discourage us; for these men, you see, do not derive their alacrity from any advantageous virtue of their own, but from their hope, as to us, that we are quite cast down by our misfortunes; but when we boldly march against them, we shall soon pull down their insolent conceit of themselves, and shall gain this by attacking them, that they will not be so insolent when we come to the battle; for our distresses are not so great, nor is what hath happened all indication of the anger of God against us, as some imagine; for such things are accidental, and adversities that come in the usual course of things; and if we allow that this was done by the will of God, we must allow that it is now over by his will also, and that he is satisfied with what hath already happened; for had he been willing to afflict us still more thereby, he had not changed his mind so soon. And as for the war we are engaged in, he hath himself demonstrated that he is willing it should go on, and that he knows it to be a just war; for while some of the people in the country have perished, all you who were in arms have suffered nothing, but are all preserved alive; whereby God makes it plain to us, that if you had universally, with your children and wives, been in the army, it had come to pass that you had not undergone any thing that would have much hurt you. Consider these things, and, what is more than all the rest, that you have God at all times for your Protector; and prosecute these men with a just bravery, who, in point of friendship, are unjust, in their battles perfidious, towards ambassadors impious, and always inferior to you in valor. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, when he had offered the sacrifices appointed by the law made haste, and took them, and led them against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>; and in order to that passed over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a>, and pitched his camp near to that of the enemy. He also thought fit to seize upon a certain castle that lay in the midst of them, as hoping it would be for his advantage, and would the sooner produce a battle; and that if there were occasion for delay, he should by it have his camp fortified; and as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> had the same intentions upon that place, a contest arose about it; at first they were but skirmishes, after which there came more soldiers, and it proved a sort of fight, and some fell on both sides, till those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> side were beaten and retreated. This was no small encouragement to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> immediately; and when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> observed that the enemy's army was disposed to any thing rather than to come to an engagement, he ventured boldly to attempt the bulwark itself, and to pull it to pieces, and so to get nearer to their camp, in order to fight them; for when they were forced out of their trenches, they went out in disorder, and had not the least alacrity, or hope of victory; yet did they fight hand to hand, because they were more in number than the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and because they were in such a disposition of war that they were under a necessity of coming on boldly; so they came to a terrible battle, while not a few fell on each side. However, at length the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> fled; and so great a slaughter was made upon their being routed, that they were not only killed by their enemies, but became the authors of their own deaths also, and were trodden down by the multitude, and the great current of people in disorder, and were destroyed by their own armor; so five thousand men lay dead upon the spot, while the rest of the multitude soon ran within the bulwark for safety, but had no firm hope of safety, by reason of their want of necessaries, and especially of water. The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> pursued them, but could not get in with them, but sat round about the bulwark, and watched any assistance that would get in to them, and prevented any there, that had a mind to it, from running away. </p>                        </div>

So they were necessitated by other motives, and particularly by their thirst, to come out, and deliver themselves up to him, to be carried away captives; and in five days' time the number of four thousand were taken prisoners, while all the rest resolved to make a sally upon their enemies, and to fight it out with them, choosing rather, if so it must be, to die therein, than to perish gradually and ingloriously. When they had taken this resolution, they came out of their trenches, but could no way sustain the fight, being too much disabled, both in mind and body, and having not room to exert themselves, and thought it an advantage to be killed, and a misery to survive; so at the first onset there fell about seven thousand of them, after which stroke they let all the courage they had put on before fall, and stood amazed at <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s warlike spirit under his own calamities; so for the future they yielded, and made him ruler of their nation; whereupon he was greatly elevated at so seasonable a success, and returned home, taking great authority upon him, on account of so bold and glorious an expedition as he had made. </p>                        </div>

So he took his kindness in good part, and bid him besides do what he had already done, that is, go on in serving him, by rolling up the letter and sealing it again, and delivering it to <a href=/people/2241 target=_blank>Malchus</a>, and then to bring back his letter in answer to it; for it would be much better if he could know <a href=/people/2241 target=_blank>Malchus</a>'s intentions also.

And when, upon his meeting him, he desired that he would let him speak to him, he therein exhibited a much more noble specimen of a great soul; for he did not betake himself to supplications, as men usually do upon such occasions, nor offered him any petition, as if he were an offender; but, after an undaunted manner, gave an account of what he had done; for he spake thus to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: That he had the greatest friendship for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and did every thing he could that he might attain the government; that he was not indeed in the army with him, because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> had diverted him; but that he had sent him both money and corn, which was but too little in comparison of what he ought to have done for him; for if a man owns himself to be another's friend, and knows him to be a benefactor, he is obliged to hazard every thing, to use every faculty of his soul, every member of his body, and all the wealth he hath, for him, in which I confess I have been too deficient. However, I am conscious to myself, that so far I have done right, that I have not deserted him upon his defeat at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389207LAkt class=place long=20.68 lat=38.942>Actium</a>; nor upon the evident change of his fortune have I transferred my hopes from him to another, but have preserved myself, though not as a valuable fellow soldier, yet certainly as a faithful counselor, to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, when I demonstrated to him that the only way that he had to save himself, and not to lose all his authority, was to slay <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>; for when she was once dead, there would be room for him to retain his authority, and rather to bring thee to make a composition with him, than to continue at enmity any longer. None of which advises would he attend to, but preferred his own rash resolution before them, which have happened unprofitably for him, but profitably for thee. Now, therefore, in case thou determinest about me, and my alacrity in serving <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, according to thy anger at him, I own there is no room for me to deny what I have done, nor will I be ashamed to own, and that publicly too, that I had a great kindness for him. But if thou wilt put him out of the case, and only examine how I behave myself to my benefactors in general, and what sort of friend I am, thou wilt find by experience that we shall do and be the same to thyself, for it is but changing the names, and the firmness of friendship that we shall bear to thee will not be disapproved by thee. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he restored him his diadem again; and encouraged him to exhibit himself as great a friend to himself as he had been to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and then had him in great esteem. Moreover, he added this, that Quintus <a href=/people/3581 target=_blank>Didius</a> had written to him that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had very readily assisted him in the affair of the gladiators. So when he had obtained such a kind reception, and had, beyond all his hopes, procured his crown to be more entirely and firmly settled upon him than ever by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s donation, as well as by that decree of the Romans, which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> took care to procure for his greater security, he conducted <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on his way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and made presents, even beyond his ability, to both him and his friends, and in general behaved himself with great magnanimity.

She also was grieved that he would not allow her any hopes of surviving him, if he should come to any harm himself.

He had a further ground of hope also, that though <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> should have all the success he could wish for, and should return again, he could not contradict his wife in what she desired, for he knew that the king's fondness for his wife was inexpressible.

This much troubled him, to see that this surprising hatred of his wife to him was not concealed, but open; and he took this so ill, and yet was so unable to bear it, on account of the fondness he had for her, that he could not continue long in any one mind, but sometimes was angry at her, and sometimes reconciled himself to her; but by always changing one passion for another, he was still in great uncertainty, and thus was he entangled between hatred and love, and was frequently disposed to inflict punishment on her for her insolence towards him; but being deeply in love with her in his soul, he was not able to get quit of this woman. In short, as he would gladly have her punished, so was he afraid lest, ere he were aware, he should, by putting her to death, bring a heavier punishment upon himself at the same time. </p>                        </div>

Now, though he willingly enough heard their words, yet had not he courage enough to do any thing to her as if he believed them; but still he became worse and worse disposed to her, and these ill passions were more and more inflamed on both sides, while she did not hide her disposition towards him, and he turned his love to her into wrath against her. But when he was just going to put this matter past all remedy, he heard the news that <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was the victor in the war, and that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> were both dead, and that he had conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; whereupon he made haste to go to meet <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and left the affairs of his family in their present state.

As for her, she was in other respects a chaste woman, and faithful to him; yet had she somewhat of a woman rough by nature, and treated her husband imperiously enough, because she saw he was so fond of her as to be enslaved to her. She did not also consider seasonably with herself that she lived under a monarchy, and that she was at another's disposal, and accordingly would behave herself after a saucy manner to him, which yet he usually put off in a jesting way, and bore with moderation and good temper. She would also expose his mother and his sister openly, on account of the meanness of their birth, and would speak unkindly of them, insomuch that there was before this a disagreement and unpardonable hatred among the women, and it was now come to greater reproaches of one another than formerly, which suspicions increased, and lasted a whole year after <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> returned from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. However, these misfortunes, which had been kept under some decency for a great while, burst out all at once upon such an occasion as was now offered; for as the king was one day about noon lain down on his bed to rest him, he called for <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>, out of the great affection he had always for her. She came in accordingly, but would not lie down by him; and when he was very desirous of her company, she showed her contempt of him; and added, by way of reproach, that he had caused her father and her brother to be slain. And when he took this injury very unkindly, and was ready to use violence to her, in a precipitate manner, the king's sister <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, observing that he was more than ordinarily disturbed, sent in to the king his cup-bearer, who had been prepared long beforehand for such a design, and bid him tell the king how <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> had persuaded him to give his assistance in preparing a love potion for him; and if he appeared to be greatly concerned, and to ask what that love potion was, to tell him that she had the potion, and that he was desired only to give it him; but that in case he did not appear to be much concerned at this potion, to let the thing drop; and that if he did so, no harm should thereby come to him. When she had given him these instructions, she sent him in at this time to make such a speech. So he went in, after a composed manner, to gain credit to what he should say, and yet somewhat hastily, and said that <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> had given him presents, and persuaded him to give him a love potion. And when this moved the king, he said that this love potion was a composition that she had given him, whose effects he did not know, which was the reason of his resolving to give him this information, as the safest course he could take, both for himself and for the king. When <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> heard what he said, and was in an ill disposition before, his indignation grew more violent; and he ordered that eunuch of <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>, who was most faithful to her, to be brought to torture about this potion, as well knowing it was not possible that any thing small or great could be done without him. And when the man was under the utmost agonies, he could say nothing concerning the thing he was tortured about, but so far he knew, that <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>'s hatred against him was occasioned by somewhat that <a href=/people/3695 target=_blank>Sohemus</a> had said to her. Now as he was saying this, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> cried out aloud, and said that <a href=/people/3695 target=_blank>Sohemus</a>, who had been at all other times most faithful to him, and to his government, would not have betrayed what injunctions he had given him, unless he had had a nearer conversation than ordinary with <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>. So he gave order that <a href=/people/3695 target=_blank>Sohemus</a> should be seized on and slain immediately; but he allowed his wife to take her trial; and got together those that were most faithful to him, and laid an elaborate accusation against her for this love potion and composition, which had been charged upon her by way of calumny only. However, he kept no temper in what he said, and was in too great a passion for judging well about this matter. Accordingly, when the court was at length satisfied that he was so resolved, they passed the sentence of death upon her; but when the sentence was passed upon her, this temper was suggested by himself, and by some others of the court, that she should not be thus hastily put to death, but be laid in prison in one of the fortresses belonging to the kingdom: but <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> and her party labored hard to have the woman put to death; and they prevailed with the king to do so, and advised this out of caution, lest the multitude should be tumultuous if she were suffered to live; and thus was <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> led to execution. </p>                        </div>

And when she had for some time acted after this hypocritical manner, and been so outrageous as to tear her hair, this indecent and dissembling behavior, as was to be expected, was greatly condemned by the rest of the spectators, as it was principally by the poor woman who was to suffer; for at the first she gave her not a word, nor was discomposed at her peevishness, and only looked at her, yet did she out of a greatness of soul discover her concern for her mother's offense, and especially for her exposing herself in a manner so unbecoming her; but as for herself, she went to her death with an unshaken firmness of mind, and without changing the color of her face, and thereby evidently discovered the nobility of her descent to the spectators, even in the last moments of her life. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, that which most afflicted her was, what he had done to her relations, and she ventured to speak of all they had suffered by him, and at last greatly provoked both the king's mother and sister, till they became enemies to her; and even he himself also did the same, on whom alone she depended for her expectations of escaping the last of punishments. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, he bethought him of every thing he could make use of to divert his mind from thinking of her, and contrived feasts and assemblies for that purpose, but nothing would suffice; he therefore laid aside the administration of public affairs, and was so far conquered by his passion, that he would order his servants to call for <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>, as if she were still alive, and could still hear them. And when he was in this way, there arose a pestilential disease, and carried off the greatest part of the multitude, and of his best and most esteemed friends, and made all men suspect that this was brought upon them by the anger of God, for the injustice that had been done to <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>. This circumstance affected the king still more, till at length he forced himself to go into desert places, and there, under pretense of going a hunting, bitterly afflicted himself; yet had he not borne his grief there many days before he fell into a most dangerous distemper himself: he had an inflammation upon him, and a pain in the hinder part of his head, joined with madness; and for the remedies that were used, they did him no good at all, but proved contrary to his case, and so at length brought him to despair. All the physicians also that were about him, partly because the medicines they brought for his recovery could not at all conquer the disease, and partly because his diet could be no other than what his disease inclined him to, desired him to eat whatever he had a mind to, and so left the small hopes they had of his recovery in the power of that diet, and committed him to fortune.

He therefore sent to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, and informed her that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=ethnic long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumeans</a> had been always under his progenitors, and that for the same reason it was but just that she should desire that country for him of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, for that he was ready to transfer his friendship to her; and this he did, not because he was better pleased to be under <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s government, but because he thought that, upon the diminution of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s power, it would not be difficult for him to obtain himself the entire government over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=ethnic long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumeans</a>, and somewhat more also; for he raised his hopes still higher, as having no small pretenses, both by his birth and by these riches which he had gotten by his constant attention to filthy lucre; and accordingly it was not a small matter that he aimed at. So <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> desired this country of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, but failed of her purpose. An account of this was brought to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who was thereupon ready to kill <a href=/people/3372 target=_blank>Costobarus</a>; yet, upon the entreaties of his sister and mother, he forgave him, and vouchsafed to pardon him entirely; though he still had a suspicion of him afterward for this his attempt. </p>                        </div>

However, <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> chose to follow not the law of her country, but the law of her authority, and so renounced her wedlock; and told her brother <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, that she left her husband out of her good-will to him, because she perceived that he, with <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, and <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, and <a href=/people/2306 target=_blank>Dositheus</a>, were raising a sedition against him; as an evidence whereof, she alleged the case of the sons of Babas, that they had been by him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years; which proved to be true. But when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> thus unexpectedly heard of it, he was greatly surprised at it, and was the more surprised, because the relation appeared incredible to him. As for the fact relating to these sons of Babas, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had formerly taken great pains to bring them to punishment, as being enemies to his government; but they were now forgotten by him, on account of the length of time [since he had ordered them to be slain]. Now the cause of his ill-will and hatred to them arose hence, that while <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> was king, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, with his army, besieged the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, where the distress and miseries which the besieged endured were so pressing, that the greater number of them invited <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> into the city, and already placed their hopes on him. Now the sons of Babas were of great dignity, and had power among the multitude, and were faithful to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, and were always raising calumnies against <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and encouraged the people to preserve the government to that royal family which held it by inheritance. So these men acted thus politically, and, as they thought, for their own advantage; but when the city was taken, and <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had gotten the government into his hands, and <a href=/people/3372 target=_blank>Costobarus</a> was appointed to hinder men from passing out at the gates, and to guard the city, that those citizens that were guilty, and of the party opposite to the king, might not get out of it, <a href=/people/3372 target=_blank>Costobarus</a>, being sensible that the sons of Babas were had in respect and honor by the whole multitude, and supposing that their preservation might be of great advantage to him in the changes of government afterward, he set them by themselves, and concealed them in his own farms; and when the thing was suspected, he assured <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> upon oath that he really knew nothing of that matter, and so overcame the suspicions that lay upon him; nay, after that, when the king had publicly proposed a reward for the discovery, and had put in practice all sorts of methods for searching out this matter, he would not confess it; but being persuaded that when he had at first denied it, if the men were found, he should not escape unpunished, he was forced to keep them secret, not only out of his good-will to them, but out of a necessary regard to his own preservation also. But when the king knew the thing, by his sister's information, he sent men to the places where he had the intimation they were concealed, and ordered both them, and those that were accused as guilty with them, to be slain, insomuch that there were now none at all left of the kindred of <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, and the kingdom was entirely in <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s own power, and there was nobody remaining of such dignity as could put a stop to what he did against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> laws. </p>                        </div>

Both of them were indeed costly works, but opposite to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> customs; for we have had no such shows delivered down to us as fit to be used or exhibited by us; yet did he celebrate these games every five years, in the most solemn and splendid manner. He also made proclamation to the neighboring countries, and called men together out of every nation. The wrestlers also, and the rest of those that strove for the prizes in such games, were invited out of every land, both by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed, and by the glory of victory to be there gained. So the principal persons that were the most eminent in these sorts of exercises were gotten together, for there were very great rewards for victory proposed, not only to those that performed their exercises naked, but to those that played the musicians also, and were called Thymelici; and he spared no pains to induce all persons, the most famous for such exercises, to come to this contest for victory. He also proposed no small rewards to those who ran for the prizes in chariot races, when they were drawn by two, or three, or four pair of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>. He also imitated every thing, though never so costly or magnificent, in other nations, out of an ambition that he might give most public demonstration of his grandeur. Inscriptions also of the great actions of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and trophies of those nations which he had conquered in his wars, and all made of the purest gold and silver, encompassed the theater itself; nor was there any thing that could be subservient to his design, whether it were precious garments, or precious stones set in order, which was not also exposed to sight in these games. He had also made a great preparation of wild beasts, and of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a> themselves in great abundance, and of such other beasts as were either of uncommon strength, or of such a sort as were rarely seen. These were prepared either to fight with one another, or that men who were condemned to death were to fight with them. And truly foreigners were greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses here exhibited, and at the great dangers that were here seen; but to natural <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for which they had so great a veneration. It appeared also no better than an instance of barefaced impiety, to throw men to wild beasts, for the affording delight to the spectators; and it appeared an instance of no less impiety, to change their own laws for such foreign exercises: but, above all the rest, the trophies gave most distaste to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>; for as they imagined them to be images, included within the armor that hung round about them, they were sorely displeased at them, because it was not the custom of their country to pay honors to such images. </p>                        </div>

Now when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> saw them in such a disorder, and that they would not easily change their resolution unless they received satisfaction in this point, he called to him the most eminent men among them, and brought them upon the theater, and showed them the trophies, and asked them what sort of things they took these trophies to be; and when they cried out that they were the images of men, he gave order that they should be stripped of these outward ornaments which were about them, and showed them the naked pieces of wood; which pieces of wood, now without any ornament, became matter of great sport and laughter to them, because they had before always had the ornaments of images themselves in derision. </p>                        </div>

These conspirators, therefore, standing thus prepared beforehand, went about their design with great alacrity; but there was one of those spies of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, that were appointed for such purposes, to fish out and inform him of any conspiracies that should be made against him, who found out the whole affair, and told the king of it, as he was about to go into the theater. So when he reflected on the hatred which he knew the greatest part of the people bore him, and on the disturbances that arose upon every occasion, he thought this plot against him not to be improbable. Accordingly, he retired into his palace, and called those that were accused of this conspiracy before him by their several names; and as, upon the guards falling upon them, they were caught in the very fact, and knew they could not escape, they prepared themselves for their ends with all the decency they could, and so as not at all to recede from their resolute behavior, for they showed no shame for what they were about, nor denied it; but when they were seized, they showed their daggers, and professed that the conspiracy they had sworn to was a holy and pious action; that what they intended to do was not for gain, or out of any indulgence to their passions, but principally for those common customs of their country, which all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were obliged to observe, or to die for them. This was what these men said, out of their undaunted courage in this conspiracy. So they were led away to execution by the king's guards that stood about them, and patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they died.

Moreover, he chose out some select horsemen, and placed them ill the great plain; and built [for them] a place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, called Gaba with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318358UEsb class=place long=35.809 lat=31.8006>Hesebonitis</a>, in Peraea. And these were the places which he particularly built, while he always was inventing somewhat further for his own security, and encompassing the whole nation with guards, that they might by no means get from under his power, nor fall into tumults, which they did continually upon any small commotion; and that if they did make any commotions, he might know of it, while some of his spies might be upon them from the neighborhood, and might both be able to know what they were attempting, and to prevent it. And when he went about building the wall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a>, he contrived to bring thither many of those that had been assisting to him in his wars, and many of the people in that neighborhood also, whom he made fellow citizens with the rest. This he did out of an ambitious desire of building a temple, and out of a desire to make the city more eminent than it had been before; but principally because he contrived that it might at once be for his own security, and a monument of his magnificence. He also changed its name, and called it <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Sebaste</a>.

Besides all which, he encompassed the city with a wall of great strength, and made use of the acclivity of the place for making its fortifications stronger; nor was the compass of the place made now so small as it had been before, but was such as rendered it not inferior to the most famous cities; for it was twenty furlongs in circumference. Now within, and about the middle of it, he built a sacred place, of a furlong and a half [in circuit], and adorned it with all sorts of decorations, and therein erected a temple, which was illustrious on account of both its largeness and beauty. And as to the several parts of the city, he adorned them with decorations of all sorts also; and as to what was necessary to provide for his own security, he made the walls very strong for that purpose, and made it for the greatest part a citadel; and as to the elegance of the building, it was taken care of also, that he might leave monuments of the fineness of his taste, and of his beneficence, to future ages. </p>                        </div>

The destruction of men also after such a manner deprived those that survived of all their courage, because they had no way to provide remedies sufficient for the distresses they were in. When therefore the fruits of that year were spoiled, and whatsoever they had laid up beforehand was spent, there was no foundation of hope for relief remaining, but the misery, contrary to what they expected still increased upon them; and this not only on that year, while they had nothing for themselves left [at the end of it], but what seed they had sown perished also, by reason of the ground not yielding its fruits on the second year. This distress they were in made them also, out of necessity, to eat many things that did not use to be eaten; nor was the king himself free from this distress any more than other men, as being deprived of that tribute he used to have from the fruits of the ground, and having already expended what money he had, in his liberality to those whose cities he had built; nor had he any people that were worthy of his assistance, since this miserable state of things had procured him the hatred of his subjects: for it is a constant rule, that misfortunes are still laid to the account of those that govern. </p>                        </div>

However, he thought it his best way, by all means, not to leave off his endeavors to assist his people; so he cut off the rich furniture that was in his palace, both of silver and gold, insomuch that he did not spare the finest vessels he had, or those that were made with the most elaborate skill of the artificers, but sent the money to <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, who had been made prefect of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; and as not a few had already fled to him under their necessities, and as he was particularly a friend to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and desirous to have his subjects preserved, he gave leave to them in the first place to export corn, and assisted them every way, both in purchasing and exporting the same; so that he was the principal, if not the only person, who afforded them what help they had. And <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> taking care the people should understand that this help came from himself, did thereby not only remove the ill opinion of those that formerly hated him, but gave them the greatest demonstration possible of his good-will to them, and care of them; for, in the first place, as for those who were able to provide their own food, he distributed to them their proportion of corn in the exactest manner; but for those many that were not able, either by reason of their old age, or any other infirmity, to provide food for themselves, he made this provision for them, the bakers should make their bread ready for them. He also took care that they might not be hurt by the dangers of winter, since they were in great want of clothing also, by reason of the utter destruction and consumption of their <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, till they had no wool to make use of, nor any thing else to cover themselves withal. And when he had procured these things for his own subjects, he went further, in order to provide necessaries for their neighbors, and gave seed to the Syrians, which thing turned greatly to his own advantage also, this charitable assistance being afforded most seasonably to their fruitful soil, so that every one had now a plentiful provision of food. Upon the whole, when the harvest of the land was approaching, he sent no fewer than fifty thousand men, whom he had sustained, into the country; by which means he both repaired the afflicted condition of his own kingdom with great generosity and diligence, and lightened the afflictions of his neighbors, who were under the same calamities; for there was nobody who had been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by him; nay, further, there were neither any people, nor any cities, nor any private men, who were to make provision for the multitudes, and on that account were in want of support, and had recourse to him, but received what they stood in need of, insomuch that it appeared, upon a computation, that the number of cori of wheat, of ten attic medimni apiece, that were given to foreigners, amounted to ten thousand, and the number that was given in his own kingdom was about fourscore thousand. Now it happened that this care of his, and this seasonable benefaction, had such influence on the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and was so cried up among other nations, as to wipe off that old hatred which his violation of some of their customs, during his reign, had procured him among all the nation, and that this liberality of his assistance in this their greatest necessity was full satisfaction for all that he had done of that nature, as it also procured him great fame among foreigners; and it looked as if these calamities that afflicted his land, to a degree plainly incredible, came in order to raise his glory, and to be to his great advantage; for the greatness of his liberality in these distresses, which he now demonstrated beyond all expectation, did so change the disposition of the multitude towards him, that they were ready to suppose he had been from the beginning not such a one as they had found him to be by experience, but such a one as the care he had taken of them in supplying their necessities proved him now to be. </p>                        </div>

When therefore his affairs were thus improved, and were again in a flourishing condition, he built himself a palace in the upper city, raising the rooms to a very great height, and adorning them with the most costly furniture of gold, and marble scats, and beds; and these were so large that they could contain very many companies of men. These apartments were also of distinct magnitudes, and had particular names given them; for one apartment was called <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s, another <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s. He also fell in love again, and married another wife, not suffering his reason to hinder him from living as he pleased. The occasion of this his marriage was as follows: There was one <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, the son of one <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a>, a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and a priest of great note there; this man had a daughter, who was esteemed the most beautiful woman of that time; and when the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> began to speak much in her commendation, it happened that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was much affected with what was said of her; and when he saw the damsel, he was smitten with her beauty, yet did he entirely reject the thoughts of using his authority to abuse her, as believing, what was the truth, that by so doing he should be stigmatized for violence and tyranny; so he thought it best to take the damsel to wife. And while <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> was of a dignity too inferior to be allied to him, but still too considerable to be despised, he governed his inclinations after the most prudent manner, by augmenting the dignity of the family, and making them more honorable; so he immediately deprived Jesus, the son of Phabet, of the high priesthood, and conferred that dignity on <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, and so joined in affinity with him [by marrying his daughter]. </p>                        </div>

But still he took care to have external security for his government as a fortress against his subjects; for the orations he made to the cities were very fine, and full of kindness; and he cultivated a seasonable good understanding with their governors, and bestowed presents on every one of them, inducing them thereby to be more friendly to him, and using his magnificent disposition so as his kingdom might be the better secured to him, and this till all his affairs were every way more and more augmented.

He also adorned it with most sumptuous palaces and large edifices for containing the people; and what was the greatest and most laborious work of all, he adorned it with a closed harbor. Its largeness was not less than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, and had towards the city a double station for the ships. It was of excellent workmanship; and this was the more remarkable for its being built in a place that of itself was not suitable to such noble structures, but was to be brought to perfection by materials from other places, and at very great expenses. This city is situate in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, in the passage by sea to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/320348UJop class=place long=34.752 lat=32.054>Joppa</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326349UDor class=place long=34.9169 lat=32.6175>Dora</a> which are lesser maritime cities, and not fit for havens, on account of the impetuous south winds that beat upon them, which rolling the sands that come from the sea against the shores, do not admit of ships lying in their station; but the merchants are generally there forced to ride at their anchors in the sea itself. So <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> endeavored to rectify this inconvenience, and laid out such a compass towards the land as might be sufficient for a haven, wherein the great ships might lie in safety; and this he effected by letting down vast stones of above fifty feet in length, not less than eighteen in breadth, and nine in depth, into twenty fathom deep; and as some were lesser, so were others bigger than those dimensions. This mole which he built by the sea-side was two hundred feet wide, the half of which was opposed to the current of the waves, so as to keep off those waves which were to break upon them, and so was called Procymatia, or the first breaker of the waves; but the other half had upon it a wall, with several towers, the largest of which was named Drusion, and was a work of very great excellence, and had its name from <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, the son-in-law of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who died young. There were also a great number of arches where the mariners dwelt. There was also before them a quay, [or landing place,] which ran round the entire haven, and was a most agreeable walk to such as had a mind to that exercise; but the entrance or mouth of the port was made on the north quarter, on which side was the stillest of the winds of all in this place: and the basis of the whole circuit on the left hand, as you enter the port, supported a round turret, which was made very strong, in order to resist the greatest waves; while on the right hand, as you enter, stood two vast stones, and those each of them larger than the turret, which were over against them; these stood upright, and were joined together. Now there were edifices all along the circular haven, made of the politest stone, with a certain elevation, whereon was erected a temple of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that was seen a great way off by those that were sailing for that haven, and had in it two statues, the one of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, the other of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. The city itself was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>, which was also itself built of fine materials, and was of a fine structure; nay, the very subterranean vaults and cellars had no less of architecture bestowed on them than had the buildings above ground. Some of these vaults carried things at even distances to the haven and to the sea; but one of them ran obliquely, and bound all the rest together, that both the rain and the filth of the citizens were together carried off with ease, and the sea itself, upon the flux of the tide from without, came into the city, and washed it all clean. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> also built therein a theater of stone; and on the south quarter, behind the port, an amphitheater also, capable of holding a vast number of men, and conveniently situated for a prospect to the sea. So this city was thus finished in twelve years; during which time the king did not fail to go on both with the work, and to pay the charges that were necessary. </p>                        </div>

Sometimes they did this by making incursions upon him, and sometimes by attempting force against him, and sometimes by going to law with him. Moreover, they persuaded the poorer soldiers to help them, and were troublesome to him, out of a constant hope that they should reduce the people to raise a sedition; in which designs those that are in the most miserable circumstances of life are still the most earnest; and although <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had been a great while apprized of these attempts, yet did not he indulge any severity to them, but by rational methods aimed to mitigate things, as not willing to give any handle for tumults. </p>                        </div>

These reproaches they mainly ventured upon by the encouragement of <a href=/people/2800 target=_blank>Zenodorus</a>, who took his oath that he would never leave <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> till he had procured that they should be severed from <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s kingdom, and joined to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s province. The <a href=/people/7697 target=_blank>Gadarenes</a> were induced hereby, and made no small cry against him, and that the more boldly, because those that had been delivered up by <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> were not punished by <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who let them go, and did them no harm; for indeed he was the principal man in the world who appeared almost inexorable in punishing crimes in his own family, but very generous in remitting the offenses that were committed elsewhere. And while they accused <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> of injuries, and plunderings, and subversions of temples, he stood unconcerned, and was ready to make his defense. However, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> gave him his right hand, and remitted nothing of his kindness to him, upon this disturbance by the multitude; and indeed these things were alleged the first day, but the hearing proceeded no further; for as the <a href=/people/7697 target=_blank>Gadarenes</a> saw the inclination of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and of his assessors, and expected, as they had reason to do, that they should be delivered up to the king, some of them, out of a dread of the torments they might undergo, cut their own throats in the night time, and some of them threw themselves down precipices, and others of them cast themselves into the river, and destroyed themselves of their own accord; which accidents seemed a sufficient condemnation of the rashness and crimes they had been guilty of; whereupon <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> made no longer delay, but cleared <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> from the crimes he was accused of. Another happy accident there was, which was a further great advantage to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> at this time; for <a href=/people/2800 target=_blank>Zenodorus</a>'s belly burst, and a great quantity of blood issued from him in his sickness, and he thereby departed this life at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>; so <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> bestowed his country, which was no small one, upon <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>; it lay between <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329364RTra class=place long=36.4 lat=32.9>Trachon</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, and contained Ulatha, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/332356UPan class=place long=35.6931 lat=33.2479>Paneas</a>, and the country round about. He also made him one of the procurators of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and commanded that they should do every thing with his approbation; and, in short, he arrived at that pitch of felicity, that whereas there were but two men that governed the vast Roman empire, first <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and then <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who was his principal favorite, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> preferred no one to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> besides <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, and <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> made no one his greater friend than <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> besides <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. And when he had acquired such freedom, he begged of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> a tetrarchy for his brother <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, while he did himself bestow upon him a revenue of a hundred talents out of his own kingdom, that in case he came to any harm himself, his brother might be in safety, and that his sons might not have dominion over him. So when he had conducted <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to the sea, and was returned home, he built him a most beautiful temple, of the whitest stone, in <a href=/people/2800 target=_blank>Zenodorus</a>'s country, near the place called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/332356UPan class=place long=35.6931 lat=33.2479>Panium</a>. This is a very fine cave in a mountain, under which there is a great cavity in the earth, and the cavern is abrupt, and prodigiously deep, and frill of a still water; over it hangs a vast mountain; and under the caverns arise the springs of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a>. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> adorned this place, which was already a very remarkable one, still further by the erection of this temple, which he dedicated to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. </p>                        </div>

He endeavored also to persuade <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a> the Pharisee, and Satneas, and the greatest part of their scholars, to take the oath; but these would neither submit so to do, nor were they punished together with the rest, out of the reverence he bore to <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>.

This man once saw <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> when he was a child, and going to school, and saluted him as king of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>; but he, thinking that either he did not know him, or that he was in jest, put him in mind that he was but a private man; but <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a> smiled to himself, and clapped him on his backside with his hand, and said, However that be, thou wilt be king, and wilt begin thy reign happily, for God finds thee worthy of it. And do thou remember the blows that <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a> hath given thee, as being a signal of the change of thy fortune. And truly this will be the best reasoning for thee, that thou love justice [towards men], and piety towards God, and clemency towards thy citizens; yet do I know how thy whole conduct will be, that thou wilt not be such a one, for thou wilt excel all men in happiness, and obtain an everlasting reputation, but wilt forget piety and righteousness; and these crimes will not be concealed from God, at the conclusion of thy life, when thou wilt find that he will be mindful of them, and punish time for them. Now at that time <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> did not at all attend to what <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a> said, as having no hopes of such advancement; but a little afterward, when he was so fortunate as to be advanced to the dignity of king, and was in the height of his dominion, he sent for <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a>, and asked him how long he should reign. <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a> did not tell him the full length of his reign; wherefore, upon that silence of his, he asked him further, whether he should reign ten years or not? He replied, Yes, twenty, nay, thirty years; but did not assign the just determinate limit of his reign. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was satisfied with these replies, and gave <a href=/people/3878 target=_blank>Manahem</a> his hand, and dismissed him; and from that time he continued to honor all the <a href=/people/3171 target=_blank>Essens</a>.

They were adorned with embroidered veils, with their flowers of purple, and pillars interwoven; and over these, but under the crown-work, was spread out a golden vine, with its branches hanging down from a great height, the largeness and fine workmanship of which was a surprising sight to the spectators, to see what vast materials there were, and with what great skill the workmanship was done. He also encompassed the entire <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> with very large cloisters, contriving them to be in a due proportion thereto; and he laid out larger sums of money upon them than had been done before him, till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> as he had done. There was a large wall to both the cloisters, which wall was itself the most prodigious work that was ever heard of by man. The hill was a rocky ascent, that declined by degrees towards the east parts of the city, till it came to an elevated level. This hill it was which <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, who was the first of our kings, by Divine revelation, encompassed with a wall; it was of excellent workmanship upwards, and round the top of it. He also built a wall below, beginning at the bottom, which was encompassed by a deep valley; and at the south side he laid rocks together, and bound them one to another with lead, and included some of the inner parts, till it proceeded to a great height, and till both the largeness of the square edifice and its altitude were immense, and till the vastness of the stones in the front were plainly visible on the outside, yet so that the inward parts were fastened together with iron, and preserved the joints immovable for all future times. When this work [for the foundation] was done in this manner, and joined together as part of the hill itself to the very top of it, he wrought it all into one outward surface, and filled up the hollow places which were about the wall, and made it a level on the external upper surface, and a smooth level also. This hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs, [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong: but within this wall, and on the very top of all, there ran another wall of stone also, having, on the east quarter, a double cloister, of the same length with the wall; in the midst of which was the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> itself. This cloister looked to the gates of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>; and it had been adorned by many kings in former times; and round about the entire <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> were fixed the spoils taken from barbarous nations; all these had been dedicated to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> by <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, with the addition of those he had taken from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>. </p>                        </div>

However, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> sent ambassadors to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Caesar, to intercede with him for them; upon whose coming, king <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, junior, being then at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, asked for and obtained the power over them from the emperor, who gave command to <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, who was then commander in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, to give it them accordingly.

This cloister had pillars that stood in four rows one over against the other all along, for the fourth row was interwoven into the wall, which [also was built of stone]; and the thickness of each pillar was such, that three men might, with their arms extended, fathom it round, and join their hands again, while its length was twenty-seven feet, with a double spiral at its basis; and the number of all the pillars [in that court] was a hundred and sixty-two. Their chapiters were made with sculptures after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> order, and caused an amazement [to the spectators], by reason of the grandeur of the whole. These four rows of pillars included three intervals for walking in the middle of this cloister; two of which walks were made parallel to each other, and were contrived after the same manner; the breadth of each of them was thirty feet, the length was a furlong, and the height fifty feet; but the breadth of the middle part of the cloister was one and a half of the other, and the height was double, for it was much higher than those on each side; but the roofs were adorned with deep sculptures in wood, representing many sorts of figures. The middle was much higher than the rest, and the wall of the front was adorned with beams, resting upon pillars, that were interwoven into it, and that front was all of polished stone, insomuch that its fineness, to such as had not seen it, was incredible, and to such as had seen it, was greatly amazing. Thus was the first enclosure. In the midst of which, and not far from it, was the second, to be gone up to by a few steps: this was encompassed by a stone wall for a partition, with an inscription, which forbade any foreigner to go in under pain of death. Now this inner enclosure had on its southern and northern quarters three gates [equally] distant one from another; but on the east quarter, towards the sun-rising, there was one large gate, through which such as were pure came in, together with their wives; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> further inward in that gate was not allowed to the women; but still more inward was there a third [court of the] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, whereinto it was not lawful for any but the priests alone to enter. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> itself was within this; and before that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was the altar, upon which we offer our sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God. Into none of these three did king <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> enter, for he was forbidden, because he was not a priest. However, he took care of the cloisters and the outer enclosures, and these he built in eight years. </p>                        </div>

He also took so much pleasure there, that he abode many days with them, and would willingly have staid longer, but that the season of the year made him make haste away; for as winter was coming on, he thought it not safe to go to sea later, and yet he was of necessity to return again to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>. </p>                        </div>

So when he had sailed by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> and by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, he touched at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>, as thinking he should have overtaken <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> there; but he was taken short here by a north wind, which hindered his ship from going to the shore; so he continued many days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chius</a>, and there he kindly treated a great many that came to him, and obliged them by giving them royal gifts. And when he saw that the portico of the city was fallen down, which as it was overthrown in the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> war, and was very large and fine building, so was it not so easy to rebuild that as it was the rest, yet did he furnish a sum not only large enough for that purpose, but what was more than sufficient to finish the building; and ordered them not to overlook that portico, but to rebuild it quickly, that so the city might recover its proper ornaments. And when the high winds were laid, he sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mytilene</a>, and thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>; and when he heard that <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was sailed beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412291IKya class=place long=29.11517 lat=41.234>Cyanean</a> rocks, he made all the haste possible to overtake him, and came up with him about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420351PSin class=place long=35.143 lat=42.025>Sinope</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>. He was seen sailing by the ship-men most unexpectedly, but appeared to their great joy; and many friendly salutations there were between them, insomuch that <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> thought he had received the greatest marks of the king's kindness and humanity towards him possible, since the king had come so long a voyage, and at a very proper season, for his assistance, and had left the government of his own dominions, and thought it more worth his while to come to him. Accordingly, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was all in all to <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, in the management of the war, and a great assistant in civil affairs, and in giving him counsel as to particular matters. He was also a pleasant companion for him when he relaxed himself, and a joint partaker with him in all things; in troubles because of his kindness, and in prosperity because of the respect <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had for him. Now as soon as those affairs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> were finished, for whose sake <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was sent thither, they did not think fit to return by sea, but passed through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap class=place long=30 lat=41>Paphlagonia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>; they then traveled thence over great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, and then they sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>. And indeed the king bestowed a great many benefits on every city that he came to, according as they stood in need of them; for as for those that wanted either money or kind treatment, he was not wanting to them; but he supplied the former himself out of his own expenses: he also became an intercessor with <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> for all such as sought after his favor, and he brought things so about, that the petitioners failed in none of their suits to him, <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> being himself of a good disposition, and of great generosity, and ready to grant all such requests as might be advantageous to the petitioners, provided they were not to the detriment of others. The inclination of the king was of great weight also, and still excited <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who was himself ready to do good; for he made a reconciliation between the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, at whom he was angry, and paid what money the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chius</a> owed <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s procurators, and discharged them of their tributes; and helped all others, according as their several necessities required. </p>                        </div>

When this clamor was made, the king desired of <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> that he would hear their cause, and assigned <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a>, one of his friends, to plead for those their privileges. Accordingly, when <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had called the principal of the Romans, and such of the kings and rulers as were there, to be his assessors, <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> stood up, and pleaded for the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, as follows: </p>                        </div>

We have received these favors from you, who alone have power to grant them, but have them taken from us by such as are no greater than ourselves, and by such as we know are as much subjects as we are; and certainly, if we have been vouchsafed great favors, it is to our commendation who have obtained them, as having been found deserving of such great favors; and if those favors be but small ones, it would be barbarous for the donors not to confirm them to us. And for those that are the hinderance of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and use them reproachfully, it is evident that they affront both the receivers, while they will not allow those to be worthy men to whom their excellent rulers themselves have borne their testimony, and the donors, while they desire those favors already granted may be abrogated. Now if any one should ask these Gentiles themselves, which of the two things they would choose to part with, their lives, or the customs of their forefathers, their solemnities, their sacrifices, their festivals, which they celebrated in honor of those they suppose to be gods? I know very well that they would choose to suffer any thing whatsoever rather than a dissolution of any of the customs of their forefathers; for a great many of them have rather chosen to go to war on that account, as very solicitous not to transgress in those matters. And indeed we take an estimate of that happiness which all mankind do now enjoy by your means from this very thing, that we are allowed every one to worship as our own institutions require, and yet to live [in peace]; and although they would not be thus treated themselves, yet do they endeavor to compel others to comply with them, as if it were not as great an instance of impiety profanely to dissolve the religious solemnities of any others, as to be negligent in the observation of their own towards their gods. And let us now consider the one of these practices. Is there any people, or city, or community of men, to whom your government and the Roman power does not appear to be the greatest blessing'. Is there any one that can desire to make void the favors they have granted? No one is certainly so mad; for there are no men but such as have been partakers of their favors, both public and private; and indeed those that take away what you have granted, can have no assurance but every one of their own grants made them by you may be taken from them also; which grants of yours can yet never be sufficiently valued; for if they consider the old governments under kings, together with your present government, besides the great number of benefits which this government hath bestowed on them, in order to their happiness, this is instead of all the rest, that they appear to be no longer in a state of slavery, but of freedom. Now the privileges we desire, even when we are in the best circumstances, are not such as deserve to be envied, for we are indeed in a prosperous state by your means, but this is only in common with others; and it is no more than this which we desire, to preserve our religion without any prohibition; which as it appears not in itself a privilege to be envied us, so it is for the advantage of those that grant it to us; for if the Divinity delights in being honored, it must delight in those that permit them to be honored. And there are none of our customs which are inhuman, but all tending to piety, and devoted to the preservation of justice; nor do we conceal those injunctions of ours by which we govern our lives, they being memorials of piety, and of a friendly conversation among men. And the seventh day we set apart from labor; it is dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws, we thinking it proper to reflect on them, as well as on any [good] thing else, in order to our avoiding of sin. If any one therefore examine into our observances, he will find they are good in themselves, and that they are ancient also, though some think otherwise, insomuch that those who have received them cannot easily be brought to depart from them, out of that honor they pay to the length of time they have religiously enjoyed them and observed them. Now our adversaries take these our privileges away in the way of injustice; they violently seize upon that money of ours which is owed to God, and called sacred money, and this openly, after a sacrilegious manner; and they impose tributes upon us, and bring us before tribunals on holy days, and then require other like debts of us, not because the contracts require it, and for their own advantage, but because they would put an affront on our religion, of which they are conscious as well as we, and have indulged themselves in an unjust, and to them involuntary, hatred; for your government over all is one, tending to the establishing of benevolence, and abolishing of ill-will among such as are disposed to it. This is therefore what we implore from thee, most excellent <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, that we may not be ill-treated; that we may not be abused; that we may not be hindered from making use of our own customs, nor be despoiled of our goods, nor be forced by these men to do what we ourselves force nobody to do; for these privileges of ours are not only according to justice, but have formerly been granted us by you. And we are able to read to you many decrees of the senate, and the tables that contain them, which are still extant in the capitol, concerning these things, which it is evident were granted after you had experience of our fidelity towards you, which ought to be valued, though no such fidelity had been; for you have hitherto preserved what people were in possession of, not to us only, but almost to all men, and have added greater advantages than they could have hoped for, and thereby your government is become a great advantage to them. And if any one were able to enumerate the prosperity you have conferred on every nation, which they possess by your means, he could never put an end to his discourse; but that we may demonstrate that we are not unworthy of all those advantages we have obtained, it will be sufficient for us, to say nothing of other things, but to speak freely of this king who now governs us, and is now one of thy assessors; and indeed in what instance of good-will, as to your house, hath he been deficient? What mark of fidelity to it hath he omitted? What token of honor hath he not devised? What occasion for his assistance of you hath he not regarded at the very first? What hindereth; therefore, but that your kindnesses may be as numerous as his so great benefits to you have been? It may also perhaps be fit not here to pass over in silence the valor of his father <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, who, when <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> made an expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, assisted him with two thousand armed men, and proved inferior to none, neither in the battles on land, nor in the management of the navy; and what need I say any thing of how great weight those soldiers were at that juncture? or how many and how great presents they were vouchsafed by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? And truly I ought before now to have mentioned the letters which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wrote to the senate; and how <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> had honors, and the freedom of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, bestowed upon him; for these are demonstrations both that we have received these favors by our own deserts, and do on that account petition thee for thy confirmation of them, from whom we had reason to hope for them, though they had not been given us before, both out of regard to our king's disposition towards you, and your disposition towards him. And further, we have been informed by those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were there with what kindness thou camest into our country, and how thou offeredst the most perfect sacrifices to God, and honoredst him with remarkable vows, and how thou gavest the people a feast, and acceptedst of their own hospitable presents to thee. We ought to esteem all these kind entertainments made both by our nation and to our city, to a man who is the ruler and manager of so much of the public affairs, as indications of that friendship which thou hast returned to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation, and which hath been procured them by the family of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>. So we put thee in mind of these things in the presence of the king, now sitting by thee, and make our request for no more but this, that what you have given us yourselves you will not see taken away by others from us. </p>                        </div>

Their pretense was no more than this, that while the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> inhabited in their country, they were entirely unjust to them [in not joining in their worship] but they demonstrated their generosity in this, that though they worshipped according to their institutions, they did nothing that ought to grieve them. So when <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> perceived that they had been oppressed by violence, he made this answer: That, on account of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s good-will and friendship, he was ready to grant the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> whatsoever they should ask him, and that their requests seemed to him in themselves just; and that if they requested any thing further, he should not scruple to grant it them, provided they were no way to the detriment of the Roman government; but that while their request was no more than this, that what privileges they had already given them might not be abrogated, he confirmed this to them, that they might continue in the observation of their own customs, without any one offering them the least injury. And when he had said thus, he dissolved the assembly; upon which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> stood up and saluted him, and gave him thanks for the kind disposition he showed to them. <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> also took this in a very obliging manner, and saluted him again, and embraced him in his arms; after which he went away from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>; but the king determined to sail from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a> to his own country; and when he had taken his leave of <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, he pursued his voyage, and landed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a> in a few days' time, as having favorable winds; from whence he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and there gathered all the people together to an assembly, not a few being there out of the country also. So he came to them, and gave them a particular account of all his journey, and of the affairs of all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in Asia, how by his means they would live without injurious treatment for the time to come. He also told them of the entire good fortune he had met with and how he had administered the government, and had not neglected any thing which was for their advantage; and as he was very joyful, he now remitted to them the fourth part of their taxes for the last year.

Now as for this hatred, it was equal on both sides, but the manner of exerting that hatred was different; for as for the young men, they were rash, reproaching and affronting the others openly, and were inexperienced enough to think it the most generous to declare their minds in that undaunted manner; but the others did not take that method, but made use of calumnies after a subtle and a spiteful manner, still provoking the young men, and imagining that their boldness might in time turn to the offering violence to their father; for inasmuch as they were not ashamed of the pretended crimes of their mother, nor thought she suffered justly, these supposed that might at length exceed all bounds, and induce them to think they ought to be avenged on their father, though it were by despatching him with their own hands. At length it came to this, that the whole city was full of their discourses, and, as is usual in such contests, the unskilfulness of the young men was pitied; but the contrivance of <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> was too hard for them, and what imputations she laid upon them came to be believed, by means of their own conduct; for they who were so deeply affected with the death of their mother, that while they said both she and themselves were in a miserable case, they vehemently complained of her pitiable end, which indeed was truly such, and said that they were themselves in a pitiable case also, because they were forced to live with those that had been her murderers, and to be partakers with them. </p>                        </div>

He then called to mind his former calamity, and considered that the disorders in his family had hindered him from enjoying any comfort from those that were dearest to him or from his wife whom he loved so well; and suspecting that his future troubles would soon be heavier and greater than those that were past, he was in great confusion of mind; for <a href=/people/1595 target=_blank>Divine Providence</a> had in reality conferred upon him a great many outward advantages for his happiness, even beyond his hopes; but the troubles he had at home were such as he never expected to have met with, and rendered him unfortunate; nay, both sorts came upon him to such a degree as no one could imagine, and made it a doubtful question, whether, upon the comparison of both, he ought to have exchanged so great a success of outward good things for so great misfortunes at home, or whether he ought not to have chosen to avoid the calamities relating to his family, though he had, for a compensation, never been possessed of the admired grandeur of a kingdom. </p>                        </div>

So he introduced <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> as their antagonist, and imagined that he made a good provision for discouraging their pride, and that after this was done to the young men, there might be a proper season for expecting these to be of a better disposition; but the event proved otherwise than he intended, for the young men thought he did them a very great injury; and as <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was a shrewd man, when he had once obtained this degree of freedom, and began to expect greater things than he had before hoped for, he had but one single design in his head, and that was to distress his brethren, and not at all to yield to them the pre-eminence, but to keep close to his father, who was already alienated from them by the calumnies he had heard about them, and ready to be wrought upon in any way his zeal against them should advise him to pursue, that he might be continually more and more severe against them. Accordingly, all the reports that were spread abroad came from him, while he avoided himself the suspicion as if those discoveries proceeded from him; but he rather chose to make use of those persons for his assistants that were unsuspected, and such as might be believed to speak truth by reason of the good-will they bore to the king; and indeed there were already not a few who cultivated a friendship with <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, in hopes of gaining somewhat by him, and these were the men who most of all persuaded <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, because they appeared to speak thus out of their good-will to him: and with these joint accusations, which from various foundations supported one another's veracity, the young men themselves afforded further occasions to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> also; for they were observed to shed tears often, on account of the injury that was offered them, and had their mother in their mouths; and among their friends they ventured to reproach their father, as not acting justly by them; all which things were with an evil intention reserved in memory by <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> against a proper opportunity; and when they were told to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, with aggravations, increased the disorder so much, that it brought a great tumult into the family; for while the king was very angry at imputations that were laid upon the sons of <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>, and was desirous to humble them, he still increased the honor that he had bestowed on <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, and was at last so overcome by his persuasions, that he brought his mother to court also.

Now as to themselves, they knew in their own conscience they were innocent; but because they were accused by their father, they were sensible, as the truth was, that it was hard for them to make their apology, since though they were at liberty to speak their minds freely as the occasion required, and might with force and earnestness refute the accusation, yet was it not now decent so to do. There was therefore a difficulty how they should be able to speak; and tears, and at length a deep groan, followed, while they were afraid, that if they said nothing, they should seem to be in this difficulty from a consciousness of guilt, — nor had they any defense ready, by reason of their youth, and the disorder they were under; yet was not <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> unapprized, when he looked upon them in the confusion they were in, that their delay to make their defense did not arise from any consciousness of great enormities, but from their unskilfulness and modesty.

And if our open defense may be taken to be true, we shall be happy, both in pacifying thee, and in escaping the danger we are in; but if this calumny so prevails, it is more than enough for us that we have seen the sun this day; which why should we see, if this suspicion be fixed upon us? Now it is easy to say of young men, that they desire to reign; and to say further, that this evil proceeds from the case of our unhappy mother. This is abundantly sufficient to produce our present misfortune out of the former; but consider well, whether such an accusation does not suit all such young men, and may not be said of them all promiscuously; for nothing can hinder him that reigns, if he have children, and their mother be dead, but the father may have a suspicion upon all his sons, as intending some treachery to him; but a suspicion is not sufficient to prove such an impious practice. Now let any man say, whether we have actually and insolently attempted any such thing, whereby actions otherwise incredible use to be made credible? Can any body prove that poison hath been prepared? or prove a conspiracy of our equals, or the corruption of servants, or letters written against thee? though indeed there are none of those things but have sometimes been pretended by way of calumny, when they were never done; for a royal family that is at variance with itself is a terrible thing; and that which thou callest a reward of piety often becomes, among very wicked men, such a foundation of hope, as makes them leave no sort of mischief untried. Nor does any one lay any wicked practices to our charge; but as to calumnies by hearsay, how can he put an end to them, who will not hear what we have to say? Have we talked with too great freedom? Yes; but not against thee, for that would be unjust, but against those that never conceal any thing that is spoken to them. Hath either of us lamented our mother? Yes; but not because she is dead, but because she was evil spoken of by those that had no reason so to do. Are we desirous of that dominion which we know our father is possessed of? For what reason can we do so? If we already have royal honors, as we have, should not we labor in vain? And if we have them not, yet are not we in hopes of them? Or supposing that we had killed thee, could we expect to obtain thy kingdom? while neither the earth would let us tread upon it, nor the sea let us sail upon it, after such an action as that; nay, the religion of all your subjects, and the piety of the whole nation, would have prohibited parricides from assuming the government, and from entering into that most holy <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> which was built by thee But suppose we had made light of other dangers, can any murderer go off unpunished while <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is alive? We are thy sons, and not so impious or so thoughtless as that comes to, though perhaps more unfortunate than is convenient for thee. But in case thou neither findest any causes of complaint, nor any treacherous designs, what sufficient evidence hast thou to make such a wickedness of ours credible? Our mother is dead indeed, but then what befell her might be an instruction to us to caution, and not an incitement to wickedness. We are willing to make a larger apology for ourselves; but actions never done do not admit of discourse. Nay, we will make this agreement with thee, and that before <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, the lord of all, who is now a mediator between us, If thou, O father, canst bring thyself, by the evidence of truth, to have a mind free from suspicion concerning us let us live, though even then we shall live in an unhappy way, for to be accused of great acts of wickedness, though falsely, is a terrible thing; but if thou hast any fear remaining, continue thou on in thy pious life, we will give this reason for our own conduct; our life is not so desirable to us as to desire to have it, if it tend to the harm of our father who gave it us. </p>                        </div>

He also exhorted <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> to lay all such suspicions aside, and to be reconciled to his sons; for that it was not just to give any credit to such reports concerning his own children; and that this repentance on both sides might still heal those breaches that had happened between them, and might improve that their good-will to one another, whereby those on both sides, excusing the rashness of their suspicions, might resolve to bear a greater degree of affection towards each other than they had before.

There was accordingly a great festival and most sumptuous preparations made presently, in order to its dedication; for he had appointed a contention in music, and games to be performed naked. He had also gotten ready a great number of those that fight single combats, and of beasts for the like purpose; <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> races also, and the most chargeable of such sports and shows as used to be exhibited at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and in other places. He consecrated this combat to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and ordered it to be celebrated every fifth year. He also sent all sorts of ornaments for it out of his own furniture, that it might want nothing to make it decent; nay, <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wife, sent a great part of her most valuable furniture [from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>], insomuch that he had no want of any thing.

As to his own court, therefore, if any one was not very obsequious to him in his language, and would not confess himself to be his slave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his government, he was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his very kindred and friends, and punished them as if they were enemies and this wickedness he undertook out of a desire that he might be himself alone honored. Now for this, my assertion about that passion of his, we have the greatest evidence, by what he did to honor <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/91 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, and his other friends; for with what honors he paid his respects to them who were his superiors, the same did he desire to be paid to himself; and what he thought the most excellent present he could make another, he discovered an inclination to have the like presented to himself. But now the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation is by their law a stranger to all such things, and accustomed to prefer righteousness to glory; for which reason that nation was not agreeable to him, because it was out of their power to flatter the king's ambition with statues or temples, or any other such performances; And this seems to me to have been at once the occasion of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s crimes as to his own courtiers and counselors, and of his benefactions as to foreigners and those that had no relation to him. </p>                        </div>

As for any money, he found none, as <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> had done, but that furniture of gold, and those precious goods that were laid up there; all which he took away. However, he had a great desire to make a more diligent search, and to go farther in, even as far as the very bodies of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> and <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>; where two of his guards were slain, by a flame that burst out upon those that went in, as the report was. So he was terribly affrighted, and went out, and built a propitiatory monument of that fright he had been in; and this of white stone, at the mouth of the sepulcher, and that at great expense also. And even <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> his historiographer makes mention of this monument built by <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, though he does not mention his going down into the sepulcher, as knowing that action to be of ill repute; and many other things he treats of in the same manner in his book; for he wrote in <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s lifetime, and under his reign, and so as to please him, and as a servant to him, touching upon nothing but what tended to his glory, and openly excusing many of his notorious crimes, and very diligently concealing them. And as he was desirous to put handsome colors on the death of <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> and her sons, which were barbarous actions in the king, he tells falsehoods about the incontinence of <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>, and the treacherous designs of his sons upon him; and thus he proceeded in his whole work, making a pompous encomium upon what just actions he had done, but earnestly apologizing for his unjust ones. Indeed, a man, as I said, may have a great deal to say by way of excuse for <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a>; for he did not so properly write this as a history for others, as somewhat that might be subservient to the king himself. As for ourselves, who come of a family nearly allied to the Asamonean kings, and on that account have an honorable place, which is the priesthood, we think it indecent to say any thing that is false about them, and accordingly we have described their actions after an unblemished and upright manner. And although we reverence many of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s posterity, who still reign, yet do we pay a greater regard to truth than to them, and this though it sometimes happens that we incur their displeasure by so doing. </p>                        </div>

However, <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> used stratagems perpetually against his brethren, and that very cunningly; while abroad he loaded them with accusations, but still took upon him frequently to apologize for them, that this apparent benevolence to them might make him be believed, and forward his attempts against them; by which means he, after various manners, circumvented his father, who believed all that he did was for his preservation. <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> also recommended <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, who was a great director of the affairs of his kingdom, to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>; and consulted with his mother about the public affairs also.

So upon <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s unworthy refusal, he gave the damsel to <a href=/people/1335 target=_blank>Phasaelus</a>'s son; but after some time, when he thought the heat of his brother's affections was over, he blamed him for his former conduct, and desired him to take his second daughter, whose name was Cypros. <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> also advised him to leave off affronting his brother, and to forsake her whom he had loved, for that it was a base thing to be so enamored of a servant, as to deprive himself of the king's good-will to him, and become an occasion of his trouble, and make himself hated by him. <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> knew that this advice would be for his own advantage, particularly because he had been accused before, and forgiven; so he put his wife away, although he already had a son by her, and engaged to the king that he would take his second daughter, and agreed that the thirtieth day after should be the day of marriage; and sware he would have no further conversation with her whom he had put away; but when the thirty days were over, he was such a slave to his affections, that he no longer performed any thing he had promised, but continued still with his former wife. This occasioned <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> to grieve openly, and made him angry, while the king dropped one word or other against <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> perpetually; and many made the king's anger an opportunity for raising calumnies against him. Nor had the king any longer a single quiet day or hour, but occasions of one fresh quarrel or another arose among his relations, and those that were dearest to him; for <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> was of a harsh temper, and ill-natured to <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a>'s sons; nor would she suffer her own daughter, who was the wife of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, one of those young men, to bear a good-will to her husband, but persuaded her to tell her if he said any thing to her in private, and when any misunderstandings happened, as is common, she raised a great many suspicions out of it; by which means she learned all their concerns, and made the damsel ill-natured to the young man. And in order to gratify her mother, she often said that the young men used to mention <a href=/people/1244 target=_blank>Mariamne</a> when they were by themselves; and that they hated their father, and were continually threatening, that if they had once got the kingdom, they would make <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s sons by his other wives country schoolmasters, for that the present education which was given them, and their diligence in learning, fitted them for such an employment. And as for the women, whenever they saw them adorned with their mother's clothes, they threatened, that instead of their present gaudy apparel, they should be clothed in sackcloth, and confined so closely that they should not see the light of the sun. These stories were presently carried by <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> to the king, who was troubled to hear them, and endeavored to make up matters; but these suspicions afflicted him, and becoming more and more uneasy, he believed every body against every body. However, upon his rebuking his sons, and hearing the defense they made for themselves, he was easier for a while, though a little afterwards much worse accidents came upon him. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> heard that, he was all on fire, from his youth and jealousy; and he interpreted the instances of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s obliging behavior to her, which were very frequent, for the worse, which came from those suspicions he had on account of that word which fell from <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>; nor could he conceal his grief at the thing, but informed him what word: <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> had said. Upon which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was in a greater disorder than ever; and not bearing such a false calumny, which was to his shame, was much disturbed at it; and often did he lament the wickedness of his domestics, and how good he had been to them, and how ill requitals they had made him. So he sent for <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, and reproached him, and said, Thou vilest of all men! art thou come to that unmeasurable and extravagant degree of ingratitude, as not only to suppose such things of me, but to speak of them? I now indeed perceive what thy intentions are. It is not thy only aim to reproach me, when thou usest such words to my son, but thereby to persuade him to plot against me, and get me destroyed by poison. And who is there, if he had not a good genius at his elbow, as hath my son, but would not bear such a suspicion of his father, but would revenge himself upon him? Dost thou suppose that thou hast only dropped a word for him to think of, and not rather hast put a sword into his hand to slay his father? And what dost thou mean, when thou really hatest both him and his brother, to pretend kindness to them, only in order to raise a reproach against me, and talk of such things as no one but such an impious wretch as thou art could either devise in their mind, or declare in their words? Begone, thou art such a plague to thy benefactor and thy brother, and may that evil conscience of thine go along with thee; while I still overcome my relations by kindness, and am so far from avenging myself of them, as they deserve, that I bestow greater benefits upon them than they are worthy of. </p>                        </div>

But as soon as she heard that, for she was at hand, she cried out, like one that would be believed, that no such thing ever came out of her mouth; that they all earnestly endeavored to make the king hate her, and to make her away, because of the good-will she bore to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and because she was always foreseeing the dangers that were coming upon him, and that at present there were more plots against him than usual; for while she was the only person who persuaded her brother to put away the wife he now had, and to take the king's daughter, it was no wonder if she were hated by him. As she said this, and often tore her hair, and often beat her breast, her countenance made her denial to be believed; but the peverseness of her manners declared at the same time her dissimulation in these proceedings; but <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> was caught between them, and had nothing plausible to offer in his own defense, while he confessed that he had said what was charged upon him, but was not believed when he said he had heard it from <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>; so the confusion among them was increased, and their quarrelsome words one to another. At last the king, out of his hatred to his brother and sister, sent them both away; and when he had commended the moderation of his son, and that he had himself told him of the report, he went in the evening to refresh himself. After such a contest as this had fallen out among them, <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>'s reputation suffered greatly, since she was supposed to have first raised the calumny; and the king's wives were grieved at her, as knowing she was a very ill-natured woman, and would sometimes be a friend, and sometimes an enemy, at different seasons: so they perpetually said one thing or another against her; and somewhat that now fell out made them the bolder in speaking against her. </p>                        </div>

He was a shrewd man, although he was but young, and was handsome withal. This <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>, upon some occasion coining to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and supping with him, saw <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, and set his heart upon her; and understanding that she was a widow, he discoursed with her. Now because <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> was at this time less in favor with her brother, she looked upon <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> with some passion, and was very earnest to be married to him; and on the days following there appeared many, and those very great, indications of their agreement together. Now the women carried this news to the king, and laughed at the indecency of it; whereupon <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> inquired about it further of <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, and desired him to observe them at supper, how their behavior was one toward another; who told him, that by the signals which came from their heads and their eyes, they both were evidently in love. After this, <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=person long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> being suspected, went away, but came again in two or three months afterwards, as it were on that very design, and spake to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> about it, and desired that <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> might be given him to wife; for that his affinity might not be disadvantageous to his affairs, by a union with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, the government of which country was already in effect under his power, and more evidently would be his hereafter. Accordingly, when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> discoursed with his sister about it, and asked her whether she were disposed to this match, she immediately agreed to it. But when <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> was desired to come over to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> religion, and then he should marry her, and that it was impossible to do it on any other terms, he could not bear that proposal, and went his way; for he said, that if he should do so, he should be stoned by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>. Then did <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> reproach <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> for her incontinency, as did the women much more; and said that <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> had debauched her. As for that damsel which the king had betrothed to his brother <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, but he had not taken her, as I have before related, because he was enamored on his former wife, <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> desired of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> she might be given to her son by <a href=/people/3372 target=_blank>Costobarus</a>; which match he was very willing to, but was dissuaded from it by <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, who pleaded that this young man would not be kind to her, since his father had been slain by him, and that it was more just that his son, who was to be his successor in the tetrarchy, should have her. So he begged his pardon, and persuaded him to do so. Accordingly the damsel, upon this change of her espousals, was disposal of to this young man, the son of <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, the king giving for her portion a hundred talents. </p>                        </div>

When therefore <a href=/people/1040 target=_blank>Andromachus</a> and his friends were driven away, and had no discourse nor freedom with the king any longer, the king, in the first place, examined by torture all whom he thought to be faithful to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, Whether they knew of any of his attempts against him; but these died without having any thing to say to that matter, which made the king more zealous [after discoveries], when he could not find out what evil proceedings he suspected them of. As for <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, he was very sagacious to raise a calumny against those that were really innocent, as if their denial was only their constancy and fidelity [to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>], and thereupon provoked <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> to discover by the torture of great numbers what attempts were still concealed. Now there was a certain person among the many that were tortured, who said that he knew that the young man had often said, that when he was commended as a tall man in his body, and a skillful marksman, and that in his other commendable exercises he exceeded all men, these qualifications given him by nature, though good in themselves, were not advantageous to him, because his father was grieved at them, and envied him for them; and that when he walked along with his father, he endeavored to depress and shorten himself, that he might not appear too tall; and that when he shot at any thing as he was hunting, when his father was by, he missed his mark on purpose, for he knew how ambitious his father was of being superior in such exercises. So when the man was tormented about this saying, and had ease given his body after it, he added, that he had his brother <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> for his assistance, and contrived to lie in wait for their father, as they were hunting, and kill him; and when they had done so to fly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and desire to have the kingdom given them. There were also letters of the young man found, written to his brother, wherein he complained that his father did not act justly in giving <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> a country, whose [yearly] revenues amounted to two hundred talents. Upon these confessions <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> presently thought he had somewhat to depend on, in his own opinion, as to his suspicion about his sons; so he took up <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> and bound him: yet did he still continue to be uneasy, and was not quite satisfied of the truth of what he had heard; and when he came to recollect himself, he found that they had only made juvenile complaints and contentions, and that it was an incredible thing, that when his son should have slain him, he should openly go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> [to beg the kingdom]; so he was desirous to have some surer mark of his son's wickedness, and was very solicitous about it, that he might not appear to have condemned him to be put in prison too rashly; so he tortured the principal of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s friends, and put not a few of them to death, without getting any of the things out of them which he suspected. And while <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was very busy about this matter, and the palace was full of terror and trouble, one of the younger sort, when he was in the utmost agony, confessed that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had sent to his friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and desired that he might be quickly invited thither by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and that he could discover a plot against him; that <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, was joined in friendship with his father against the Romans, and that he had a poisonous potion ready prepared at Askelori. </p>                        </div>

As for <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he was very desirous to aggravate the vast misfortunes he was under, so he pretended not to deny the accusations, but punished the rashness of his father with a greater crime of his own; and perhaps he was willing to make his father ashamed of his easy belief of such calumnies: he aimed especially, if he could gain belief to his story, to plague him and his whole kingdom; for he wrote four letters, and sent them to him, that he did not need to torture any more persons, for he had plotted against him; and that he had for his partners <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> and the most faithful of his friends; and that <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> came in to him by night, and that she lay with him whether he would or not; and that all men were come to be of one mind, to make away with him as soon as they could, and so get clear of the continual fear they were in from him.

So when <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> had brought him to a more moderate temper, he transferred the calumnies upon his friends; and said it must be owing to them that so young a man, and one unacquainted with malice, was corrupted; and he supposed that there was more reason to suspect the brother than the soft. Upon which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was very much displeased at <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, who indeed now had no one that could make a reconciliation between him and his brother. So when he saw that <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> had the greatest power with <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, he betook himself to him in the habit of a mourner, and like one that had all the signs upon him of an undone man. Upon this <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> did not overlook the intercession he made to him, nor yet did he undertake to change the king's disposition towards him immediately; and he said that it was better for him to come himself to the king, and confess himself the occasion of all; that this would make the king's anger not to be extravagant towards him, and that then he would be present to assist him. When he had persuaded him to this, he gained his point with both of them; and the calumnies raised against the young man were, beyond all expectation, wiped off. And <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, as soon as he had made the reconciliation, went then away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, having proved at this juncture of time the most acceptable person to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> in the world; on which account he gave him the richest presents, as tokens of his respects to him; and being on other occasions magnanimous, he esteemed him one of his dearest friends. He also made an agreement with him that he would go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, because he had written to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> about these affairs; so they went together as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, and there <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> made a reconciliation between <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> and Titus, the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, who had been greatly at variance, and so returned back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>. </p>                        </div>

However, at the first the king would not permit them to rob, and so they abstained from that unjust way of living upon their neighbors, which procured <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> a great reputation for his care. But when he was sailing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, it was at that time when he went to accuse his son <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and to commit <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s protection, the Trachonites spread a report as if he were dead, and revolted from his dominion, and betook themselves again to their accustomed way of robbing their neighbors; at which time the king's commanders subdued them during his absence; but about forty of the principal robbers, being terrified by those that had been taken, left the country, and retired into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> entertaining them, after he had missed of marrying <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, and gave them a place of strength, in which they dwelt.

Then did he discourse about these robberies to <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> and <a href=/people/1860 target=_blank>Volumnius</a>, and required that they should be punished; upon which occasion they still the more confirmed themselves in their robberies, and became more numerous, and made very great disturbances, laying waste the countries and villages that belonged to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s kingdom, and killing those men whom they caught, till these unjust proceedings came to be like a real war, for the robbers were now become about a thousand; — at which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was sore displeased, and required the robbers, as well as the money which he had lent <a href=/people/3437 target=_blank>Obodas</a>, by <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>, which was sixty talents, and since the time of payment was now past, he desired to have it paid him; but <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>, who had laid <a href=/people/3437 target=_blank>Obodas</a> aside, and managed all by himself, denied that the robbers were in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, and put off the payment of the money; about which there was a hearing before <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> and <a href=/people/1860 target=_blank>Volumnius</a>, who were then the presidents of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>.

Its progress and augmentation at this time arose on the occasion following: One <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a>, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonian</a>, (a person of note there, but a man of a perverse mind, and so cunning in his ways of voluptuousness and flattery, as to indulge both, and yet seem to indulge neither of them,) came in his travels to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and made him presents, but so that he received more presents from him. He also took such proper seasons for insinuating himself into his friendship, that he became one of the most intimate of the king's friends. He had his lodging in <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s house; but he had not only access, but free conversation, with <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, as pretending to him that he was in great favor with <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>; whence he pretended much respect to <a href=/people/3028 target=_blank>Glaphyra</a>, and in an occult manner cultivated a friendship with them all; but always attending to what was said and done, that he might be furnished with calumnies to please them all. In short, he behaved himself so to every body in his conversation, as to appear to be his particular friend, and he made others believe that his being any where was for that person's advantage. So he won upon <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who was but young; and persuaded him that he might open his grievances to him with assurance and with nobody else. So he declared his grief to him, how his father was alienated from him. He related to him also the affairs of his mother, and of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>; that he had driven them from their proper dignity, and had the power over every thing himself; that no part of this was tolerable, since his father was already come to hate them; and he added, that he would neither admit them to his table, nor to his conversation. Such were the complaints, as was but natural, of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> about the things that troubled him; and these discourses <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> carried to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, and told him he did not inform him of this on his own account, but that being overcome by his kindness, the great importance of the thing obliged him to do it; and he warned him to have a care of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, for that what he said was spoken with vehemency, and that, in consequence of what he said, he would certainly kill him with his own hand. Whereupon <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, thinking him to be his friend by this advice, gave him presents upon all occasions, and at length persuaded him to inform <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> of what he had heard. So when he related to the king <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s ill temper, as discovered by the words he had heard him speak, he was easily believed by him; and he thereby brought the king to that pass, turning him about by his words, and irritating him, till he increased his hatred to him and made him implacable, which he showed at that very time, for he immediately gave <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> a present of fifty talents; who, when he had gotten them, went to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and commended <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> before him, and told him that he had been many ways of advantage to him, in making a reconciliation between him and his father. So he got money from him also, and went away, before his pernicious practices were found out; but when <a href=/people/2517 target=_blank>Eurycles</a> was returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a>, he did not leave off doing mischief; and so, for his many acts of injustice, he was banished from his own country. </p>                        </div>

So when the cause was ready for a hearing, and the day was appointed, <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a>, while <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>'s ambassadors were present, accused <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>, and said that he imputed to him the destruction of the king [<a href=/people/3437 target=_blank>Obodas</a>], and of many others of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>; that he had borrowed money for no good design; and he proved that he had been guilty of adultery, not only with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a>, but Reinan women also. And. he added, that above all the rest he had alienated <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and that all that he had said about the actions of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> were falsities. When <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> was come to this topic, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> stopped him from going on, and desired him only to speak to this affair of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and to show that he had not led an army into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, nor slain two thousand five hundred men there, nor taken prisoners, nor pillaged the country. To which <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> made this answer: I shall principally demonstrate, that either nothing at all, or but a very little, of those imputations are true, of which thou hast been informed; for had they been true, thou mightest justly have been still more angry at <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>. At this strange assertion <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was very attentive; and <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> said that there was a debt due to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> of five hundred talents, and a bond, wherein it was written, that if the time appointed be lapsed, it should be lawful to make a seizure out of any part of his country. As for the pretended army, he said, it was no army, but a party sent out to require the just payment of the money; that this was not sent immediately, nor so soon as the bond allowed, but that <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> had frequently come before <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> and <a href=/people/1860 target=_blank>Volumnius</a>, the presidents of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>; and that at last he had sworn at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339355UBer class=place long=35.5056 lat=33.896>Berytus</a>, by thy fortune, that he would certainly pay the money within thirty days, and deliver up the fugitives that were under his dominion. And that when <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> had performed nothing of this, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> came again before the presidents; and upon their permission to make a seizure for his money, he, with difficulty, went out of his country with a party of soldiers for that purpose. And this is all the war which these men so tragically describe; and this is the affair of the expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>. And how can this be called a war, when thy presidents permitted it, the covenants allowed it, and it was not executed till thy name, O <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, as well as that of the other gods, had been profaned? And now I must speak in order about the captives. There were robbers that dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329364RTra class=place long=36.4 lat=32.9>Trachonitis</a>; at first their number was no more than forty, but they became more afterwards, and they escaped the punishment <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> would have inflicted on them, by making <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> their refuge. <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> received them, and supported them with food, that they might be mischievous to all mankind, and gave them a country to inhabit, and himself received the gains they made by robbery; yet did he promise that he would deliver up these men, and that by the same oaths and same time that he sware and fixed for payment of his debt: nor can he by any means show that any other persons have at this time been taken out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> besides these, and indeed not all these neither, but only so many as could not conceal themselves. And thus does the calumny of the captives, which hath been so odiously represented, appear to be no better than a fiction and a lie, made on purpose to provoke thy indignation; for I venture to affirm that when the forces of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> came upon us, and one or two of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s party fell, he then only defended himself, and there fell <a href=/people/9853 target=_blank>Nacebus</a> their general, and in all about twenty-five others, and no more; whence <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>, by multiplying every single soldier to a hundred, he reckons the slain to have been two thousand five hundred. </p>                        </div>

When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had read them, he thought it would not be proper to add another government to him, now he was old, and in an ill state with relation to his sons, so he admitted <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>'s ambassadors; and after he had just reproved him for his rashness, in not tarrying till he received the kingdom from him, he accepted of his presents, and confirmed him in his government. </p>                        </div>

He had sons of his own, and to put one's son to death is a greater misfortune than any other that could befall him by their means.

Accordingly, of the two other causes of this sad event, any body may lay the blame on the young men, who acted by youthful vanity, and pride of their royal birth, that they should bear to hear the calumnies that were raised against their father, while certainly they were not equitable judges of the actions of his life, but ill-natured in suspecting, and intemperate in speaking of it, and on both accounts easily caught by those that observed them, and revealed them to gain favor; yet cannot their father be thought worthy excuse, as to that horrid impiety which he was guilty of about them, while he ventured, without any certain evidence of their treacherous designs against him, and without any proofs that they had made preparations for such attempt, to kill his own sons, who were of very comely bodies, and the great darlings of other men, and no way deficient in their conduct, whether it were in hunting, or in warlike exercises, or in speaking upon occasional topics of discourse; for in all these they were skillful, and especially <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, who was the eldest; for certainly it had been sufficient, even though he had condemned them, to have kept them alive in bonds, or to let them live at a distance from his dominions in banishment, while he was surrounded by the Roman forces, which were a strong security to him, whose help would prevent his suffering any thing by a sudden onset, or by open force; but for him to kill them on the sudden, in order to gratify a passion that governed him, was a demonstration of insufferable impiety. He also was guilty of so great a crime in his older age; nor will the delays that he made, and the length of time in which the thing was done, plead at all for his excuse; for when a man is on a sudden amazed, and in commotion of mind, and then commits a wicked action, although this be a heavy crime, yet is it a thing that frequently happens; but to do it upon deliberation, and after frequent attempts, and as frequent puttings-off, to undertake it at last, and accomplish it, was the action of a murderous mind, and such as was not easily moved from that which is evil. And this temper he showed in what he did afterward, when he did not spare those that seemed to be the best beloved of his friends that were left, wherein, though the justice of the punishment caused those that perished to be the less pitied, yet was the barbarity of the man here equal, in that he did not abstain from their slaughter also. But of those persons we shall have occasion to discourse more hereafter. </p>                        </div>

FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER AND ARISTOBULUS TO THE BANISHMENT OF ARCHELAUS. WHEN <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> had thus taken off his brethren, and had brought his father into the highest degree of impiety, till he was haunted with furies for what he had done, his hopes did not succeed to his mind, as to the rest of his life; for although he was delivered from the fear of his brethren being his rivals as to the government, yet did he find it a very hard thing, and almost impracticable, to come at the kingdom, because the hatred of the nation against him on that account was become very great; and besides this very disagreeable circumstance, the affair of the soldiery grieved him still more, who were alienated from him, from which yet these kings derived all the safety which they had, whenever they found the nation desirous of innovation: and all this danger was drawn upon him by his destruction of his brethren. However, he governed the nation jointly with his father, being indeed no other than a king already; and he was for that very reason trusted, and the more firmly depended on, for the which he ought himself to have been put to death, as appearing to have betrayed his brethren out of his concern for the preservation of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and not rather out of his ill-will to them, and, before them, to his father himself: and this was the accursed state he was in. Now all <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s contrivances tended to make his way to take off <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, that he might have nobody to accuse him in the vile practices he was devising: and that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> might have no refuge, nor any to afford him their assistance, since they must thereby have <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> for their open enemy; insomuch that the very plots he had laid against his brethren were occasioned by the hatred he bore his father. But at this time he was more than ever set upon the execution of his attempts against <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, because if he were once dead, the government would now be firmly secured to him; but if he were suffered to live any longer, he should be in danger, upon a discovery of that wickedness of which he had been the contriver, and his father would of necessity then become his enemy. And on this account it was that he became very bountiful to his father's friends, and bestowed great sums on several of them, in order to surprise men with his good deeds, and take off their hatred against him. And he sent great presents to his friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> particularly, to gain their good-will; and above all to <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>, the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. He also hoped to gain the favor of <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>'s brother with the large presents he bestowed on him; as also he used the same art to [<a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>] the king's sister, who had married one of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s chief friends. And when he counterfeited friendship to those with whom he conversed, he was very subtle in gaining their belief, and very cunning to hide his hatred against any that he really did hate. But he could not impose upon his aunt, who understood him of a long time, and was a woman not easily to be deluded, especially while she had already used all possible caution in preventing his pernicious designs. Although Antipeter's uncle by the mother's side was married to her daughter, and this by his own connivance and management, while she had before been married to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, and while <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>'s other daughter by that husband was married to the son of <a href=/people/6318 target=_blank>Calleas</a>; yet that marriage was no obstacle to her, who knew how wicked he was, in her discovering his designs, as her former kindred to him could not prevent her hatred of him. Now <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had compelled <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, while she was in love with <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=person long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a>, and had taken a fondness for him, to marry <a href=/people/3329 target=_blank>Alexas</a>; which match was by her submitted to at the instance of <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, who persuaded <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> not to refuse it, lest she should herself be their open enemy, since <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had sworn that he would never be friends with <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, if she would not accept of <a href=/people/3329 target=_blank>Alexas</a> for her husband; so she submitted to <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a> as being <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wife; and besides that, she advised her to nothing but what was very much for her own advantage. At this time also it was that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> sent back king <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>'s daughter, who had been <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s wife, to her father, returning the portion he had with her out of his own estate, that there might be no dispute between them about it. </p>                        </div>

He also caused them to be betrothed against they should come to the proper age of marriage; the elder of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s sons to <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s daughter, and <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s daughter to <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>'s eldest son.

Now the king made these espousals for the children, out of commiseration of them now they were fatherless, as endeavoring to render <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> kind to them by these intermarriages. But <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> did not fail to bear the same temper of mind to his brothers' children which he had borne to his brothers themselves; and his father's concern about them provoked his indignation against them upon this supposal, that they would become greater than ever his brothers had been; while <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, a king, would support his daughter's sons, and <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, a tetrarch, would accept of one of the daughters as a wife to his son. What provoked him also was this, that all the multitude would so commiserate these fatherless children, and so hate him [for making them fatherless], that all would come out, since they were no strangers to his vile disposition towards his brethren. He contrived, therefore, to overturn his father's settlements, as thinking it a terrible thing that they should be so related to him, and be so powerful withal. So <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> yielded to him, and changed his resolution at his entreaty; and the determination now was, that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> himself should marry <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>'s daughter, and <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s son should marry <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s daughter.

He was also formidable to all, not so much on account of the power and authority he had, as for the shrewdness of his vile attempts beforehand; but he who principally cultivated a friendship with him was <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, who received the like marks of his friendship; while <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> had cunningly encompassed him about by a company of women, whom he placed as guards about him; for <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> was greatly enslaved to his wife, and to her mother, and to her sister; and this notwithstanding the hatred he bare them for the indignities they had offered to his virgin daughters. Yet did he bear them, and nothing was to he done without the women, who had got this man into their circle, and continued still to assist each other in all things, insomuch that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> was entirely addicted to them, both by himself and by his mother; for these four women, said all one and the same thing; but the opinions of <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> and <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> were different in some points of no consequence. But the king's sister [<a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>] was their antagonist, who for a good while had looked about all their affairs, and was apprized that this their friendship was made in order to do <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> some mischief, and was disposed to inform the king of it. And since these people knew that their friendship was very disagreeable to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, as tending to do him a mischief, they contrived that their meetings should not be discovered; so they pretended to hate one another, and to abuse one another when time served, and especially when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was present, or when any one was there that would tell him: but still their intimacy was firmer than ever, when they were private. And this was the course they took. But they could not conceal from <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> neither their first contrivance, when they set about these their intentions, nor when they had made some progress in them; but she searched out every thing; and, aggravating the relations to her brother, declared to him, as well their secret assemblies and compotations, as their counsels taken in a clandestine manner, which if they were not in order to destroy him, they might well enough have been open and public. But to appearance they are at variance, and speak about one another as if they intended one another a mischief, but agree so well together when they are out of the sight of the multitude; for when they are alone by themselves, they act in concert, and profess that they will never leave off their friendship, but will fight against those from whom they conceal their designs. And thus did she search out these things, and get a perfect knowledge of them, and then told her brother of them, who understood also of himself a great deal of what she said, but still durst not depend upon it, because of the suspicions he had of his sister's calumnies. For there was a certain sect of men that were <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, who valued themselves highly upon the exact skill they had in the law of their fathers, and made men believe they were highly favored by God, by whom this set of women were inveigled. These are those that are called the sect of the Pharisees, who were in a capacity of greatly opposing kings. A cunning sect they were, and soon elevated to a pitch of open fighting and doing mischief. Accordingly, when all the people of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> gave assurance of their good-will to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and to the king's government, these very men did not swear, being above six thousand; and when the king imposed a fine upon them, <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s wife paid their fine for them. In order to requite which kindness of hers, since they were believed to have the foreknowledge of things to come by Divine inspiration, they foretold how God had decreed that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s government should cease, and his posterity should be deprived of it; but that the kingdom should come to her and <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, and to their children. These predictions were not concealed from <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, but were told the king; as also how they had perverted some persons about the palace itself; so the king slew such of the Pharisees as were principally accused, and <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a> the eunuch, and one <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a>, who exceeded all men of that time in comeliness, and one that was his catamite. He slew also all those of his own family who had consented to what the Pharisees foretold; and for <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a>, he had been puffed up by them, as though he should be named the father and the benefactor of him who, by the prediction, was foretold to be their appointed king; for that this king would have all things in his power, and would enable <a href=/people/957 target=_blank>Bagoas</a> to marry, and to have children of his own body begotten. </p>                        </div>

And now, <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, if thou valuest thy relation to me, put this wife of thine away; for by this means thou wilt continue to be a brother to me, and wilt abide in thy love to me.

Hereupon <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> put off his anger against <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> on these accounts, although he himself thereby underwent a very uneasy punishment.

When he was moved with these words, for they seemed to him to be true, they said that <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> supped with his wife the day before he fell sick, and that a certain potion was brought him in such a sort of food as he was not used to eat; but that when he had eaten, he died of it: that this potion was brought out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> by a woman, under pretense indeed as a love-potion, for that was its name, but in reality to kill <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>; for that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=demonym long=40 lat=28>Arabian</a> women are skillful in making such poisons: and the woman to whom they ascribe this was confessedly a most intimate friend of one of <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>'s mistresses; and that both the mother and the sister of <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s wife had been at the places where she lived, and had persuaded her to sell them this potion, and had come back and brought it with them the day before that his supper. Hereupon the king was provoked, and put the women slaves to the torture, and some that were free with them; and as the fact did not yet appear, because none of them would confess it, at length one of them, under the utmost agonies, said no more but this, that she prayed that God would send the like agonies upon <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s mother, who had been the occasion of these miseries to all of them.

He also had accused the king of great barbarity, and of the slaughter of his sons; and that it was out of the fear he was under, lest he should do the like to him, that made him contrive this his journey to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> contrive to go to his own tetrarchy. </p>                        </div>

But he who most of all irritated the king against his son was one <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, the procurator of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> the king's son, who, when he was tortured, among other things, said that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> had prepared a deadly potion, and given it to <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>, with his desire that he would give it to his father during his absence, and when he was too remote to have the least suspicion cast upon him thereto relating; that <a href=/people/1199 target=_blank>Antiphilus</a>, one of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s friends, brought that potion out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and that it was sent to <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> by Thendion, the brother of the mother of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, the king's son, and by that means came to <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s wife, her husband having given it her to keep. And when the king asked her about it, she confessed it; and as she was running to fetch it, she threw herself down from the house-top; yet did she not kill herself, because she fell upon her feet; by which means, when the king had comforted her, and had promised her and her domestics pardon, upon condition of their concealing nothing of the truth from him, but had threatened her with the utmost miseries if she proved ungrateful [and concealed any thing]: so she promised, and swore that she would speak out every thing, and tell after what manner every thing was done; and said what many took to be entirely true, that the potion was brought out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by <a href=/people/1199 target=_blank>Antiphilus</a>; and that his brother, who was a physician, had procured it; and that when Thendion brought it us, she kept it upon <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s committing it to her; and that it was prepared by <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> for thee. When, therefore, <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a> was fallen sick, and thou camest to him and tookest care of him, and when he saw the kindness thou hadst for him, his mind was overborne thereby. So he called me to him, and said to me, O woman! <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> hath circumvented me in this affair of his father and my brother, by persuading me to have a murderous intention to him, and procuring a potion to be subservient thereto; do thou, therefore, go and fetch my potion, (since my brother appears to have still the same virtuous disposition towards me which he had formerly, and I do not expect to live long myself, and that I may not defile my forefathers by the murder of a brother,) and burn it before my face:' that accordingly she immediately brought it, and did as her husband bade her; and that she burnt the greatest part of the potion; but that a little of it was left, that if the king, after <a href=/people/909 target=_blank>Pheroras</a>'s death, should treat her ill, she might poison herself, and thereby get clear of her miseries. Upon her saying thus, she brought out the potion, and the box in which it was, before them all. Nay, there was another brother of <a href=/people/1199 target=_blank>Antiphilus</a>, and his mother also, who, by the extremity of pain and torture, confessed the same things, and owned the box [to be that which had been brought out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>]. The high priest's daughter also, who was the king's wife, was accused to have been conscious of all this, and had resolved to conceal it; for which reason <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> divorced her, and blotted her son out of his testament, wherein he had been mentioned as one that was to reign after him; and he took the high priesthood away from his father-in-law, <a href=/people/4689 target=_blank>Simeon</a> the son of <a href=/people/1395 target=_blank>Boethus</a>, and appointed <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a> the son of <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>, who was born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, to be high priest in his room. </p>                        </div>

At the same time also he made some little complaint about his mother, but promised that he would lay those complaints aside when he should return. He withal expressed his entire affection for him, as fearing lest he should have some suspicion of him, and defer his journey to him; and lest, while he lived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he should lay plots for the kingdom, and, moreover, do somewhat against himself.

Now some of his friends advised him that he should tarry a while some where, in expectation of further information. But others advised him to sail home without delay; for that if he were once come thither, he would soon put an end to all accusations, and that nothing afforded any weight to his accusers at present but his absence. He was persuaded by these last, and sailed on, and landed at the haven called Sebastus, which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had built at vast expenses in honor of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and called Sebastus. And now was <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> evidently in a miserable condition, while nobody came to him nor saluted him, as they did at his going away, with good wishes of joyful acclamations; nor was there now any thing to hinder them from entertaining him, on the contrary, with bitter curses, while they supposed he was come to receive his punishment for the murder of his brethren. </p>                        </div>

Then did <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> fall down at his father's feet, and besought him not to prejudge his cause, but that he might be first heard by his father, and that his father would keep himself unprejudiced.

Upon which <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, in order to make his legal defense, turned himself to his father, and enlarged upon the many indications he had given of his good-will to him; and instanced in the honors that had been done him, which yet had not been done, had he not deserved them by his virtuous concern about him; for that he had made provision for every thing that was fit to be foreseen beforehand, as to giving him his wisest advice; and whenever there was occasion for the labor of his own hands, he had not grudged any such pains for him. And that it was almost impossible that he, who had delivered his father from so many treacherous contrivances laid against him, should be himself in a plot against him, and so lose all the reputation he had gained for his virtue, by his wickedness which succeeded it; and this while he had nothing to prohibit him, who was already appointed his successor, to enjoy the royal honor with his father also at present; and that there was no likelihood that a person who had the one half of that authority without any danger, and with a good character, should hunt after the whole with infamy and danger, and this when it was doubtful whether he could obtain it or not; and when he saw the sad example of his brethren before him, and was both the informer and the accuser against them, at a time when they might not otherwise have been discovered; nay, was the author of the punishment inflicted upon them, when it appeared evidently that they were guilty of a wicked attempt against their father; and that even the contentions there were in the king's family were indications that he had ever managed affairs out of the sincerest affection to his father.

Moreover he showed the weakness of the evidence obtained by torture, which was commonly false, because the distress men are in under such tortures naturally obliges them to say many things in order to please those that govern them.

Then did <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> begin to prosecute what the king had begun, and that with great bitterness; and summed up all the evidence which arose from the tortures, or from the testimonies. He principally and largely cried up the king's virtues, which he had exhibited in the maintenance and education of his sons; while he never could gain any advantage thereby, but still fell from one misfortune to another. Although he owned that he was not so much surprised with that thoughtless behavior of his former sons, who were but young, and were besides corrupted by wicked counselors, who were the occasion of their wiping out of their minds the righteous dictates of nature, and this out of a desire of coming to the government sooner than they ought to do; yet that he could not but justly stand amazed at the horrid wickedness of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, who, although he had not only had great benefits bestowed on him by his father, enough to tame his reason, yet could not be more tamed than the most envenomed <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>; whereas even those creatures admit of some mitigation, and will not bite their benefactors, while <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> hath not let the misfortunes of his brethren be any hinderance to him, but he hath gone on to imitate their barbarity notwithstanding. Yet wast thou, O <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>! (as thou hast thyself confessed,) the informer as to what wicked actions they had done, and the searcher out of the evidence against them, and the author of the punishment they underwent upon their detection. Nor do we say this as accusing thee for being so zealous in thy anger against them, but are astonished at thy endeavors to imitate their profligate behavior; and we discover thereby that thou didst not act thus for the safety of thy father, but for the destruction of thy brethren, that by such outside hatred of their impiety thou mightest be believed a lover of thy father, and mightest thereby get thee power enough to do mischief with the greatest impunity; which design thy actions indeed demonstrate. It is true, thou tookest thy brethren off, because thou didst convict theft of their wicked designs; but thou didst not yield up to justice those who were their partners; and thereby didst make it evident to all men that thou madest a covenant with them against thy father, when thou chosest to be the accuser of thy brethren, as desirous to gain to thyself alone this advantage of laying plots to kill thy father, and so to enjoy double pleasure, which is truly worthy of thy evil disposition, which thou has openly showed against thy brethren; on which account thou didst rejoice, as having done a most famous exploit, nor was that behavior unworthy of thee. But if thy intention were otherwise, thou art worse than they: while thou didst contrive to hide thy treachery against thy father, thou didst hate them, not as plotters against thy father, for in that case thou hadst not thyself fallen upon the like crime, but as successors of his dominions, and more worthy of that succession than thyself. Thou wouldst kill thy father after thy brethren, lest thy lies raised against them might be detected; and lest thou shouldst suffer what punishment thou hadst deserved, thou hadst a mind to exact that punishment of thy unhappy father, and didst devise such a sort of uncommon parricide as the world never yet saw. For thou who art his son didst not only lay a treacherous design against thy father, and didst it while he loved thee, and had been thy benefactor, had made thee in reality his partner in the kingdom, and had openly declared thee his successor, while thou wast not forbidden to taste the sweetness of authority already, and hadst the firm hope of what was future by thy father's determination, and the security of a written testament; but, for certain, thou didst not measure these things according to thy father's various disposition, but according to thy own thoughts and inclinations; and was desirous to take the part that remained away from thy too indulgent father, and soughtest to destroy him with thy deeds, whom thou in words pretendedst to preserve. Nor wast thou content to be wicked thyself, but thou filledst thy mother's head with thy devices, and raised disturbances among thy brethren, and hadst the boldness to call thy father a wild beast; while thou hadst thyself a mind more cruel than any <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, whence thou sentest out that poison among thy nearest kindred and greatest benefactors, and invitedst them to assist thee and guard thee, and didst hedge thyself in on all sides, by the artifices of both men and women, against an old man, as though that mind of thine was not sufficient of itself to support so great a hatred as thou baredst to him. And here thou appearest, after the tortures of free-men, of domestics, of men and women, which have been examined on thy account, and after the informations of thy fellow conspirators, as making haste to contradict the truth; and hast thought on ways not only how to take thy father out of the world, but to disannul that written law which is against thee, and the virtue of <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, and the nature of justice; nay, such is that impudence of thine on which thou confidest, that thou desirest to be put to the torture thyself, while thou allegest that the tortures of those already examined thereby have made them tell lies; that those that have been the deliverers of thy father may not be allowed to have spoken the truth; but that thy tortures may be esteemed the discoverers of truth. Wilt not thou, O <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>! deliver the king from the injuries of his kindred? Wilt not thou destroy this wicked wild beast, which hath pretended kindness to his father, in order to destroy his brethren; while yet he is himself alone ready to carry off the kingdom immediately, and appears to be the most bloody butcher to him of them all? for thou art sensible that parricide is a general injury both to nature and to common life, and that the intention of parricide is not inferior to its perpetration; and he who does not punish it is injurious to nature itself. </p>                        </div>

For those men who were not acquainted with <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s practices, but had concealed them out of fear, when they saw that he was exposed to the accusations of the former witnesses, and that his great good fortune, which had supported him hitherto, had now evidently betrayed him into the hands of his enemies, who were now insatiable in their hatred to him, told all they knew of him. And his ruin was now hastened, not so much by the enmity of those that were his accusers, as by his gross, and impudent, and wicked contrivances, and by his ill-will to his father and his brethren; while he had filled their house with disturbance, and caused them to murder one another; and was neither fair in his hatred, nor kind in his friendship, but just so far as served his own turn. Now there were a great number who for a long time beforehand had seen all this, and especially such as were naturally disposed to judge of matters by the rules of virtue, because they were used to determine about affairs without passion, but had been restrained from making any open complaints before; these, upon the leave now given them, produced all that they knew before the public. The demonstrations also of these wicked facts could no way be disproved, because the many witnesses there were did neither speak out of favor to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, nor were they obliged to keep what they had to say silent, out of suspicion of any danger they were in; but they spake what they knew, because they thought such actions very wicked, and that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> deserved the greatest punishment; and indeed not so much for <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s safety, as on account of the man's own wickedness. Many things were also said, and those by a great number of persons, who were no way obliged to say them, insomuch that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, who used generally to be very shrewd in his lies and impudence, was not able to say one word to the contrary. When <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> had left off speaking, and had produced the evidence, <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> bid <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> to betake himself to the making his defense, if he had prepared any thing whereby it might appear that he was not guilty of the crimes he was accused of; for that, as he was himself desirous, so did he know that his father was in like manner desirous also, to have him found entirely innocent. But <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> fell down on his face, and appealed to God and to all men for testimonials of his innocency, desiring that God would declare, by some evident signals, that he had not laid any plot against his father. This being the usual method of all men destitute of virtue, that when they set about any wicked undertakings, they fall to work according to their own inclinations, as if they believed that God was unconcerned in human affairs; but when once they are found out, and are in danger of undergoing the punishment due to their crimes, they endeavor to overthrow all the evidence against them by appealing to God; which was the very thing which <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> now did; for whereas he had done everything as if there were no God in the world, when he was on all sides distressed by justice, and when he had no other advantage to expect from any legal proofs, by which he might disprove the accusations laid against him, he impudently abused the majesty of God, and ascribed it to his power that he had been preserved hitherto; and produced before them all what difficulties he had ever undergone in his bold acting for his father's preservation. </p>                        </div>

Then <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> got up, and departed out of the court, and went away the day following to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, where his usual residence was, because that was the palace of the Syrians; upon which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> laid his son in bonds. But what were <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>'s discourses to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was not known to the generality, and upon what words it was that he went away; though it was also generally supposed that whatsoever <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> did afterward about his son was done with his approbation. But when <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had bound his son, he sent letters to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> about him, and such messengers withal as should, by word of mouth, inform <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>'s wickedness. Now at this very time there was seized a letter of <a href=/people/1199 target=_blank>Antiphilus</a>, written to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> (for he lived there); and when it was opened by the king, it was found to contain what follows: I have sent thee Acme's letter, and hazarded my own life; for thou knowest that I am in danger from two families, if I be discovered. I wish thee good success in thy affair. These were the contents of this letter; but the king made inquiry about the other letter also, for it did not appear; and <a href=/people/1199 target=_blank>Antiphilus</a>'s slave, who brought that letter which had been read, denied that he had received the other. But while the king was in doubt about it, one of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s friends seeing a seam upon the inner coat of the slave, and a doubling of the cloth, (for he had two coats on,) he guessed that the letter might be within that doubling; which accordingly proved to be true. So they took out the letter, and its contents were these: Acme to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>. I have written such a letter to thy father as thou desiredst me. I have also taken a copy and sent it, as if it came from <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, to my lady [<a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>]; which, when thou readest, I know that <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> Will punish <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, as plotting against him? Now this pretended letter of <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> to her lady was composed by <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, in the name of <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, as to its meaning, but in the words of Acme. The letter was this: Acme to king <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>. I have done my endeavor that nothing that is done against thee should be concealed from thee. So, upon my finding a letter of <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> written to my lady against thee, I have written out a copy, and sent it to thee; with hazard to myself, but for thy advantage. The reason why she wrote it was this, that she had a mind to be married to <a href=/people/1356 target=_blank>Sylleus</a>. Do thou therefore tear this letter in pieces, that I may not come into danger of my life. Now Acme had written to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> himself, and informed him, that, in compliance with his command, she had both herself written to <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, as if <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> had laid a sudden plot entirely against him, and had herself sent a copy of an letter, as coming from <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a> to her lady. Now Acme was a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> by birth, and a servant to <a href=/people/511 target=_blank>Julia</a>, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wife; and did this out of her friendship for <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, as having been corrupted by him with a large present of money, to assist in his pernicious designs against his father and his aunt. </p>                        </div>

These men, when they found that the king's distemper was incurable, excited the young men that they would pull down all those works which the king had erected contrary to the law of their fathers, and thereby obtain the rewards which the law will confer on them for such actions of piety; for that it was truly on account of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s rashness in making such things as the law had forbidden, that his other misfortunes, and this distemper also, which was so unusual among mankind, and with which he was now afflicted, came upon him; for <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had caused such things to be made which were contrary to the law, of which he was accused by <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> and <a href=/people/1950 target=_blank>Matthias</a>; for the king had erected over the great gate of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> a large golden <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, of great value, and had dedicated it to the temple. Now the law forbids those that propose to live according to it, to erect images or representations of any living creature. So these wise men persuaded [their scholars] to pull down the golden <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>; alleging, that although they should incur any danger, which might bring them to their deaths, the virtue of the action now proposed to them would appear much more advantageous to them than the pleasures of life; since they would die for the preservation and observation of the law of their fathers; since they would also acquire an everlasting fame and commendation; since they would be both commended by the present generation, and leave an example of life that would never be forgotten to posterity; since that common calamity of dying cannot be avoided by our living so as to escape any such dangers; that therefore it is a right thing for those who are in love with a virtuous conduct, to wait for that fatal hour by such behavior as may carry them out of the world with praise and honor; and that this will alleviate death to a great degree, thus to come at it by the performance of brave actions, which bring us into danger of it; and at the same time to leave that reputation behind them to their children, and to all their relations, whether they be men or women, which will be of great advantage to them afterward. </p>                        </div>

And now the king's captain, upon hearing what the undertaking was, and supposing it was a thing of a higher nature than it proved to be, came up thither, having a great band of soldiers with him, such as was sufficient to put a stop to the multitude of those who pulled down what was dedicated to God; so he fell upon them unexpectedly, and as they were upon this bold attempt, in a foolish presumption rather than a cautious circumspection, as is usual with the multitude, and while they were in disorder, and incautious of what was for their advantage; so he caught no fewer than forty of the young men, who had the courage to stay behind when the rest ran away, together with the authors of this bold attempt, <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> and Matthius, who thought it an ignominious thing to retire upon his approach, and led them to the king. And when they were come to the king, and he asked them if they had been so bold as to pull down what he had dedicated to God, Yes, (said they,) what was contrived we contrived, and what hath been performed we performed it, and that with such a virtuous courage as becomes men; for we have given our assistance to those things which were dedicated to the majesty of God, and we have provided for what we have learned by hearing the law; and it ought not to be wondered at, if we esteem those laws which <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> had suggested to him, and were taught him by God, and which he wrote and left behind him, more worthy of observation than thy commands. Accordingly we will undergo death, and all sorts of punishments which thou canst inflict upon us, with pleasure, since we are conscious to ourselves that we shall die, not for any unrighteous actions, but for our love to religion. And thus they all said, and their courage was still equal to their profession, and equal to that with which they readily set about this undertaking.

He then cried out, that these men had not abstained from affronting him, even in his lifetime, but that in the very day time, and in the sight of the multitude, they had abused him to that degree, as to fall upon what he had dedicated, and in that way of abuse had pulled it down to the ground. They pretended, indeed, that they did it to affront him; but if any one consider the thing truly, they will find that they were guilty of sacrilege against God therein. </p>                        </div>

His entrails were also ex-ulcerated, and the chief violence of his pain lay on his colon; an aqueous and transparent liquor also had settled itself about his feet, and a like matter afflicted him at the bottom of his belly.

It was said by those who pretended to divine, and who were endued with wisdom to foretell such things, that God inflicted this punishment on the king on account of his great impiety; yet was he still in hopes of recovering, though his afflictions seemed greater than any one could bear.

He commanded that all the principal men of the entire <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation, wheresoever they lived, should be called to him. Accordingly, they were a great number that came, because the whole nation was called, and all men heard of this call, and death was the penalty of such as should despise the letters that were sent to call them. And now the king was in a wild rage against them all, the innocent as well as those that had afforded ground for accusations; and when they were come, he ordered them to be all shut up in the hyppodrome, and sent for his sister <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, and her husband <a href=/people/3329 target=_blank>Alexas</a>, and spake thus to them: I shall die in a little time, so great are my pains; which death ought to be cheerfully borne, and to be welcomed by all men; but what principally troubles me is this, that I shall die without being lamented, and without such mourning as men usually expect at a king's death. For that he was not unacquainted with the temper of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, that his death would be a thing very desirable, and exceedingly acceptable to them, because during his lifetime they were ready to revolt from him, and to abuse the donations he had dedicated to God that it therefore was their business to resolve to afford him some alleviation of his great sorrows on this occasion; for that if they do not refuse him their consent in what he desires, he shall have a great mourning at his funeral, and such as never had any king before him; for then the whole nation would mourn from their very soul, which otherwise would be done in sport and mockery only. He desired therefore, that as soon as they see he hath given up the ghost, they shall place soldiers round the hippodrome, while they do not know that he is dead; and that they shall not declare his death to the multitude till this is done, but that they shall give orders to have those that are in custody shot with their darts; and that this slaughter of them all will cause that he shall not miss to rejoice on a double account; that as he is dying, they will make him secure that his will shall be executed in what he charges them to do; and that he shall have the honor of a memorable mourning at his funeral. So he deplored his condition, with tears in his eyes, and obtested them by the kindness due from them, as of his kindred, and by the faith they owed to God, and begged of them that they would not hinder him of this honorable mourning at his funeral. So they promised him not to transgress his commands. </p>                        </div>

And as <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> was afraid lest some terrible thing should spring up by means of these men's madness, he sent a regiment of armed men, and with them a captain of a thousand, to suppress the violent efforts of the seditious before the whole multitude should be infected with the like madness; and gave them this charge, that if they found any much more openly seditious than others, and more busy in tumultuous practices, they should bring them to him. But those that were seditious on account of those teachers of the law, irritated the people by the noise and clamors they used to encourage the people in their designs; so they made an assault upon the soldiers, and came up to them, and stoned the greatest part of them, although some of them ran away wounded, and their captain among them; and when they had thus done, they returned to the sacrifices which were already in their hands. Now <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> thought there was no way to preserve the entire government but by cutting off those who made this attempt upon it; so he sent out the whole army upon them, and sent the horsemen to prevent those that had their tents without the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> from assisting those that were within the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and to kill such as ran away from the footmen when they thought themselves out of danger; which horsemen slew three thousand men, while the rest went to the neighboring mountains. Then did <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> order proclamation to be made to them all, that they should retire to their own homes; so they went away, and left the festival, out of fear of somewhat worse which would follow, although they had been so bold by reason of their want of instruction. So <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> went down to the sea with his mother, and took with him <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> and <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and many others of his friends, and left <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> his brother as governor of all things belonging both to his own family and to the public. There went out also with him <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s sister who took with her, her children, and many of her kindred were with her; which kindred of hers went, as they pretended, to assist <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> in gaining the kingdom, but in reality to oppose him, and chiefly to make loud complaints of what he had done in the temple. But <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s steward for Syrian affairs, as he was making haste into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> to preserve <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s effects, met with <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>; but <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a> (president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>) came at that time, and restrained him from meddling with them, for he was there as sent for by Archceaus, by the means of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>. And <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, out of regard to <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, did neither seize upon any of the castles that were among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, nor did he seal up the treasures in them, but permitted <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> to have them, until <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should declare his resolution about them; so that, upon this his promise, he tarried still at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>.

He also sent for the keepers of the garrisons, and for all those that had the charge of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s effects, and declared publicly that he should require them to give an account of what they had; and he disposed of the castles in the manner he pleased; but those who kept them did not neglect what <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> had given them in command, but continued to keep all things in the manner that had been enjoined them; and their pretense was, that they kept them all for <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, <a href=/people/899 target=_blank>Salome</a>'s son, a very subtle orator, and a bitter enemy to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, spake first to this purpose: That it was ridiculous in <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> to plead now to have the kingdom given him, since he had, in reality, taken already the power over it to himself, before <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had granted it to him; and appealed to those bold actions of his, in destroying so many at the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> festival; and if the men had acted unjustly, it was but fit the punishing of them should have been reserved to those that were out of the country, but had the power to punish them, and not been executed by a man that, if he pretended to be a king, he did an injury to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, by usurping that authority before it was determined for him by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; but if he owned himself to be a private person, his case was much worse, since he who was putting in for the kingdom could by no means expect to have that power granted him, of which he had already deprived <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> [by taking it to himself]. He also touched sharply upon him, and appealed to his changing the commanders in the army, and his sitting in the royal throne beforehand, and his determination of law-suits; all done as if he were no other than a king. He appealed also to his concessions to those that petitioned him on a public account, and indeed doing such things, than which he could devise no greater if he had been already settled in the kingdom by <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. He also ascribed to him the releasing of the prisoners that were in the hippodrome, and many other things, that either had been certainly done by him, or were believed to be done, and easily might be believed to have been done, because they were of such a nature as to be usually done by young men, and by such as, out of a desire of ruling, seize upon the government too soon. He also charged him with his neglect of the funeral mourning for his father, and with having merry meetings the very night in which he died; and that it was thence the multitude took the handle of raising a tumult: and if <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> could thus requite his dead father, who had bestowed such benefits upon him, and bequeathed such great things to him, by pretending to shed tears for him in the day time, like an actor on the stage, but every night making mirth for having gotten the government, he would appear to be the same <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> with regard to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, if he granted him the kingdom, which he hath been to his father; since he had then dancing and singing, as though an enemy of his were fallen, and not as though a man were carried to his funeral, that was so nearly related, and had been so great a benefactor to him. But he said that the greatest crime of all was this, that he came now before <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to obtain the government by his grant, while he had before acted in all things as he could have acted if <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself, who ruled all, had fixed him firmly in the government. And what he most aggravated in his pleading was the slaughter of those about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and the impiety of it, as done at the festival; and how they were slain like sacrifices themselves, some of whom were foreigners, and others of their own country, till the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was full of dead bodies: and all this was done, not by an alien, but by one who pretended to the lawful title of a king, that he might complete the wicked tyranny which his nature prompted him to, and which is hated by all men. On which account his father never so much as dreamed of making him his successor in the kingdom, when he was of a sound mind, because he knew his disposition; and in his former and more authentic testament, he appointed his antagonist <a href=/people/2712 target=_blank>Antipas</a> to succeed; but that <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> was called by his father to that dignity when he was in a dying condition, both of body and mind; while <a href=/people/2712 target=_blank>Antipas</a> was called when he was ripest in his judgment, and of such strength of body as made him capable of managing his own affairs: and if his father had the like notion of him formerly that he hath now showed, yet hath he given a sufficient specimen what a king he is likely to be, when he hath [in effect] deprived <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of that power of disposing of the kingdom, which he justly hath, and hath not abstained from making a terrible slaughter of his fellow citizens in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, while he was but a private person. </p>                        </div>

Upon which <a href=/people/842 target=_blank>Nicolaus</a> arose up to plead for <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, and said, That what had been done at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was rather to be attributed to the mind of those that had been killed, than to the authority of <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>; for that those who were the authors of such things are not only wicked in the injuries they do of themselves, but in forcing sober persons to avenge themselves upon them. Now it is evident that what these did in way of opposition was done under pretense, indeed, against <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, but in reality against <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself, for they, after an injurious manner, attacked and slew those who were sent by <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, and who came only to put a stop to their doings. They had no regard, either to God or to the festival, whom <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> yet is not ashamed to patronize, whether it be out of his indulgence of an enmity to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, or out of his hatred of virtue and justice. For as to those who begin such tumults, and first set about such unrighteous actions, they are the men who force those that punish them to betake themselves to arms even against their will. So that <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> in effect ascribes the rest of what was done to all those who were of counsel to the accusers; for nothing which is here accused of injustice has been done but what was derived from them as its authors; nor are those things evil in themselves, but so represented only in order to do harm to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>. Such is these men's inclination to do an injury to a man that is of their kindred, their father's benefactor, and familiarity acquainted with them, and that hath ever lived in friendship with them; for that, as to this testament, it was made by the king when he was of a sound mind, and so ought to be of more authority than his former testament; and that for this reason, because <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is therein left to be the judge and disposer of all therein contained; and for <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he will not, to be sure, at all imitate the unjust proceedings of those men, who, during <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s whole life, had on all occasions been joint partakers of power with him, and yet do zealously endeavor to injure his determination, while they have not themselves had the same regard to their kinsman [which <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> had]. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will not therefore disannul the testament of a man whom he had entirely supported, of his friend and confederate, and that which is committed to him in trust to ratify; nor will <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s virtuous and upright disposition, which is known and uncontested through all the habitable world, imitate the wickedness of these men in condemning a king as a madman, and as having lost his reason, while he hath bequeathed the succession to a good son of his, and to one who flies to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s upright determination for refuge. Nor can <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> at any time have been mistaken in his judgment about a successor, while he showed so much prudence as to submit all to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s determination. </p>                        </div>

However, while he gave this encouragement to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> to depend on him securely, he made no full determination about him; and when the assembly was broken up, he considered by himself whether he should confirm the kingdom to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, or whether he should part it among all <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s posterity; and this because they all stood in need of much assistance to support them. </p>                        </div>

A great number there was of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=ethnic long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galileans</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=ethnic long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumeans</a>, and many men from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a>, and others who had passed over the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a>, and inhabited those parts. This whole multitude joined themselves to all the rest, and were more zealous than the others in making an assault on <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, in order to be avenged on him; so they parted themselves into three bands, and encamped themselves in the places following: — some of them seized on the hippodrome and of the other two bands, one pitched themselves from the northern part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> to the southern, on the east quarter; but the third band held the western part of the city, where the king's palace was. Their work tended entirely to besiege the Romans, and to enclose them on all sides. Now <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> was afraid of these men's number, and of their resolution, who had little regard to their lives, but were very desirous not to be overcome, while they thought it a point of puissance to overcome their enemies; so he sent immediately a letter to <a href=/people/12144 target=_blank>Varus</a>, and, as he used to do, was very pressing with him, and entreated him to come quickly to his assistance, because the forces he had left were in imminent danger, and would probably, in no long time, be seized upon, and cut to pieces; while he did himself get up to the highest tower of the fortress <a href=/people/1335 target=_blank>Phasaelus</a>, which had been built in honor of <a href=/people/1335 target=_blank>Phasaelus</a>, king <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s brother, and called so when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> had brought him to his death. So <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> gave thence a signal to the Romans to fall upon the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, although he did not himself venture so much as to come down to his friends, and thought he might expect that the others should expose themselves first to die on account of his avarice. However, the Romans ventured to make a sally out of the place, and a terrible battle ensued; wherein, though it is true the Romans beat their adversaries, yet were not the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> daunted in their resolutions, even when they had the sight of that terrible slaughter that was made of them; but they went round about, and got upon those cloisters which encompassed the outer court of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, where a great fight was still continued, and they cast stones at the Romans, partly with their hands, and partly with slings, as being much used to those exercises. All the archers also in array did the Romans a great deal of mischief, because they used their hands dexterously from a place superior to the others, and because the others were at an utter loss what to do; for when they tried to shoot their arrows against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> upwards, these arrows could not reach them, insomuch that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were easily too hard for their enemies. And this sort of fight lasted a great while, till at last the Romans, who were greatly distressed by what was done, set fire to the cloisters so privately, that those that were gotten upon them did not perceive it. This fire being fed by a great deal of combustible matter, caught hold immediately on the roof of the cloisters; so the wood, which was full of pitch and wax, and whose gold was laid on it with wax, yielded to the flame presently, and those vast works, which were of the highest value and esteem, were destroyed utterly, while those that were on the roof unexpectedly perished at the same time; for as the roof tumbled down, some of these men tumbled down with it, and others of them were killed by their enemies who encompassed them. There was a great number more, who, out of despair of saving their lives, and out of astonishment at the misery that surrounded them, did either cast themselves into the fire, or threw themselves upon their swords, and so got out of their misery. But as to those that retired behind the same way by which they ascended, and thereby escaped, they were all killed by the Romans, as being unarmed men, and their courage failing them; their wild fury being now not able to help them, because they were destitute of armor, insomuch that of those that went up to the top of the roof, not one escaped. The Romans also rushed through the fire, where it gave them room so to do, and seized on that treasure where the sacred money was reposited; a great part of which was stolen by the soldiers, and <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> got openly four hundred talents. </p>                        </div>

This man was elevated at the disorderly state of things, and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head, while a certain number of the people stood by him, and by them he was declared to be a king, and thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else. He burnt down the royal palace at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318354UHie class=place long=35.4438 lat=31.87>Jericho</a>, and plundered what was left in it. He also set fire to many other of the king's houses in several places of the country, and utterly destroyed them, and permitted those that were with him to take what was left in them for a prey; and he would have done greater things, unless care had been taken to repress him immediately; for <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a>, when he had joined himself to some Roman soldiers, took the forces he had with him, and met <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a>, and after a great and a long fight, no small part of those that came from Peraea, who were a disordered body of men, and fought rather in a bold than in a skillful manner, were destroyed; and although <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> had saved himself by flying away through a certain valley, yet <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a> overtook him, and cut off his head.

This man thought it so sweet a thing to do more than ordinary injuries to others, that although he should be killed, he did not much care if he lost his life in so great a design. He had also four brethren, who were tall men themselves, and were believed to be superior to others in the strength of their hands, and thereby were encouraged to aim at great things, and thought that strength of theirs would support them in retaining the kingdom. Each of these ruled over a band of men of their own; for those that got together to them were very numerous. They were every one of them also commanders; but when they came to fight, they were subordinate to him, and fought for him, while he put a diadem about his head, and assembled a council to debate about what things should be done, and all things were done according to his pleasure. And this man retained his power a great while; he was also called king, and had nothing to hinder him from doing what he pleased. He also, as well as his brethren, slew a great many both of the Romans and of the king's forces, an managed matters with the like hatred to each of them. The king's forces they fell upon, because of the licentious conduct they had been allowed under <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s government; and they fell upon the Romans, because of the injuries they had so lately received from them. But in process of time they grew more cruel to all sorts of men, nor could any one escape from one or other of these seditions, since they slew some out of the hopes of gain, and others from a mere custom of slaying men. They once attacked a company of Romans at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318349UNik class=place long=34.9894 lat=31.8392>Emmaus</a>, who were bringing corn and weapons to the army, and fell upon <a href=/people/1934 target=_blank>Arius</a>, the centurion, who commanded the company, and shot forty of the best of his foot soldiers; but the rest of them were affrighted at their slaughter, and left their dead behind them, but saved themselves by the means of <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a>, who came with the king's troops that were about him to their assistance. Now these four brethren continued the war a long while by such sort of expeditions, and much grieved the Romans; but did their own nation also a great deal of mischief. Yet were they afterwards subdued; one of them in a fight with <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a>, another with <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>; <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> also took the eldest of them prisoner; while the last of them was so dejected at the other's misfortune, and saw so plainly that he had no way now left to save himself, his army being worn away with sickness and continual labors, that he also delivered himself up to <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a>, upon his promise and oath to God [to preserve his life.] But these things came to pass a good while afterward. </p>                        </div>

That he did never leave off adorning these cities that lay in their neighborhood, but were inhabited by foreigners; but so that the cities belonging to his own government were ruined, and utterly destroyed that whereas, when he took the kingdom, it was in an extraordinary flourishing condition, he had filled the nation with the utmost degree of poverty; and when, upon unjust pretenses, he had slain any of the nobility, he took away their estates; and when he permitted any of them to live, he condemned them to the forfeiture of what they possessed. And besides the annual impositions which he laid upon every one of them, they were to make liberal presents to himself, to his domestics and friends, and to such of his slaves as were vouchsafed the favor of being his tax-gatherers, because there was no way of obtaining a freedom from unjust violence without giving either gold or silver for it. That they would say nothing of the corruption of the chastity of their virgins, and the reproach laid on their wives for incontinency, and those things acted after an insolent and inhuman manner; because it was not a smaller pleasure to the sufferers to have such things concealed, than it would have been not to have suffered them. That <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had put such abuses upon them as a wild beast would not have put on them, if he had power given him to rule over us; and that although their nation had passed through many subversions and alterations of government, their history gave no account of any calamity they had ever been under, that could be compared with this which <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had brought upon their nation; that it was for this reason that they thought they might justly and gladly salute <a href=/people/113 target=_blank>Archelaus</a> as king, upon this supposition, that whosoever should be set over their kingdom, he would appear more mild to them than <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> had been; and that they had joined with him in the mourning for his father, in order to gratify him, and were ready to oblige him in other points also, if they could meet with any degree of moderation from him; but that he seemed to be afraid lest he should not be deemed <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s own son; and so, without any delay, he immediately let the nation understand his meaning, and this before his dominion was well established, since the power of disposing of it belonged to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who could either give it to him or not, as he pleased. That he had given a specimen of his future virtue to his subjects, and with what kind of moderation and good administration he would govern them, by that his first action, which concerned them, his own citizens, and God himself also, when he made the slaughter of three thousand of his own countrymen at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. How then could they avoid the just hatred of him, who, to the rest of his barbarity, hath added this as one of our crimes, that we have opposed and contradicted him in the exercise of his authority? Now the main thing they desired was this: That they might be delivered from kingly and the like forms of government, and might be added to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and be put under the authority of such presidents of theirs as should be sent to them; for that it would thereby be made evident, whether they be really a seditious people, and generally fond of innovations, or whether they would live in an orderly manner, if they might have governors of any sort of moderation set over them. </p>                        </div>

And when he was come, he was carried in a royal litter through the streets; and all the ornaments about him were such as kings are adorned withal; and this was at the expense of those that entertained him.

When, therefore, <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> saw how the master and the scholar agreed in this lying story, and in a bold way of talking, he inquired about <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, and asked what became of him who (it seems) was stolen away together with him, and for what reason it was that he did not come along with him, and endeavor to recover that dominion which was due to his high birth also.

For this contrivance is too considerable a piece of villainy to be undertaken by one of thy age. Accordingly, because he had no other way to take, he told <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> the contrivance, and after what manner and by whom it was laid together. So <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, upon observing the spurious <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> to be a strong active man, and fit to work with his hands, that he might not break his promise to him, put him among those that were to row among the mariners, but slew him that induced him to do what he had done; for as for the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367244PMel class=place long=24.4199 lat=36.7389>Melos</a>, he thought them sufficiently punished, in having thrown away so much of their money upon this spurious <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.

This was done in pretense indeed for the public welfare, but in reality for the hopes of gain to themselves; whence arose seditions, and from them murders of men, which sometimes fell on those of their own people, (by the madness of these men towards one another, while their desire was that none of the adverse party might be left,) and sometimes on their enemies; a famine also coming upon us, reduced us to the last degree of despair, as did also the taking and demolishing of cities; nay, the sedition at last increased so high, that the very <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of God was burnt down by their enemies' fire. Such were the consequences of this, that the customs of our fathers were altered, and such a change was made, as added a mighty weight toward bringing all to destruction, which these men occasioned by their thus conspiring together; for <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a> and Sadduc, who excited a fourth philosophic sect among us, and had a great many followers therein, filled our civil government with tumults at present, and laid the foundations of our future miseries, by this system of philosophy, which we were before unacquainted withal, concerning which I will discourse a little, and this the rather because the infection which spread thence among the younger sort, who were zealous for it, brought the public to destruction. </p>                        </div>

This is demonstrated by that institution of theirs, which will not suffer any thing to hinder them from having all things in common; so that a rich man enjoys no more of his own wealth than he who hath nothing at all. There are about four thousand men that live in this way, and neither marry wives, nor are desirous to keep servants; as thinking the latter tempts men to be unjust, and the former gives the handle to domestic quarrels; but as they live by themselves, they minister one to another.

Now she was able to persuade him to do any thing that she said, and was earnest in procuring the government of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> for her son; but still she saw that her endeavors would not succeed, unless she could contrive how to remove <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a>'s legitimate sons [out of the kingdom;] so she persuaded him to send those his sons as pledges of his fidelity to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and they were sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> accordingly, because it was not easy for him to contradict her commands. Now while <a href=/people/8167 target=_blank>Phraataces</a> was alone brought up in order to succeed in the government, he thought it very tedious to expect that government by his father's donation [as his successor]; he therefore formed a treacherous design against his father, by his mother's assistance, with whom, as the report went, he had criminal conversation also. So he was hated for both these vices, while his subjects esteemed this [wicked] love of his mother to be no way inferior to his parricide; and he was by them, in a sedition, expelled out of the country before he grew too great, and died. But as the best sort of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> agreed together that it was impossible they should be governed without a king, while also it was their constant practice to choose one of the family of <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>, [nor did their law allow of any others; and they thought this kingdom had been sufficiently injured already by the marriage with an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> concubine, and by her issue,] they sent ambassadors, and called <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a> [to take the crown]; for the multitude would not otherwise have borne them; and though he was accused of very great cruelty, and was of an untractable temper, and prone to wrath, yet still he was one of the family of <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>. However, they made a conspiracy against him, and slew him, and that, as some say, at a festival, and among their sacrifices; (for it is the universal custom there to carry their swords with them;) but, as the more general report is, they slew him when they had drawn him out a hunting. So they sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and desired they would send one of those that were there as pledges to be their king. Accordingly, <a href=/people/12014 target=_blank>Vonones</a> was preferred before the rest, and sent to them (for he seemed capable of such great fortune, which two of the greatest kingdoms under the sun now offered him, his own and a foreign one). However, the barbarians soon changed their minds, they being naturally of a mutable disposition, upon the supposal that this man was not worthy to be their governor; for they could not think of obeying the commands of one that had been a slave, (for so they called those that had been hostages,) nor could they bear the ignominy of that name; and this was the more intolerable, because then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> must have such a king set over them, not by right of war, but in time of peace. So they presently invited <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, to be their king, he being also of the race of <a href=/people/565 target=_blank>Arsaces</a>. <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> complied with the offer that was made him, and came to them with an army. So <a href=/people/12014 target=_blank>Vonones</a> met him; and at first the multitude of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> stood on this side, and he put his army in array; but <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> was beaten, and fled to the mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>. Yet did he a little after gather a great army together, and fought with <a href=/people/12014 target=_blank>Vonones</a>, and beat him; whereupon <a href=/people/12014 target=_blank>Vonones</a> fled away on horseback, with a few of his attendants about him, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364339PSel class=place long=33.9165 lat=36.3765>Seleucia</a> [upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a>]. So when <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> had slain a great number, and this after he had gotten the victory by reason of the very great dismay the barbarians were in, he retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/331446UKte class=place long=44.5807 lat=33.0937>Ctesiphon</a> with a great number of his people; and so he now reigned over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. But <a href=/people/12014 target=_blank>Vonones</a> fled away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>; and as soon as he came thither, he had an inclination to have the government of the country given him, and sent ambassadors to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> [for that purpose]. But because <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> refused it him, and because he wanted courage, and because the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> king threatened him, and sent ambassadors to him to denounce war against him if he proceeded, and because he had no way to take to regain any other kingdom, (for the people of authority among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a> about <a href=/people/2431 target=_blank>Niphates</a> joined themselves to <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a>,) he delivered up himself to <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a>, the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, who, out of regard to his education at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, kept him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, while <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> gave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a> to <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a>, one of his own sons. </p>                        </div>

There was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> a woman whose name was <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>; one who, on account of the dignity of her ancestors, and by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a great reputation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a beautiful countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay, yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>, one that was every way answerable to her in an excellent character. <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a> <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> fell in love with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian order; and as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance, he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised to give her two hundred thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> drachmae for one night's lodging; and when this would not prevail upon her, and he was not able to bear this misfortune in his amours, he thought it the best way to famish himself to death for want of food, on account of <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>'s sad refusal; and he determined with himself to die after such a manner, and he went on with his purpose accordingly. Now <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> had a freed-woman, who had been made free by his father, whose name was <a href=/people/4039 target=_blank>Ide</a>, one skillful in all sorts of mischief. This woman was very much grieved at the young man's resolution to kill himself, (for he did not conceal his intentions to destroy himself from others,) and came to him, and encouraged him by her discourse, and made him to hope, by some promises she gave him, that he might obtain a night's lodging with <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>; and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty, she said she wanted no more than fifty thousand drachmae for the entrapping of the woman. So when she had encouraged the young man, and gotten as much money as she required, she did not take the same methods as had been taken before, because she perceived that the woman was by no means to be tempted by money; but as she knew that she was very much given to the worship of the goddess <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, she devised the following stratagem: She went to some of <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>'s priests, and upon the strongest assurances [of concealment], she persuaded them by words, but chiefly by the offer of money, of twenty-five thousand drachmae in hand, and as much more when the thing had taken effect; and told them the passion of the young man, and persuaded them to use all means possible to beguile the woman. So they were drawn in to promise so to do, by that large sum of gold they were to have. Accordingly, the oldest of them went immediately to <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>; and upon his admittance, he desired to speak with her by herself. When that was granted him, he told her that he was sent by the god <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>, who was fallen in love with her, and enjoined her to come to him. Upon this she took the message very kindly, and valued herself greatly upon this condescension of <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>, and told her husband that she had a message sent her, and was to sup and lie with <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>; so he agreed to her acceptance of the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity of his wife. Accordingly, she went to the temple, and after she had supped there, and it was the hour to go to sleep, the priest shut the doors of the temple, when, in the holy part of it, the lights were also put out. Then did <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> leap out, (for he was hidden therein,) and did not fail of enjoying her, who was at his service all the night long, as supposing he was the god; and when he was gone away, which was before those priests who knew nothing of this stratagem were stirring, <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a> came early to her husband, and told him how the god <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a> had appeared to her. Among her friends, also, she declared how great a value she put upon this favor, who partly disbelieved the thing, when they reflected on its nature, and partly were amazed at it, as having no pretense for not believing it, when they considered the modesty and the dignity of the person. But now, on the third day after what had been done, <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> met <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>, and said, Nay, <a href=/people/2910 target=_blank>Paulina</a>, thou hast saved me two hundred thousand drachmae, which sum thou sightest have added to thy own family; yet hast thou not failed to be at my service in the manner I invited thee. As for the reproaches thou hast laid upon <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a>, I value not the business of names; but I rejoice in the pleasure I reaped by what I did, while I took to myself the name of <a href=/people/1656 target=_blank>Anubis</a>. When he had said this, he went his way. But now she began to come to the sense of the grossness of what she had done, and rent her garments, and told her husband of the horrid nature of this wicked contrivance, and prayed him not to neglect to assist her in this case. So he discovered the fact to the emperor; whereupon <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the priests about it, and ordered them to be crucified, as well as <a href=/people/4039 target=_blank>Ide</a>, who was the occasion of their perdition, and who had contrived the whole matter, which was so injurious to the woman.

However, he fell in love with <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a>, this last <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s wife, who was the daughter of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> their brother, and the sister of <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> the Great. This man ventured to talk to her about a marriage between them; which address, when she admitted, an agreement was made for her to change her habitation, and come to him as soon as he should return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: one article of this marriage also was this, that he should divorce <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>'s daughter. So Antipus, when he had made this agreement, sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; but when he had done there the business he went about, and was returned again, his wife having discovered the agreement he had made with <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a>, and having learned it before he had notice of her knowledge of the whole design, she desired him to send her to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315356UMac class=place long=35.6241 lat=31.5673>Macherus</a>, which is a place in the borders of the dominions of <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a> and <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, without informing him of any of her intentions. Accordingly <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> sent her thither, as thinking his wife had not perceived any thing; now she had sent a good while before to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315356UMac class=place long=35.6241 lat=31.5673>Macherus</a>, which was subject to her father and so all things necessary for her journey were made ready for her by the general of <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>'s army; and by that means she soon came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, under the conduct of the several generals, who carried her from one to another successively; and she soon came to her father, and told him of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s intentions. So <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a> made this the first occasion of his enmity between him and <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who had also some quarrel with him about their limits at the country of Gamalitis. So they raised armies on both sides, and prepared for war, and sent their generals to fight instead of themselves; and when they had joined battle, all <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s army was destroyed by the treachery of some fugitives, who, though they were of the tetrarchy of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, joined with <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>'s army.. So <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> wrote about these affairs to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, who being very angry at the attempt made by <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a>, wrote to <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> to make war upon him, and either to take him alive, and bring him to him in bonds, or to kill him, and send him his head. This was the charge that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> gave to the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s suspicious temper, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315356UMac class=place long=35.6241 lat=31.5673>Macherus</a>, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.

But as he was marching very busily, and leading his army through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, the principal men met him, and desired that he would not thus march through their land; for that the laws of their country would not permit them to overlook those images which were brought into it, of which there were a great many in their ensigns; so he was persuaded by what they said, and changed that resolution of his which he had before taken in this matter. Whereupon he ordered the army to march along the great plain, while he himself, with <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> the tetrarch and his friends, went up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> to offer sacrifice to God, an ancient festival of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> being then just approaching; and when he had been there, and been honorably entertained by the multitude of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, he made a stay there for three days, within which time he deprived <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> of the high priesthood, and gave it to his brother <a href=/people/1209 target=_blank>Theophilus</a>. But when on the fourth day letters came to him, which informed him of the death of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, he obliged the multitude to take an oath of fidelity to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; he also recalled his army, and made them every one go home, and take their winter quarters there, since, upon the devolution of the empire upon <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, he had not the like authority of making this war which he had before. It was also reported, that when <a href=/people/1421 target=_blank>Aretas</a> heard of the coming of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> to fight him, he said, upon his consulting the diviners, that it was impossible that this army of <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>'s could enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/303254UPet class=place long=35.4423 lat=30.3285>Petra</a>; for that one of the rulers would die, either he that gave orders for the war, or he that was marching at the other's desire, in order to be subservient to his will, or else he against whom this army is prepared. So <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a> truly retired to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>; but <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, the son of <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a>, went up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, a year before the death of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, in order to treat of some affairs with the emperor, if he might be permitted so to do. I have now a mind to describe <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> and his family, how it fared with them, partly because it is suitable to this history to speak of that matter, and partly because this thing is a demonstration of the interposition of Providence, how a multitude of children is of no advantage, no more than any other strength that mankind set their hearts upon, besides those acts of piety which are done towards God; for it happened, that, within the revolution of a hundred years, the posterity of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, which were a great many in number, were, excepting a few, utterly destroyed. One may well apply this for the instruction of mankind, and learn thence how unhappy they were: it will also show us the history of <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who, as he was a person most worthy of admiration, so was he from a private man, beyond all the expectation of those that knew him, advanced to great power and authority. I have said something of them formerly, but I shall now also speak accurately about them. </p>                        </div>

Whereupon he knew not what to do; so, for shame of his present condition, he retired to a certain tower, at Malatha, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a>, and had thoughts of killing himself; but his wife Cypros perceived his intentions, and tried all sorts of methods to divert him from his taking such a course; so she sent a letter to his sister <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a>, who was now the wife of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> the tetrarch, and let her know <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s present design, and what necessity it was which drove him thereto, and desired her, as a kinswoman of his, to give him her help, and to engage her husband to do the same, since she saw how she alleviated these her husband's troubles all she could, although she had not the like wealth to do it withal. So they sent for him, and allotted him <a about=https://topostext.org/place/327355UTib class=place long=35.5438 lat=32.7743>Tiberias</a> for his habitation, and appointed him some income of money for his maintenance, and made him a magistrate of that city, by way of honor to him. Yet did not <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> long continue in that resolution of supporting him, though even that support was not sufficient for him; for as once they were at a feast at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, and in their cups, and reproaches were cast upon one another, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> thought that was not to be borne, while <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> hit him in the teeth with his poverty, and with his owing his necessary food to him.

However, <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> did not abate of his ill-will to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, till at length he brought him into ill terms with <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>; the occasion of bringing on which estrangement was this: The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=ethnic long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascenes</a> were at difference with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=ethnic long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidonians</a> about their limits, and when <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> was about to hear the cause between them, they understood that <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had a mighty influence upon him; so they desired that he would be of their side, and for that favor promised him a great deal of money; so he was zealous in assisting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=ethnic long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascenes</a> as far as he was able. Now <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> had gotten intelligence of this promise of money to him, and accused him to <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> of the same; and when, upon a thorough examination of the matter, it appeared plainly so to be, he rejected <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> out of the number of his friends. So he was reduced to the utmost necessity, and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/329351UPto class=place long=35.0817 lat=32.9278>Ptolemais</a>; and because he knew not where else to get a livelihood, he thought to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; but as he was restrained from so doing by want of money, he desired <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, who was his freed-man, to find some method for procuring him so much as he wanted for that purpose, by borrowing such a sum of some person or other. So <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> desired of Peter, who was the freed-man of <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a>, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s mother, and by the right of her testament was bequeathed to <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, to lend so much upon <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s own bond and security; but he accused <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> of having defrauded him of certain sums of money, and so obliged <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, when he made the bond of twenty thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> drachmae, to accept of twenty-five hundred drachma as less than what he desired, which the other allowed of, because he could not help it.

Accordingly, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> paid them five talents at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and promised to pay them the rest of that sum at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Dicearchia</a>; and this he did out of the fear he was in that <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> would soon spend it.

When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had read this letter, he was much troubled at it, and gave order that <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> should be excluded from his presence until he had paid that debt: upon which he was no way daunted at <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s anger, but entreated <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, the mother of <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, and of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who was afterward Caesar himself, to lend him those three hundred thousand drachmae, that he might not be deprived of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s friendship; so, out of regard to the memory of <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a> his mother, (for those two women were very familiar with one another,) and out of regard to his and <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>'s education together, she lent him the money; and, upon the payment of this debt, there was nothing to hinder <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s friendship to him. After this, <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius Caesar</a> recommended to him his grandson, and ordered that he should always accompany him when he went abroad.

Now <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a>, who was <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s freed-man, and drove his chariot, heard these words, and at that time said nothing of them; but when <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> accused him of stealing some garments of his, (which was certainly true,) he ran away from him; but when he was caught, and brought before <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, who was governor of the city, and the man was asked why he ran away, be replied, that he had somewhat to say to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that tended to his security and preservation: so <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> bound him, and sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406143ICap class=place long=14.2623 lat=40.5579>Capreae</a>. But <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, according to his usual custom, kept him still in bonds, being a delayer of affairs, if ever there was any other king or tyrant that was so; for he did not admit ambassadors quickly, and no successors were despatched away to governors or procurators of the provinces that had been formerly sent, unless they were dead; whence it was that he was so negligent in hearing the causes of prisoners; insomuch that when he was asked by his friends what was the reason of his delay in such cases, he said that he delayed to hear ambassadors, lest, upon their quick dismission, other ambassadors should be appointed, and return upon him; and so he should bring trouble upon himself in their public reception and dismission: that he permitted those governors who had been sent once to their government [to stay there a long while], out of regard to the subjects that were under them; for that all governors are naturally disposed to get as much as they can; and that those who are not to fix there, but to stay a short time, and that at an uncertainty when they shall be turned out, do the more severely hurry themselves on to fleece the people; but that if their government be long continued to them; they are at last satiated with the spoils, as having gotten a vast deal, and so become at length less sharp in their pillaging; but that if successors are sent quickly, the poor subjects, who are exposed to them as a prey, will not be able to bear the new ones, while they shall not have the same time allowed them wherein their predecessors had filled themselves, and so grew more unconcerned about getting more; and this because they are removed before they have had time [for their oppressions]. He gave them an example to show his meaning: A great number of flies came about the sore places of a man that had been wounded; upon which one of the standers-by pitied the man's misfortune, and thinking he was not able to drive those flies away himself, was going to drive them away for him; but he prayed him to let them alone: the other, by way of reply, asked him the reason of such a preposterous proceeding, in preventing relief from his present misery; to which he answered, If thou drivest these flies away, thou wilt hurt me worse; for as these are already full of my blood, they do not crowd about me, nor pain me so much as before, but are somewhat more remiss, while the fresh ones that come almost famished, and find me quite tired down already, will be my destruction. For this cause, therefore, it is that I am myself careful not to send such new governors perpetually to those my subjects, who are already sufficiently harassed by many oppressions, as may, like these flies, further distress them; and so, besides their natural desire of gain, may have this additional incitement to it, that they expect to be suddenly deprived of that pleasure which they take in it. And, as a further attestation to what I say of the dilatory nature of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, I appeal to this his practice itself; for although he was emperor twenty-two years, he sent in all but two procurators to govern the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a>, and his successor in the government, <a href=/people/1789 target=_blank>Pilate</a>. Nor was he in one way of acting with respect to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and in another with respect to the rest of his subjects. He further informed them, that even in the hearing of the causes of prisoners, he made such delays, because immediate death to those that must be condemned to die would be an alleviation of their present miseries, while those wicked wretches have not deserved any such favor; but I do it, that, by being harassed with the present calamity, they may undergo greater misery. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> was greatly esteemed by <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> on all accounts, from the dignity of her relation to him, who had been his brother <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>'s wife, and from her eminent chastity; for though she was still a young woman, she continued in her widowhood, and refused all other matches, although <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> had enjoined her to be married to somebody else; yet did she all along preserve her reputation free from reproach. She had also been the greatest benefactress to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, when there was a very dangerous plot laid against him by <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>, a man who had been her husband's friend, and wire had the greatest authority, because he was general of the army, and when many members of the senate and many of the freed-men joined with him, and the soldiery was corrupted, and the plot was come to a great height. Now <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a> had certainly gained his point, had not <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>'s boldness been more wisely conducted than <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>'s malice; for when she had discovered his designs against <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, she wrote him an exact account of the whole, and gave the letter to <a href=/people/8089 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, the most faithful of her servants, and sent him to Caprere to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, who, when he understood it, slew <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a> and his confederates; so that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, who had her in great esteem before, now looked upon her with still greater respect, and depended upon her in all things. So when <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was desired by this <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> to examine <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a>, he answered, If indeed <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a> hath falsely accused <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> in what he hath said of him, he hath had sufficient punishment by what I have done to him already; but if, upon examination, the accusation appears to be true, let <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> have a care, lest, out of desire of punishing his freed-man, he do not rather bring a punishment upon himself. Now when <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> told <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> of this, he was still much more pressing that the matter might be examined into; so <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, upon <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s lying hard at her continually to beg this favor, took the following opportunity: As <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> lay once at his ease upon his sedan, and was carried about, and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, her grandson, and <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, were before him after dinner she walked by the sedan, and desired him to call <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a>, and have him examined; to which he replied, O <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>! the gods are my witnesses that I am induced to do what I am going to do, not by my own inclination, but because I am forced to it by thy prayers. When he had said this, he ordered Macro, who succeeded <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a>, to bring <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a> to him; accordingly, without any delay, he was brought. Then <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> asked him what he had to say against a man who had given him his liberty. Upon which he said, O my lord! this <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> with him, were once riding in a chariot, when I sat at their feet, and, among other discourses that passed, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> said to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, Oh that the day would once come when this old fellow will dies and name thee for the governor of the habitable earth! for then this <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, his grandson, would be no hinderance, but would be taken off by thee, and that earth would be happy, and I happy also. Now <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> took these to be truly <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s words, and bearing a grudge withal at <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, because, when he had commanded him to pay his respects to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, his grandson, and the son of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had not paid him that respect, but had disobeyed his commands, and transferred all his regard to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; he said to Macro, Bind this man. But Macro, not distinctly knowing which of them it was whom he bid him bind, and not expecting that he would have any such thing done to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, he forbore, and came to ask more distinctly what it was that he said. But when Caesar had gone round the hippodrome, he found <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> standing: For certain, said he, Macro, this is the man I meant to have bound; and when he still asked, Which of these is to be bound? he said <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>. Upon which <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> betook himself to make supplication for himself, putting him in mind of his son, with whom he was brought up, and of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> [his grandson] whom he had educated; but all to no purpose; for they led him about bound even in his purple garments. It was also very hot weather, and they had but little wine to their meal, so that he was very thirsty; he was also in a sort of agony, and took this treatment of him heinously: as he therefore saw one of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s slaves, whose name was <a href=/people/10376 target=_blank>Thaumastus</a>, carrying some water in a vessel, he desired that he would let him drink; so the servant gave him some water to drink, and he drank heartily, and said, O thou boy! this service of thine to me will be for thy advantage; for if I once get clear of these my bonds, I will soon procure thee thy freedom of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> who has not been wanting to minister to me now I am in bonds, in the same manner as when I was in my former state and dignity. Nor did he deceive him in what he promised him, but made him amends for what he had now done; for when afterward <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was come to the kingdom, he took particular care of <a href=/people/10376 target=_blank>Thaumastus</a>, and got him his liberty from <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and made him the steward over his own estate; and when he died, he left him to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> his son, and to <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a> his daughter, to minister to them in the same capacity. The man also grew old in that honorable post, and therein died. But all this happened a good while later. </p>                        </div>

Know therefore (and I appeal to my own country gods, as well as to the gods of this place, who have awarded these bonds to us) that all I am going to say about thy concerns shall neither be said for favor nor bribery, nor out of an endeavor to make thee cheerful without cause; for such predictions, when they come to fail, make the grief at last, and in earnest, more bitter than if the party had never heard of any such thing. However, though I run the hazard of my own self, I think it fit to declare to thee the prediction of the gods. It cannot be that thou shouldst long continue in these bonds; but thou wilt soon be delivered from them, and wilt be promoted to the highest dignity and power, and thou wilt be envied by all those who now pity thy hard fortune; and thou wilt be happy till thy death, and wilt leave thine happiness to the children whom thou shalt have. But do thou remember, when thou seest this bird again, that thou wilt then live but five days longer. This event will be brought to pass by that God who hath sent this bird hither to be a sign unto thee. And I cannot but think it unjust to conceal from thee what I foreknow concerning thee, that, by thy knowing beforehand what happiness is coming upon thee, thou mayst not regard thy present misfortunes. But when this happiness shall actually befall thee, do not forget what misery I am in myself, but endeavor to deliver me. So when the German had said this, he made <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> laugh at him as much as he afterwards appeared worthy of admiration. But now <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> took <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s misfortune to heart: however, to speak to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> on his behalf, she took to be a very difficult thing, and indeed quite impracticable, as to any hope of success; yet did she procure of Macro, that the soldiers that kept him should be of a gentle nature, and that the centurion who was over them and was to diet with him, should be of the same disposition, and that he might have leave to bathe himself every day, and that his freed-men and friends might come to him, and that other things that tended to ease him might be indulged him. So his friend <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a> came in to him, and two of his freed-men, <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> and Stechus, brought him such sorts of food as he was fond of, and indeed took great care of him; they also brought him garments, under pretense of selling them; and when night came on, they laid them under him; and the soldiers assisted them, as Macro had given them order to do beforehand. And this was <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s condition for six months' time, and in this case were his affairs. </p>                        </div>

At first his distemper was but gentle; but as that distemper increased upon him, he had small or no hopes of recovery. Hereupon he bid <a href=/people/5652 target=_blank>Euodus</a>, who was that freed-man whom he most of all respected, to bring the children to him, for that he wanted to talk to them before he died. Now he had at present no sons of his own alive for <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, who was his only son, was dead; but <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>'s son <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was still living, whose additional name was <a href=/people/4535 target=_blank>Gemellus</a>: there was also living Caius, the son of <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, who was the son of his brother [<a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>]. He was now grown up, and had a liberal education, and was well improved by it, and was in esteem and favor with the people, on account of the excellent character of his father <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, who had attained the highest honor among the multitude, by the firmness of his virtuous behavior, by the easiness and agreeableness of his conversing with the multitude, and because the dignity he was in did not hinder his familiarity with them all, as if they were his equals; by which behavior he was not only greatly esteemed by the people and the senate, but by every one of those nations that were subject to the Romans; some of which were affected when they came to him with the gracefulness of their reception by him, and others were affected in the same manner by the report of the others that had been with him; and, upon his death, there was a lamentation made by all men; not such a one as was to be made in way of flattery to their rulers, while they did but counterfeit sorrow, but such as was real; while every body grieved at his death, as if they had lost one that was near to them. And truly such had been his easy conversation with men, that it turned greatly to the advantage of his son among all; and, among others, the soldiery were so peculiarly affected to him, that they reckoned it an eligible thing, if need were, to die themselves, if he might but attain to the government. </p>                        </div>

When he had thus resolved within himself, he sent to his grandson's tutor, and ordered him to bring the child to him early in the morning, as supposing that God would permit him to be made emperor. But God proved opposite to his designation; for while <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was thus contriving matters, and as soon as it was at all day, he bid <a href=/people/5652 target=_blank>Euodus</a> to call in that child which should be there ready. So he went out, and found Caius before the door, for <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was not yet come, but staid waiting for his breakfast; for <a href=/people/5652 target=_blank>Euodus</a> knew nothing of what his lord intended; so he said to Caius, Thy father calls thee, and then brought him in. As soon as <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> saw Caius, and not before, he reflected on the power of God, and how the ability of bestowing the government on whom he would was entirely taken from him; and thence he was not able to establish what he had intended. So he greatly lamented that his power of establishing what he had before contrived was taken from him, and that his grandson <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was not only to lose the Roman empire by his fatality, but his own safety also, because his preservation would now depend upon such as would be more potent than himself, who would think it a thing not to be borne, that a kinsman should live with them, and so his relation would not be able to protect him; but he would be feared and bated by him who had the supreme authority, partly on account of his being next to the empire, and partly on account of his perpetually contriving to get the government, both in order to preserve himself, and to be at the head of affairs also. Now <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had been very much given to astrology, and the calculation of nativities, and had spent his life in the esteem of what predictions had proved true, more than those whose profession it was. Accordingly, when he once saw <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> coming in to him, he said to his most intimate friends, that there came in a man that would one day have the dignity of the Roman empire. So that this <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was more addicted to all such sorts of diviners than any other of the Roman emperors, because he had found them to have told him truth in his own affairs. And indeed he was now in great distress upon this accident that had befallen him, and was very much grieved at the destruction of his son's son, which he foresaw, and complained of himself, that he should have made use of such a method of divination beforehand, while it was in his power to have died without grief by this knowledge of futurity; whereas he was now tormented by his foreknowledge of the misfortune of such as were dearest to him, and must die under that torment. Now although he was disordered at this unexpected revolution of the government to those for whom he did not intend it, he spake thus to Caius, though unwillingly, and against his own inclination: O child! although <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> be nearer related to me than thou art, I, by my own determination, and the conspiring suffrage of the gods, do give and put into thy hand the Roman empire; and I desire thee never to be unmindful when thou comest to it, either of my kindness to thee, who set thee in so high a dignity, or of thy relation to <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>. But as thou knowest that I am, together with and after the gods, the procurer of so great happiness to thee; so I desire that thou wilt make me a return for my readiness to assist thee, and wilt take care of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> because of his near relation to thee. Besides which, thou art to know, that while <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> is alive, he will be a security to thee, both as to empire and as to thy own preservation; but if he die, that will be but a prelude to thy own misfortunes; for to be alone under the weight of such vast affairs is very dangerous; nor will the gods suffer those actions which are unjustly done, contrary to that law which directs men to act otherwise, to go off unpunished. This was the speech which <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> made, which did not persuade Caius to act accordingly, although he promised so to do; but when he was settled in the government, he took off this <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, as was predicted by the other <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>; as he was also himself, in no long time afterward, slain by a secret plot laid against him. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was the fourth emperor. But when the Romans understood that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was dead, they rejoiced at the good news, but had not courage to believe it; not because they were unwilling it should be true, for they would have given huge sums of money that it might be so, but because they were afraid, that if they had showed their joy when the news proved false, their joy should be openly known, and they should be accused for it, and be thereby undone. For this <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> had brought a vast number of miseries on the best families of the Romans, since he was easily inflamed with passion in all cases, and was of such a temper as rendered his anger irrevocable, till he had executed the same, although he had taken a hatred against men without reason; for he was by nature fierce in all the sentences he gave, and made death the penalty for the lightest offenses; insomuch that when the Romans heard the rumor about his death gladly, they were restrained from the enjoyment of that pleasure by the dread of such miseries as they foresaw would follow, if their hopes proved ill-grounded. Now <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a>, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s freed-man, as soon as he heard of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s death, came running to tell <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> the news; and finding him going out to the bath, he gave him a nod, and said, in the Hebrew tongue, The <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> is dead; who, understanding his meaning, and being ovejoyed at the news, Nay, said he, but all sorts of thanks and happiness attend thee for this news of thine; only I wish that what thou sayest may prove true. Now the centurion who was set to keep <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, when he saw with what haste <a href=/people/451 target=_blank>Marsyas</a> came, and what joy <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had from what he said, he had a suspicion that his words implied some great innovation of affairs, and he asked them about what was said. They at first diverted the discourse; but upon his further pressing, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, without more ado, told him, for he was already become his friend; so he joined with him in that pleasure which this news occasioned, because it would be fortunate to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, and made him a supper. But as they were feasting, and the cups went about, there came one who said that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was still alive, and would return to the city ill a few days. At which news the centurion was exceedingly troubled, because he had done what might cost him his life, to have treated so joyfully a prisoner, and this upon the news of the death of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; so he thrust <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> from the couch whereon he lay, and said, Dost thou think to cheat me by a lie about the emperor without punishment? and shalt not thou pay for this thy malicious report at the price of thine head? When he had so said, he ordered <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> to be bound again, (for he had loosed him before,) and kept a severer guard over him than formerly, and in that evil condition was <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> that night; but the next day the rumor increased in the city, and confirmed the news that <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> was certainly dead; insomuch that men durst now openly and freely talk about it; nay, some offered sacrifices on that account. Several letters also came from <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; one of them to the senate, which informed them of the death of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, and of his own entrance on the government; another to <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, the governor of the city, which told him the same thing. He also gave order that <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> should be removed out of the camp, and go to that house where he lived before he was put in prison; so that he was now out of fear as to his own affairs; for although he was still in custody, yet it was now with ease to his own affairs. Now, as soon as <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and had brought <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s dead body with him, and had made a sumptuous funeral for him, according to the laws of his country, he was much disposed to set <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> at liberty that very day; but <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a> hindered him, not out of any ill-will to the prisoner, but out of regard to decency in <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, lest that should make men believe that he received the death of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> with pleasure, when he loosed one whom he had bound immediately. However, there did not many days pass ere he sent for him to his house, and had him shaved, and made him change his raiment; after which he put a diadem upon his head, and appointed him to be king of the tetrarchy of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>. He also gave him the tetrarchy of <a href=/people/1783 target=_blank>Lysanias</a>, and changed his iron chain for a golden one of equal weight.

She was therefore grieved and much displeased at so great a mutation of his affairs; and chiefly when she saw him marching among the multitude with the usual ensigns of royal authority, she was not able to conceal how miserable she was, by reason of the envy she had towards him; but she excited her husband, and desired him that he would sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, to court honors equal to his; for she said that she could not bear to live any longer, while <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, the son of that <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> who was condemned to die by his father, one that came to her husband in such extreme poverty, that the necessaries of life were forced to be entirely supplied him day by day; and when he fled away from his creditors by sea, he now returned a king; while he was himself the son of a king, and while the near relation he bare to royal authority called upon him to gain the like dignity, he sat still, and was contented with a privater life. But then, <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, although thou wast formerly not concerned to be in a lower condition than thy father from whom thou wast derived had been, yet do thou now seek after the dignity which thy kinsman hath attained to; and do not thou bear this contempt, that a man who admired thy riches should he in greater honor than thyself, nor suffer his poverty to show itself able to purchase greater things than our abundance; nor do thou esteem it other than a shameful thing to be inferior to one who, the other day, lived upon thy charity.

But the more she saw him draw back, the more she pressed him to it, and desired him to leave no stone unturned in order to be king; and at last she left not off till she engaged him, whether he would or not, to be of her sentiments, because he could no otherwise avoid her importunity. So he got all things ready, after as sumptuous a manner as he was able, and spared for nothing, and went up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and took <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a> along with him. But <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, when he was made sensible of their intentions and preparations, he also prepared to go thither; and as soon as he heard they set sail, he sent Fortunatus, one of his freed-men, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, to carry presents to the emperor, and letters against <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, and to give <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> a particular account of those matters, if he should have any opportunity. This man followed <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> so quick, and had so prosperous a voyage, and came so little after <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, that while <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> was with <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, he came himself, and delivered his letters; for they both sailed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Dicearchia</a>, and found <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> at Baiae, which is itself a little city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, at the distance of about five furlongs from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Dicearchia</a>. There are in that place royal palaces, with sumptuous apartments, every emperor still endeavoring to outdo his predecessor's magnificence; the place also affords warm baths, that spring out of the ground of their own accord, which are of advantage for the recovery of the health of those that make use of them; and, besides, they minister to men's luxury also. Now <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> saluted <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>, for he first met with him, and then looked upon the letters which <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had sent him, and which were written in order to accuse <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>; wherein he accused him, that he had been in confederacy with <a href=/people/1081 target=_blank>Sejanus</a> against <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s and that he was now confederate with <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a>, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, in opposition to the government of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; as a demonstration of which he alleged, that he had armor sufficient for seventy thousand men ready in his armory. <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was moved at this information, and asked <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> whether what was said about the armor was true; and when he confessed there was such armor there, for he could not deny the same, the truth of it being too notorious, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> took that to be a sufficient proof of the accusation, that he intended to revolt. So he took away from him his tetrarchy, and gave it by way of addition to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s kingdom; he also gave <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a>'s money to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, and, by way of punishment, awarded him a perpetual banishment, and appointed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/458048ULug class=place long=4.8197 lat=45.7597>Lugdunum</a>, a city of Gaul, to be his place of habitation. But when he was informed that <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a> was <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s sister, he made her a present of what money was her own, and told her that it was her brother who prevented her being put under the same calamity with her husband. But she made this reply: Thou, indeed, O emperor! actest after a magnificent manner, and as becomes thyself in what thou offerest me; but the kindness which I have for my husband hinders me from partaking of the favor of thy gift; for it is not just that I, who have been made a partner in his prosperity, should forsake him in his misfortunes. Hereupon <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was angry at her, and sent her with <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> into banishment, and gave her estate to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>. And thus did God punish <a href=/people/3855 target=_blank>Herodias</a> for her envy at her brother, and <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> also for giving ear to the vain discourses of a woman. Now <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> managed public affairs with great magnanimity during the first and second year of his reign, and behaved himself with such moderation, that he gained the good-will of the Romans themselves, and of his other subjects. But, in process of time, he went beyond the bounds of human nature in his conceit of himself, and by reason of the vastness of his dominions made himself a god, and took upon himself to act in all things to the reproach of the Deity itself. </p>                        </div>

Now one of these ambassadors from the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> was <a href=/people/1363 target=_blank>Apion</a>, who uttered many blasphemies against the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, as well as to swear by his name.

So <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a> being thus affronted, went out, and said to those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a> was angry at them, and said, If indeed I were myself emperor, and were at liberty to follow my own inclination, and then had designed to act thus, these your words would be justly spoken to me; but now <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> hath sent to me, I am under the necessity of being subservient to his decrees, because a disobedience to them will bring upon me inevitable destruction. Then the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> replied, Since, therefore, thou art so disposed, O <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>! that thou wilt not disobey <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s letters, neither will we transgress the commands of our law; and as we depend upon the excellency of our laws, and, by the labors of our ancestors, have continued hitherto without suffering them to be transgressed, we dare not by any means suffer ourselves to be so timorous as to transgress those laws out of the fear of death, which God hath determined are for our advantage; and if we fall into misfortunes, we will bear them, in order to preserve our laws, as knowing that those who expose themselves to dangers have good hope of escaping them, because God will stand on our side, when, out of regard to him, we undergo afflictions, and sustain the uncertain turns of fortune. But if we should submit to thee, we should be greatly reproached for our cowardice, as thereby showing ourselves ready to transgress our law; and we should incur the great anger of God also, who, even thyself being judge, is superior to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. </p>                        </div>

Thus did he readily bring the multitude to be cheerful again. And now did God show his presence to <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, and signify to him that he would afford him his assistance in his whole design; for he had no sooner finished the speech that he made to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, but God sent down great showers of rain, contrary to human expectation; for that day was a clear day, and gave no sign, by the appearance of the sky, of any rain; nay, the whole year had been subject to a great drought, and made men despair of any water from above, even when at any time they saw the heavens overcast with clouds; insomuch that when such a great quantity of rain came, and that in an unusual manner, and without any other expectation of it, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> hoped that <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a> would by no means fail in his petition for them.

This was also among those other particulars which he wrote to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, which all tended to dissuade him, and by all means to entreat him not to make so many ten thousands of these men go distracted; whom, if he should slay, (for without war they would by no means suffer the laws of their worship to be set aside,) he would lose the revenue they paid him, and would be publicly cursed by them for all future ages.

So <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, when he had drank wine plentifully, and was merrier than ordinary, said thus during the feast, when <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> had drunk to him: I knew before now how great a respect thou hast had for me, and how great kindness thou hast shown me, though with those hazards to thyself, which thou underwentest under <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> on that account; nor hast thou omitted any thing to show thy good-will towards us, even beyond thy ability; whence it would be a base thing for me to be conquered by thy affection. I am therefore desirous to make thee amends for every thing in which I have been formerly deficient; for all that I have bestowed on thee, that may be called my gifts, is but little. Everything that may contribute to thy happiness shall be at thy service, and that cheerfully, and so far as my ability will reach. And this was what <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> said to <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, thinking be would ask for some large country, or the revenues of certain cities. But although he had prepared beforehand what he would ask, yet had he not discovered his intentions, but made this answer to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> immediately: That it was not out of any expectation of gain that he formerly paid his respects to him, contrary to the commands of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, nor did he now do any thing relating to him out of regard to his own advantage, and in order to receive any thing from him; that the gifts he had already bestowed upon him were great, and beyond the hopes of even a craving man; for although they may be beneath thy power, [who art the donor,] yet are they greater than my inclination and dignity, who am the receiver. And as <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was astonished at <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s inclinations, and still the more pressed him to make his request for somewhat which he might gratify him with, <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> replied, Since thou, O my lord! declarest such is thy readiness to grant, that I am worthy of thy gifts, I will ask nothing relating to my own felicity; for what thou hast already bestowed on me has made me excel therein; but I desire somewhat which may make thee glorious for piety, and render the Divinity assistant to thy designs, and may be for an honor to me among those that inquire about it, as showing that I never once fail of obtaining what I desire of thee; for my petition is this, that thou wilt no longer think of the dedication of that statue which thou hast ordered to be set up in the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> by <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>. </p>                        </div>

So <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, who was mightily taken with <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s obliging behavior, and on other accounts thinking it a dishonorable thing to be guilty of falsehood before so many witnesses, in points wherein he had with such alacrity forced <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> to become a petitioner, and that it would look as if he had already repented of what he had said, and because he greatly admired <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>'s virtue, in not desiring him at all to augment his own dominions, either with larger revenues, or other authority, but took care of the public tranquillity, of the laws, and of the Divinity itself, he granted him what he had requested. He also wrote thus to <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, commending him for his assembling his army, and then consulting him about these affairs. If therefore, said' he, thou hast already erected my statue, let it stand; but if thou hast not yet dedicated it, do not trouble thyself further about it, but dismiss thy army, go back, and take care of those affairs which I sent thee about at first, for I have now no occasion for the erection of that statue.

When therefore <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was much displeased that any attempt should be made against his government as he was a slave to base and vicious actions on all occasions, and had no regard to What was virtuous and honorable, and against whomsoever he resolved to show his anger, and that for any cause whatsoever, he suffered not himself to be restrained by any admonition, but thought the indulging his anger to be a real pleasure, he wrote thus to <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>: Seeing thou esteemest the presents made thee by the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to be of greater value than my commands, and art grown insolent enough to be subservient to their pleasure, I charge thee to become thy own judge, and to consider what thou art to do, now thou art under my displeasure; for I will make thee an example to the present and to all future ages, that they. may not dare to contradict the commands of their emperor. </p>                        </div>

Inferior it was to none of the calamities which had gone before, and came together with a great slaughter of them, and that greater than any upon record before; concerning all which I shall speak accurately, and shall explain the occasions whence these miseries came upon them. There was a city of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> called <a href=/people/6693 target=_blank>Neerda</a>; not only a ver populous one, but one that had a good and a large territory about it, and, besides its other advantages, full of men also. It was, besides, not easily to be assaulted by enemies, from the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> encompassing it all round, and from the wails that were built about it. There was also the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371412UNis class=place long=41.2149 lat=37.067>Nisibis</a>, situate on the same current of the river. For which reason the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, depending on the natural strength of these places, deposited in them that half shekel which every one, by the custom of our country, offers unto God, as well as they did other things devoted to him; for they made use of these cities as a treasury, whence, at a proper time, they were transmitted to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; and many ten thousand men undertook the carriage of those donations, out of fear of the ravages of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, to whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> were then subject. Now there were two men, <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> and <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>, of the city <a href=/people/6693 target=_blank>Neerda</a> by birth, and brethren to one another. They were destitute of a father, and their mother put them to learn the art of weaving curtains, it not being esteemed disgrace among them for men to be weavers of cloth. Now he that taught them that art, and was set over them, complained that they came too late to their work, and punished them with stripes; but they took this just punishment as an affront, and carried off all the weapons which were kept in that house, which were not a few, and went into a certain place where was a partition of the rivers, and was a place naturally very fit for the feeding of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and for preserving such fruits as were usually laid up against winter. The poorest sort of the young men also resorted to them, whom they armed with the weapons they had gotten, and became their captains; and nothing hindered them from being their leaders into mischief; for as soon as they were become invincible, and had built them a citadel, they sent to such as fed <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, and ordered them to pay them so much tribute out of them as might be sufficient for their maintenance, proposing also that they would be their friends, if they would submit to them, and that they would defend them from all their other enemies on every side, but that they would kill the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> of those that refused to obey them. So they hearkened to their proposals, (for they could do nothing else,) and sent them as many <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> as were required of them; whereby their forces grew greater, and they became lords over all they pleased, because they marched suddenly, and did them a mischief, insomuch that every body who had to do with them chose to pay them respect; and they became formidable to such as came to assault them, till the report about them came to the ears of the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> himself. </p>                        </div>

He then encamped at a lake, and lay still; but on the next day (it was the sabbath, which is among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> a day of rest from all sorts of work) he supposed that the enemy would not dare to fight him thereon, but that he would take them and carry them away prisoners, without fighting. He therefore proceeded gradually, and thought to fall upon them on the sudden. Now <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> was sitting with the rest, and their weapons lay by them; upon which he said, Sirs, I hear a neighing of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>; not of such as are feeding, but such as have men on their backs; I also hear such a noise of their bridles, that I am afraid that some enemies are coming upon us to encompass us round. However, let somebody go to look about, and make report of what reality there is in the present state of things; and may what I have said prove a false alarm. And when he had said this, some of them went out to spy out what was the matter; and they came again immediately, and said to him, that neither hast thou been mistaken in telling us what our enemies were doing, nor will those enemies permit us to be injurious to people any longer. We are caught by their intrigues like brute beasts, and there is a large body of cavalry marching upon us, while we are destitute of hands to defend ourselves withal, because we are restrained from doing it by the prohibition of our law, which obliges us to rest [on this day]. But Asiueus did not by any means agree with the opinion of his spy as to what was to be done, but thought it more agreeable to the law to pluck up their spirits in this necessity they were fallen into, and break their law by avenging themselves, although they should die in the action, than by doing nothing to please their enemies in submitting to be slain by them. Accordingly, he took up his weapons, and infused courage into those that were with him to act as courageously as himself. So they fell upon their enemies, and slew a great many of them, because they despised them and came as to a certain victory, and put the rest to flight. </p>                        </div>

He therefore sent the most trusty of all his guards to say thus to them: That king Artsbanus, although he had been unjustly treated by you, who have made an attempt against his government, yet hath he more regard to your courageous behavior, than to the anger he bears to you, and hath sent me to give you his right hand and security; and he permits you to come to him safely, and without any violence upon the road; and he wants to have you address yourselves to him as friends, without meaning any guile or deceit to you. He also promises to make you presents, and to pay you those respects which will make an addition of his power to your courage, and thereby be of advantage to you. Yet did <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> himself put off his journey thither, but sent his brother <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> with all such presents as he could procure. So he went, and was admitted to the king's presence; and when <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> saw <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> coming alone, he inquired into the reason why <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> avoided to come along with him; and when he understood that he was afraid, and staid by the lake, he took an oath, by the gods of his country, that he would do them no harm, if they came to him upon the assurances he gave them, and gave him his right hand. This is of the greatest force there with all these barbarians, and affords a firm security to those who converse with them; for none of them will deceive you when once they have given you their right hands, nor will any one doubt of their fidelity, when that is once given, even though they were before suspected of injustice. When <a href=/people/703 target=_blank>Artabanus</a> had done this, he sent away <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> to persuade his brother to come to him. Now this the king did, because he wanted to curb his own governors of provinces by the courage of these <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> brethren, lest they should make a league with them; for they were ready for a revolt, and were disposed to rebel, had they been sent on an expedition against them. He was also afraid, lest when he was engaged in a war, in order to subdue those governors of provinces that had revolted, the party of <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a>, and those in <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a>, should be augmented, and either make war upon him, when they should hear of that revolt, or if they should be disappointed in that case, they would not fail of doing further mischief to him. </p>                        </div>

But if thou be a truly warlike man, thou standest not in need of my perjury. Go thou then, and avenge the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> government; attack this man, when he is returned back, and conquer him by the forces that are under thy command, without my privity. Hereupon the king called for <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a>, and said to him, It is time for thee, O thou young man! to return home, and not provoke the indignation of my generals in this place any further, lest they attempt to murder thee, and that without my approbation. I commit to thee the country of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> in trust, that it may, by thy care, be preserved free from robbers, and from other mischiefs. I have kept my faith inviolable to thee, and that not in trifling affairs, but in those that concerned thy safety, and do therefore deserve thou shouldst be kind to me. When he had said this, and given <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> some presents, he sent him away immediately; who, when he was come home, built fortresses, and became great in a little time, and managed things with such courage and success, as no other person, that had no higher a beginning, ever did before him. Those <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> governors also, who were sent that way, paid him great respect; and the honor that was paid him by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> seemed to them too small, and beneath his deserts, although he were in no small dignity and power there; nay, indeed, all the affairs of <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a> depended upon him, and he more and more flourished in this happy condition of his for fifteen years. </p>                        </div>

When once they had deviated from that course of virtue whereby they had gained so great power, they affronted and transgressed the laws of their forefathers, and fell under the dominion of their lusts and pleasures. A certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a>, who came as general of an army into those parts, had a wife following him, who had a vast reputation for other accomplishments, and particularly was admired above all other women for her beauty. <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a>, either heard of that her beauty from others, or perhaps saw her himself also, and so became at once her lover and her enemy; partly because he could not hope to enjoy this woman but by obtaining power over her as a captive, and partly because he thought he could not conquer his inclinations for her. As soon therefore as her husband had been declared an enemy to them, and was fallen in the battle, the widow of the deceased was married to this her lover. However, this woman did not come into their house without producing great misfortunes, both to <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> himself, and to <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> also; but brought great mischiefs upon them on the occasion following. Since she was led away captive, upon the death of her husband, she concealed the images of those gods which were their country gods, common to her husband and to herself: now it was the custom of that country for all to have the idols they worship in their own houses, and to carry them along with them when they go into a foreign land; agreeable to which custom of theirs she carried her idols with her. Now at first she performed her worship to them privately; but when she was become <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>'s married wife, she worshipped them in her accustomed manner, and with the same appointed ceremonies which she used in her former husband's days; upon which their most esteemed friends blamed him at first, that he did not act after the manner of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, nor perform what was agreeable to their laws, in marrying a foreign wife, and one that transgressed the accurate appointments of their sacrifices and religious ceremonies; that he ought to consider, lest, by allowing himself in many pleasures of the body, he might lose his principality, on account of the beauty of a wife, and that high authority which, by God's blessing, he had arrived at. But when they prevailed not at all upon him, he slew one of them for whom he had the greatest respect, because of the liberty he took with him; who, when he was dying, out of regard to the laws, imprecated a punishment upon his murderer <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>, and upon <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> also, and that all their companions might come to a like end from their enemies; upon the two first as the principal actors of this wickedness, and upon the rest as those that would not assist him when he suffered in the defense of their laws. Now these latter were sorely grieved, yet did they tolerate these doings, because they remembered that they had arrived at their present happy state by no other means than their fortitude. But when they also heard of the worship of those gods whom the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> adore, they thought the injury that <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> offered to their laws was to be borne no longer; and a greater number of them came to <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a>, and loudly complained of Aniteus, and told him that it had been well that he had of himself seen what was advantageous to them; but that however it was now high time to correct what had been done amiss, before the crime that had been committed proved the ruin of himself and all the rest of them. They added, that the marriage of this woman was made without their consent, and without a regard to their old laws; and that the worship which this woman paid [to her gods] was a reproach to the God whom they worshipped. Now <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a> was sensible of his brother's offense, that it had been already the cause of great mischiefs, and would be so for the time to come; yet did he tolerate the same from the good-will he had to so near a relation, and forgiving it to him, on account that his brother was quite overborne by his wicked inclinations. But as more and more still came about him every day, and the clamors about it became greater, he at length spake to <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> about these clamors, reproving him for his former actions, and desiring him for the future to leave them off, and send the woman back to her relations. But nothing was gained by these reproofs; for as the woman perceived what a tumult was made among the people on her account, and was afraid for <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>, lest he should come to any harm for his love to her, she infused poison into <a href=/people/2695 target=_blank>Asineus</a>'s food, and thereby took him off, and was now secure of prevailing, when her lover was to be judge of what should be done about her. </p>                        </div>

Now when <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, who was there at this time, heard that his villages were taken, he was very much displeased to find that <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> had first begun to injure him, and to affront him in his present dignity, when he had not offered any injury to him beforehand; and he got together the greatest body of horsemen he was able, and those out of that number which were of an age fit for war, and came to fight <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a>; and when he was arrived at a certain village of his own, he lay still there, as intending to fight him on the day following, because it was the sabbath, the day on which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> rest. And when <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> was informed of this by a Syrian stranger of another village, who not only gave him an exact account of other circumstances, but told him where <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> would have a feast, he took his supper at a proper time, and marched by night, with an intent of falling upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> while they were unapprized what they should do; so he fell upon them about the fourth watch of the night, and some of them he slew while they were asleep, and others he put to flight, and took <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> alive, and set him naked upon an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a> which, among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, is esteemed the greatest reproach possible. And when he had brought him into a wood with such a resolution, and his friends desired him to kill <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, he soon told them his own mind to the contrary, and said that it was not right to kill a man who was of one of the principal families among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, and greatly honored with matching into the royal family; that so far as they had hitherto gone was tolerable; for although they had injured <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, yet if they preserved his life, this benefit would be remembered by him to the advantage of those that gave it him; but that if be were once put to death, the king would not be at rest till he had made a great slaughter of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that dwelt at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>; to whose safety we ought to have a regard, both on account of our relation to them, and because if any misfortune befall us, we have no other place to retire to, since he hath gotten the flower of their youth under him. By this thought, and this speech of his made in council, he persuaded them to act accordingly; so <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> was let go. But when he was got away, his wife reproached him, that although he was son-in-law to the king, he neglected to avenge himself on those that had injured him, while he took no care about it, but was contented to have been made a captive by the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and to have escaped them; and she bid him either to go back like a man of courage, or else she sware by the gods of their royal family that she would certainly dissolve her marriage with him. Upon which, partly because he could not bear the daily trouble of her taunts, and partly because he was afraid of her insolence, lest she should in earnest dissolve their marriage, he unwillingly, and against his inclinations, got together again as great an army as he could, and marched along with them, as himself thinking it a thing not to be borne any longer, that he, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a>, should owe his preservation to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, when they had been too hard for him in the war. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, he led out his army, and a great many more joined themselves to that army, in order to betake themselves to plunder the people, and in order to terrify the enemy again by their numbers. But when they had marched ninety furlongs, while the road had been through dry [and sandy] places, and about the midst of the day, they were become very thirsty; and <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> appeared, and fell upon them, as they were in distress for want of water, on which account, and on account of the time of the day, they were not able to bear their weapons. So <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> and his men were put to an ignominious rout, while men in despair were to attack those that were fresh and in good plight; so a great slaughter was made, and many ten thousand men fell.

But there now came in to <a href=/people/1770 target=_blank>Anileus</a> a conflux of bad men, who regarded their own lives very little, if they might but gain some present ease, insomuch that they, by thus coming to him, compensated the multitude of those that perished in the fight.

When, therefore, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were come thither, and dwelt among them, there arose a sedition, and the Syrians were too hard for the other, by the assistance of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, who are men that despise dangers, and very ready to fight upon any occasion. Now when the Greeks had the worst in this sedition, and saw that they had but one way of recovering their former authority, and that was, if they could prevent the agreement between the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> and the Syrians, they every one discoursed with such of the Syrians as were formerly their acquaintance, and promised they would be at peace and friendship with them. Accordingly, they gladly agreed so to do; and when this was done by the principal men of both nations, they soon agreed to a reconciliation; and when they were so agreed, they both knew that the great design of such their union would be their common hatred to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. Accordingly, they fell upon them, and slew about fifty thousand of them; nay, the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> were all destroyed, excepting a few who escaped, either by the compassion which their friends or neighbors afforded them, in order to let them fly away.

FROM THE DEPARTURE OUT OF BABYLON TO FADUS, THE ROMAN PROCURATOR. NOW this <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> did not demonstrate his madness in offering injuries only to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, or to those that dwelt in the neighborhood; but suffered it to extend itself through all the earth and sea, so far as was in subjection to the Romans, and filled it with ten thousand mischiefs; so many indeed in number as no former history relates. But <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> itself felt the most dismal effects of what he did, while he deemed that not to be any way more honorable than the rest of the cities; but he pulled and hauled its other citizens, but especially the senate, and particularly the nobility, and such as had been dignified by illustrious ancestors; he also had ten thousand devices against such of the equestrian order, as it was styled, who were esteemed by the citizens equal in dignity and wealth with the senators, because out of them the senators were themselves chosen; these he treated after all ignominious manner, and removed them out of his way, while they were at once slain, and their wealth plundered, because he slew men generally in order to seize on their riches. He also asserted his own divinity, and insisted on greater honors to be paid him by his subjects than are due to mankind. He also frequented that temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> which they style the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, which is with them the most holy of all their temples, and had boldness enough to call himself the brother of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. And other pranks he did like a madman; as when he laid a bridge from the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Dicearchia</a>, which belongs to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=place long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campania</a>, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenum</a>, another city upon the sea-side, from one promontory to another, of the length of thirty furlongs, as measured over the sea. And this was done because he esteemed it to be a most tedious thing to row over it in a small ship, and thought withal that it became him to make that bridge, since he was lord of the sea, and might oblige it to give marks of obedience as well as the earth; so he enclosed the whole bay within his bridge, and drove his chariot over it; and thought that, as he was a god, it was fit for him to travel over such roads as this was. Nor did he abstain from the plunder of any of the Grecian temples, and gave order that all the engravings and sculptures, and the rest of the ornaments of the statues and donations therein dedicated, should be brought to him, saying that the best things ought to be set no where but in the best place, and that the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was that best place. He also adorned his own house and his gardens with the curiosities brought from those temples, together with the houses he lay at when he traveled all over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; whence he did not scruple to give a command that the statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/3220 target=_blank>Olympius</a>, so called because he was honored at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games by the Greeks, which was the work of <a href=/people/402 target=_blank>Phidias</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, should be brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Yet did not he compass his end, because the architects told <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a>, who was commanded to remove that statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, that the workmanship was such as would be spoiled, and would not bear the removal. It was also reported that <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, both on that account, and on account of some such mighty prodigies as are of an incredible nature, put off the taking it down, and wrote to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> those accounts, as his apology for not having done what his letter required of him; and that when he was thence in danger of perishing, he was saved by <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> being dead himself, before he had put him to death. </p>                        </div>

He also gave leave to slaves to accuse their masters of any crimes whatsoever they pleased; for all such accusations were terrible, because they were in great part made to please him, and at his suggestion, insomuch that <a href=/people/4273 target=_blank>Pollux</a>, <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>'s slave, had the boldness to lay an accusation against <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> himself; and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was not ashamed to be present at his trial of life and death, to hear that trial of his own uncle, in hopes of being able to take him off, although he did not succeed to his mind. But when he had filled the whole habitable world which he governed with false accusations and miseries, and had occasioned the greatest insults of slaves against their masters, who indeed in a great measure ruled them, there were many secret plots now laid against him; some in anger, and in order for men to revenge themselves, on account of the miseries they had already undergone from him; and others made attempts upon him, in order to take him off before they should fall into such great miseries, while his death came very fortunately for the preservation of the laws of all men, and had a great influence upon the public welfare; and this happened most happily for our nation in particular, which had almost utterly perished if he had not been suddenly slain. And I confess I have a mind to give a full account of this matter particularly, because it will afford great assurance of the power of God, and great comfort to those that are under afflictions, and wise caution to those who think their happiness will never end, nor bring them at length to the most lasting miseries, if they do not conduct their lives by the principles of virtue. </p>                        </div>

Another conspiracy there was laid by them, under the conduct of <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, the tribune [of the Pretorian band]. <a href=/people/2898 target=_blank>Minucianus</a> Annins was also one of great consequence among those that were prepared to oppose his tyranny. Now the several occasions of these men's several hatred and conspiracy against <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> were these: <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> had indignation and hatred against all injustice, for he had a mind naturally angry, and bold, and free, which made him not conceal his counsels; so he communicated them to many of his friends, and to others who seemed to him persons of activity and vigor: <a href=/people/2898 target=_blank>Minucianus</a> entered into this conspiracy, because of the injustice done to <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> his particular friend, and one of the best character of all the citizens, whom <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had slain, as also because he was afraid of himself, since <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s wrath tended to the slaughter of all alike: and for <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>, he came in, because he thought it a deed worthy of a free ingenuous man to kill <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and was ashamed of the reproaches he lay under from <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, as though he were a coward; as also because he was himself in danger every day from his friendship with him, and the observance he paid him. These men proposed this attempt to all the rest that were concerned, who saw the injuries that were offered them, and were desirous that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s slaughter might succeed by their mutual assistance of one another, and they might themselves escape being killed by the taking off <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; that perhaps they should gain their point; and that it would be a happy thing, if they should gain it, to approve themselves to so many excellent persons, as earnestly wished to be partakers with them in their design for the delivery of the city and of the government, even at the hazard of their own lives. But still <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was the most zealous of them all, both out of a desire of getting himself the greatest name, and also by reason of his access to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s presence with less danger, because he was tribune, and could therefore the more easily kill him. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, they most importunately desired that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> would now ease them in their tributes, and abate somewhat of the rigor of their taxes imposed upon them; but he would not hear their petition; and when their clamors increased, he sent soldiers some one way and some another, and gave order that they should lay hold on those that made the clamors, and without any more ado bring them out, and put them to death. These were <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s commands, and those who were commanded executed the same; and the number of those who were slain on this occasion was very great. Now the people saw this, and bore it so far, that they left off clamoring, because they saw with their own eyes that this petition to be relieved, as to the payment of their money, brought immediate death upon them.

But <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had set him to require the tributes, and other dues, which, when not paid in due time, were forfeited to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s treasury; and he had made some delays in requiring them, because those burdens had been doubled, and had rather indulged his own mild disposition than performed <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s command; nay, indeed, be provoked <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> to anger by his sparing men, and pitying the hard fortunes of those from whom he demanded the taxes; and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> upbraided him with his sloth and effeminacy in being so long about collecting the taxes. And indeed he did not only affront him in other respects, but when he gave him the watchword of the day, to whom it was to be given by his place, he gave him feminine words, and those of a nature very reproachful; and these watchwords he gave out, as having been initiated in the secrets of certain mysteries, which he had been himself the author of. Now although he had sometimes put on women's clothes, and had been wrapt in some embroidered garments to them belonging, and done a great many other things, in order to make the company mistake him for a woman; yet did he, by way of reproach, object the like womanish behavior to <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>. But when <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> received the watchword from him, he had indignation at it, but had greater indignation at the delivery of it to others, as being laughed at by those that received it; insomuch that his fellow tribunes made him the subject of their drollery; for they would foretell that he would bring them some of his usual watchwords when he was about to take the watchword from <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and would thereby make him ridiculous; on which accounts he took the courage of assuming certain partners to him, as having just reasons for his indignation against <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. Now there was one <a href=/people/8197 target=_blank>Pompedius</a>, a senator, and one who had gone through almost all posts in the government, but otherwise an <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a>, and for that reason loved to lead an inactive life. Now <a href=/people/10411 target=_blank>Timidius</a>, an enemy of his, had informed <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> that he had used indecent reproaches against him, and he made use of <a href=/people/6868 target=_blank>Quintilia</a> for a witness to them; a woman she was much beloved by many that frequented the theater, and particularly by <a href=/people/8197 target=_blank>Pompedius</a>, on account of her great beauty. Now this woman thought it a horrible thing to attest to an accusation that touched the life of her lover, which was also a lie. <a href=/people/10411 target=_blank>Timidius</a>, however, wanted to have her brought to the torture. <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was irritated at this reproach upon him, and commanded <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>, without any delay, to torture <a href=/people/6868 target=_blank>Quintilia</a>, as he used to employ <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> in such bloody matters, and those that required the torture, because he thought he would do it the more barbarously, in order to avoid that imputation of effeminacy which he had laid upon him. But <a href=/people/6868 target=_blank>Quintilia</a>, when she was brought to the rack, trod upon the foot of one of her associates, and let him know that he might be of good courage, and not be afraid of the consequence of her tortures, for that she would bear them with magnanimity. <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> tortured this woman after a cruel manner; unwillingly indeed, but because he could not help it. He then brought her, without being in the least moved at what she had suffered, into the presence of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and that in such a state as was sad to behold; and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, being somewhat affected with the sight of <a href=/people/6868 target=_blank>Quintilia</a>, who had her body miserably disordered by the pains she had undergone, freed both her and <a href=/people/8197 target=_blank>Pompedius</a> of the crime laid to their charge. He also gave her money to make her an honorable amends, and comfort her for that maiming of her body which she had suffered, and for her glorious patience under such insufferable torments. </p>                        </div>

How great then is our virtue in submitting to conduct his armies! <a href=/people/1620 target=_blank>Clement</a> held his peace, but showed the shame he was under in obeying <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s orders, both by his eyes and his blushing countenance, while he thought it by no means right to accuse the emperor in express words, lest their own safety should be endangered thereby. Upon which <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> took courage, and spake to him without fear of the dangers that were before him, and discoursed largely of the sore calamities under which the city and the government then labored, and said, We may indeed pretend in words that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> is the person unto whom the cause of such miseries ought to be imputed; but, in the opinion of such as are able to judge uprightly, it is I, O <a href=/people/1620 target=_blank>Clement</a>! and this Papinius, and before us thou thyself, who bring these tortures upon the Romans, and upon all mankind. It is not done by our being subservient to the commands of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, but it is done by our own consent; for whereas it is in our power to put an end to the life of this man, who hath so terribly injured the citizens and his subjects, we are his guard in mischief, and his executioners instead of his soldiers, and are the instruments of his cruelty. We bear these weapons, not for our liberty, not for the Roman government, but only for his preservation, who hath enslaved both their bodies and their minds; and we are every day polluted with the blood that we shed, and the torments we inflict upon others; and this we do, till somebody becomes <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s instrument in bringing the like miseries upon ourselves. Nor does he thus employ us because he hath a kindness for us, but rather because he hath a suspicion of us, as also because when abundance more have been killed, (for <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> will set no bounds to his wrath, since he aims to do all, not out of regard to justice, but to his own pleasure,) we shall also ourselves be exposed to his cruelty; whereas we ought to be the means of confirming the security and liberty of all, and at the same time to resolve to free ourselves from dangers. </p>                        </div>

I am zealous about this action, nor am I solicitous what I may myself undergo; for I can not at leisure to consider the dangers that may come upon myself, so deeply am I troubled at the slavery our once free country is now under, and at the contempt cast upon our excellent laws, and at the destruction which hangs over all men, by the means of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>.

Whether somebody that was conscious of what he was about, gave a signal for his encouragement, or whether it was God himself, who looks upon the actions of men, that encouraged him to go on boldly in his design, is uncertain. The plot was now communicated to a great many, and they were all in their armor; some of the conspirators being senators, and some of the equestrian order, and as many of the soldiery as were made acquainted with it; for there was not one of them who would not reckon it a part of his happiness to kill <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; and on that account they were all very zealous in the affair, by what means soever any one could come at it, that he might not be behindhand in these virtuous designs, but might be ready with all his alacrity or power, both by words and actions, to complete this slaughter of a tyrant. And besides these, <a href=/people/3789 target=_blank>Callistus</a> also, who was a freed-man of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and was the only man that had arrived at the greatest degree of power under him, — such a power, indeed, as was in a manner equal to the power of the tyrant himself, by the dread that all men had of him, and by the great riches he had acquired; for he took bribes most plenteously, and committed injuries without bounds, and was more extravagant in the use of his power in unjust proceedings than any other. He also knew the disposition of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> to be implacable, and never to be turned from what he had resolved on. He had withal many other reasons why he thought himself in danger, and the vastness of his wealth was not one of the least of them; on which account he privately ingratiated himself with <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, and transferred his courtship to him, out of this hope, that in case, upon the removal of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, the government should come to him, his interest in such changes should lay a foundation for his preserving his dignity under him, since he laid in beforehand a stock of merit, and did <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> good offices in his promotion. He had also the boldness to pretend that he had been persuaded to make away with <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, by poisoning him, but had still invented ten thousand excuses for delaying to do it. But it seems probable to me that <a href=/people/3789 target=_blank>Callistus</a> only counterfeited this, in order to ingratiate himself with <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; for if <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had been in earnest resolved to take off <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, he would not have admitted of <a href=/people/3789 target=_blank>Callistus</a>'s excuses; nor would <a href=/people/3789 target=_blank>Callistus</a>, if he had been enjoined to do such an act as was desired by <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, have put it off; nor if he had disobeyed those injunctions of his master, had he escaped immediate punishment; while <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was preserved from the madness of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> by a certain Divine providence, and <a href=/people/3789 target=_blank>Callistus</a> pretended to such a piece of merit as he no way deserved. </p>                        </div>

Thus was Chorea angry at his fellow conspirators, for fear they should suffer a proper opportunity to pass by; and they were themselves sensible that he had just cause to be angry at them, and that his eagerness was for their advantage; yet did they desire he would have a little longer patience, lest, upon any disappointment they might meet with, they should put the city into disorder, and an inquisition should be made after the conspiracy, and should render the courage of those that were to attack <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> without success, while he would then secure himself more carefully than ever against them; that it would therefore be the best to set about the work when the shows were exhibited in the palace.

Then <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> called the conspirators together, and spake thus to them: So much time passed away without effort is a reproach to us, as delaying to go through such a virtuous design as we are engaged in; but more fatal will this delay prove if we be discovered, and the design be frustrated; for <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> will then become more cruel in his unjust proceedings. Do we not see how long we deprive all our friends of their liberty, and give <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> leave still to tyrannize over them? while we ought to have procured them security for the future, and, by laying a foundation for the happiness of others, gain to ourselves great admiration and honor for all time to come. Now while the conspirators had nothing tolerable to say by way of contradiction, and yet did not quite relish what they were doing, but stood silent and astonished, he said further, O my brave comrades! why do we make such delays? Do not you see that this is the last day of these shows, and that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> is about to go to sea? for he is preparing to sail to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, in order to see <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Is it therefore for your honor to let a man go out of your hands who is a reproach to mankind, and to permit him to go, after a pompous manner, triumphing both at land and sea? Shall not we be justly ashamed of ourselves, if we give leave to some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> or other, who shall think his injuries insufferable to free-men, to kill him? As for myself, I will no longer bear your stow proceedings, but will expose myself to the dangers of the enterprise this very day, and bear cheerfully whatsoever shall be the consequence of the attempt; nor, let them be ever so great, will I put them off any longer: for, to a wise and courageous man, what can be more miserable than that, while I am alive, any one else should kill <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and deprive me of the honor of so virtuous an action? </p>                        </div>

So he was at the palace in the morning, with his equestrian sword girt on him; for it was the custom that the tribunes should ask for the watchword with their swords on, and this was the day on which <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was, by custom, to receive the watchword; and the multitude were already come to the palace, to be soon enough for seeing the shows, and that in great crowds, and one tumultuously crushing another, while <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was delighted with this eagerness of the multitude; for which reason there was no order observed in the seating men, nor was any peculiar place appointed for the senators, or for the equestrian order; but they sat at random, men and women together, and free-men were mixed with the slaves. So <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> came out in a solemn manner, and offered sacrifice to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus Caesar</a>, in whose honor indeed these shows were celebrated. Now it happened, upon the fall of a certain priest, that the garment of <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a>, a senator, was filled with blood, which made <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> laugh, although this was an evident omen to <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a>, for he was slain at the same time with <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. It is also related that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was that day, contrary to his usual custom, so very affable and good-natured in his conversation, that every one of those that were present were astonished at it. After the sacrifice was over, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> betook himself to see the shows, and sat down for that purpose, as did also the principal of his friends sit near him. Now the parts of the theater were so fastened together, as it used to be every year, in the manner following: It had two doors, the one door led to the open air, the other was for going into, or going out of, the cloisters, that those within the theater might not be thereby disturbed; but out of one gallery there went an inward passage, parted into partitions also, which led into another gallery, to give room to the combatants and to the musicians to go out as occasion served. When the multitude were set down, and <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>, with the other tribunes, were set down also, and the right corner of the theater was allotted to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, one <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, a senator, commander of the praetorian band, asked of <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a>, one that sat by him, and was of consular dignity also, whether he had heard any thing of news, or not? but took care that nobody should hear what he said; and when <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a> replied, that he had heard no news, Know then, said <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, that the game of the slaughter of tyrants is to be played this day. But <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a> replied O brave comrade hold thy peace, lest some other of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaians</a> hear thy tale. And as there was abundance of autumnal fruit thrown among the spectators, and a great number of birds, that were of great value to such as possessed them, on account of their rareness, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was pleased with the birds fighting for the fruits, and with the violence wherewith the spectators seized upon them: and here he perceived two prodigies that happened there; for an actor was introduced, by whom a leader of robbers was crucified, and the pantomime brought in a play called <a href=/people/976 target=_blank>Cinyras</a>, wherein he himself was to be slain, as well as his daughter Myrrha, and wherein a great deal of fictitious blood was shed, both about him that was crucified, and also about <a href=/people/976 target=_blank>Cinyras</a>. It was also confessed that this was the same day wherein <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, a friend of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1308 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, who was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, slew him, as he was entering into the theater. And now <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was in doubt whether he should tarry to the end of the shows, because it was the last day, or whether he should not go first to the bath, and to dinner, and then return and sit down as before. Hereupon <a href=/people/2898 target=_blank>Minucianus</a>, who sat over <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and was afraid that the opportunity should fail them, got up, because he saw <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was already gone out, and made haste out, to confirm him in his resolution; but <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> took hold of his garment, in an obliging way, and said to him, O brave man! whither art thou going? Whereupon, out of reverence to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, as it seemed, he sat down again; but his fear prevailed over him, and in a little time he got up again, and then <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> did no way oppose his going out, as thinking that he went out to perform some necessities of nature. And <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a>, who was one of the confederates, persuaded <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> to go out to the bath, and to dinner, and then to come in again, as desirous that what had been resolved on might be brought to a conclusion immediately. </p>                        </div>

And as they were just going back into the entrance to the theater, word was brought them that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was arisen, whereby a tumult was made; hereupon the conspirators thrust away the crowd, under pretense as if <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was angry at them, but in reality as desirous to have a quiet place, that should have none in it to defend him, while they set about <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s slaughter. Now <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, his uncle, was gone out before, and Marcus <a href=/people/4740 target=_blank>Vinicius</a> his sister's husband, as also Valellus of Asia; whom though they had had such a mind to put out of their places, the reverence to their dignity hindered them so to do; then followed <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, with <a href=/people/200 target=_blank>Paulus</a> <a href=/people/3344 target=_blank>Arruntius</a>: and because <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was now gotten within the palace, he left the direct road, along which those his servants stood that were in waiting, and by which road <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> had gone out before, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> turned aside into a private narrow passage, in order to go to the place for bathing, as also in order to take a view of the boys that came out of Asia, who were sent thence, partly to sing hymns in these mysteries which were now celebrated, and partly to dance in the Pyrrhic way of dancing upon the theatres. So <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> met him, and asked him for the watchword; upon <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s giving him one of his ridiculous words, he immediately reproached him, and drew his sword, and gave him a terrible stroke with it, yet was not this stroke mortal. And although there be those that say it was so contrived on purpose by Chorea, that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> should not be killed at one blow, but should be punished more severely by a multitude of wounds; yet does this story appear to me incredible, because the fear men are under in such actions does not allow them to use their reason. And if <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was of that mind, I esteem him the greatest of all fools, in pleasing himself in his spite against <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, rather than immediately procuring safety to himself and to his confederates from the dangers they were in, because there might many things still happen for helping <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s escape, if he had not already given up the ghost; for certainly <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> would have regard, not so much to the punishment of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, as to the affliction himself and his friends were in, while it was in his power, after such success, to keep silent, and to escape the wrath of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s defenders, and not to leave it to uncertainty whether he should gain the end he aimed at or not, and after an unreasonable manner to act as if he had a mind to ruin himself, and lose the opportunity that lay before him. But every body may guess as he please about this matter. However, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was staggered with the pain that the blow gave him; for the stroke of the sword falling in the middle, between the shoulder and the neck, was hindered by the first bone of the breast from proceeding any further. Nor did he either cry out, (in such astonishment was he,) nor did he call out for any of his friends; whether it were that he had no confidence in them, or that his mind was otherwise disordered, but he groaned under the pain he endured, and presently went forward and fled; when <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, who was already prepared in his mind so to do, thrust him down upon his knee, where many of them stood round about him, and struck him with their swords; and they cried out, and encouraged one another all at once to strike him again; but all agree that <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a> gave him the finishing stroke, which directly killed him. But one may justly ascribe this act to <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>; for although many concurred in the act itself, yet was he the first contriver of it, and began long before all the rest to prepare for it, and was the first man that boldly spake of it to the rest; and upon their admission of what he said about it, he got the dispersed conspirators together; he prepared every thing after a prudent manner, and by suggesting good advice, showed himself far superior to the rest, and made obliging speeches to them, insomuch that he even compelled them all to go on, who otherwise had not courage enough for that purpose; and when opportunity served to use his sword in hand, he appeared first of all ready so to do, and gave the first blow in this virtuous slaughter; he also brought <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> easily into the power of the rest, and almost killed him himself, insomuch that it is but just to ascribe all that the rest did to the advice, and bravery, and labors of the hands of <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>. </p>                        </div>

Now <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> and his associates, upon <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s slaughter, saw that it was impossible for them to save themselves, if they should all go the same way, partly on account of the astonishment they were under; for it was no small danger they had incurred by killing an emperor, who was honored and loved by the madness of the people, especially when the soldiers were likely to make a bloody inquiry after his murderers. The passages also were narrow wherein the work was done, which were also crowded with a great multitude of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s attendants, and of such of the soldiers as were of the emperor's guard that day; whence it was that they went by other ways, and came to the house of <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>, the father of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, whom they had now killed (which house adjoined to the palace; for while the edifice was one, it was built in its several parts by those particular persons who had been emperors, and those parts bare the names of those that built them or the name of him who had begun to build its parts). So they got away from the insults of the multitude, and then were for the present out of danger, that is, so long as the misfortune which had overtaken the emperor was not known. The Germans were the first who perceived that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was slain. These Germans were <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s guard, and carried the name of the country whence they were chosen, and composed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> legion. The men of that country are naturally passionate, which is commonly the temper of some other of the barbarous nations also, as being not used to consider much about what they do; they are of robust bodies and fall upon their enemies as soon as ever they are attacked by them; and which way soever they go, they perform great exploits. When, therefore, these German guards understood that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was slain, they were very sorry for it, because they did not use their reason in judging about public affairs, but measured all by the advantages themselves received, <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> being beloved by them because of the money he gave them, by which he had purchased their kindness to him; so they drew their swords, and <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a> led them on. He was one of the tribunes, not by the means of the virtuous actions of his pro genitors, for he bad been a gladiator, but he had obtained that post in the army by his having a robust body. So these Germans marched along the houses in quest of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s murderers, and cut <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a> to pieces, because he was the first man they fell upon, and whose garment it was that the blood of the sacrifices stained, as I have said already, and which foretold that this his meeting the soldiers would not be for his good. Then did <a href=/people/1374 target=_blank>Norbanus</a> meet them, who was one of the principal nobility of and could show many generals of armies among his ancestors; but they paid no regard to his dignity; yet was he of such great strength, that he wrested the sword of the first of those that assaulted him out of his hands, and appeared plainly not to be willing to die without a struggle for his life, until he was surrounded by a great number of assailants, and died by the multitude of the wounds which they gave him. The third man was Anteius, a senator, and a few others with him. He did not meet with these Germans by chance, as the rest did before, but came to show his hatred to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and because he loved to see <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> lie dead with his own eyes, and took a pleasure in that sight; for <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had banished Anteius's father, who was of the same name with himself, and being not satisfied with that, he sent out his soldiers, and slew him; so he was come to rejoice at the sight of him, now he was dead. But as the house was now all in a tumult, when he was aiming to hide himself, he could not escape that accurate search which the Germans made, while they barbarously slew those that were guilty, and those that were not guilty, and this equally also. And thus were these [three] persons slain. </p>                        </div>

There were also those who greatly distrusted it, because they were unwilling that any such thing should come to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, nor could believe it, though it were ever so true, because they thought no man could possibly so much power as to kill <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. These were the women, and the children, and the slaves, and some of the soldiery. This last sort had taken his pay, and in a manner tyrannized with him, and had abused the best of the citizens, in being subservient to his unjust commands, in order to gain honors and advantages to themselves; but for the women and the youth, they had been inveigled with shows, and the fighting of the gladiators, and certain distributions of flesh-meat among them, which things them pretense were designed for the pleasing of multitude, but in reality to satiate the barbarous cruelty and madness of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. The slaves also were sorry, because they were by <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> allowed to accuse and to despise their masters, and they could have recourse to his assistance when they had unjustly affronted them; for he was very easy in believing them against their masters, even when they the city, accused them falsely; and if they would discover what money their masters had, they might soon obtain both riches and liberty, as the rewards of their accusations, because the reward of these informers was the eighth part of the criminal's substance. As to the nobles, although the report appeared credible to some of them, either because they knew of the plot beforehand, or because they wished it might be true; however, they concealed not only the joy they had at the relation of it, but that they had heard any thing at all about it. These last acted so out of the fear they had, that if the report proved false, they should be punished, for having so soon let men know their minds. But those that knew <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was dead, because they were partners with the conspirators, they concealed all still more cautiously, as not knowing one another's minds; and fearing lest they should speak of it to some of those to whom the continuance of tyranny was advantageous; and if <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> should prove to be alive, they might be informed against, and punished. And another report went about, that although <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had been wounded indeed, yet was not he dead, but alive still, and under the physician's hands. Nor was any one looked upon by another as faithful enough to be trusted, and to whom any one would open his mind; for he was either a friend to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and therefore suspected to favor his tyranny, or he was one that hated him, who therefore might be suspected to deserve the less credit, because of his ill-will to him. Nay, it was said by some (and this indeed it was that deprived the nobility of their hopes, and made them sad) that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was in a condition to despise the dangers he had been in, and took no care of healing his wounds, but was gotten away into the market-place, and, bloody as he was, was making an harangue to the people. And these were the conjectural reports of those that were so unreasonable as to endeavor to raise tumults, which they turned different ways, according to the opinions of the bearers. Yet did they not leave their seats, for fear of being accused, if they should go out before the rest; for they should not be sentenced according to the real intention with which they went out, but according to the supposals of the accusers and of the judges. </p>                        </div>

And when the Germans came upon them, the cry was so great, that the theater rang again with the entreaties of the spectators to the soldiers, pleading that they were entirely ignorant of every thing that related to such seditious contrivances, and that if there were any sedition raised, they knew nothing of it; they therefore begged that they would spare them, and not punish those that had not the least hand in such bold crimes as belonged to other persons, while they neglected to search after such as had really done whatsoever it be that hath been done. Thus did these people appeal to God, and deplore their infelicity with shedding of tears, and beating their faces, and said every thing that the most imminent danger and the utmost concern for their lives could dictate to them. This brake the fury of the soldiers, and made them repent of what they minded to do to the spectators, which would have been the greatest instance of cruelty. And so it appeared to even these savages, when they had once fixed the heads of those that were slain with <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a> upon the altar; at which sight the spectators were sorely afflicted, both upon the consideration of the dignity of the persons, and out of a commiseration of their sufferings; nay, indeed, they were almost in as great disorder at the prospect of the danger themselves were in, seeing it was still uncertain whether they should entirely escape the like calamity. Whence it was that such as thoroughly and justly hated <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> could yet no way enjoy the pleasure of his death, because they were themselves in jeopardy of perishing together with him; nor had they hitherto any firm assurance of surviving. </p>                        </div>

This man put himself into the most mournful habit he could, although he had a greater hatred against <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> than any one else; his fear and his wise contrivance to gain his safety taught him so to do, and prevailed over his present pleasure; so he put on such a mournful dress as he would have done had he lost his dearest friends in the world; this man came into the theater, and informed them of the death of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and by this means put an end to that state of ignorance the men had been in. <a href=/people/3344 target=_blank>Arruntius</a> also went round about the pillars, and called out to the Germans, as did the tribunes with him, bidding them put up their swords, and telling them that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was dead. And this proclamation it was plainly which saved those that were collected together in the theater, and all the rest who any way met the Germans; for while they had hopes that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had still any breath in him, they abstained from no sort of mischief; and such an abundant kindness they still had for <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, that they would willingly have prevented the plot against him, and procured his escape from so sad a misfortune, at the expense of their own lives. But they now left off the warm zeal they had to punish his enemies, now they were fully satisfied that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was dead, because it was now in vain for them to show their zeal and kindness to him, when he who should reward them was perished. They were also afraid that they should be punished by the senate, if they should go on in doing such injuries; that is, in case the authority of the supreme governor should revert to them.

There was also one Aleyon, a physician, who hurried away, as if to cure those that were wounded, and under that pretense he sent those that were with him to fetch what things were necessary for the healing of those wounded persons, but in reality to get them clear of the present dangers they were in.

He replied, I wish I had been the man. The consuls also published an edict, wherein they accused <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, and gave order to the people then got together, and to the soldiers, to go home; and gave the people hopes of the abatement of the oppressions they lay under; and promised the soldiers, if they lay quiet as they used to do, and would not go abroad to do mischief unjustly, that they would bestow rewards upon them; for there was reason to fear lest the city might suffer harm by their wild and ungovernable behavior, if they should once betake themselves to spoil the citizens, or plunder the temples.

How long indeed this will last is uncertain, and lies at the disposal of the gods, whose grant it is; yet such it is as is sufficient to make us rejoice, and be happy for the present, although we may soon be deprived of it; for one hour is sufficient to those that are exercised in virtue, wherein we may live with a mind accountable only to ourselves, in our own country, now free, and governed by such laws as this country once flourished under. As for myself, I cannot remember our former time of liberty, as being born after it was gone; but I am beyond measure filled with joy at the thoughts of our present freedom. I also esteem those that were born and bred up in that our former liberty happy men, and that those men are worthy of no less esteem than the gods themselves who have given us a taste of it in this age; and I heartily wish that this quiet enjoyment of it, which we have at present, might continue to all ages. However, this single day may suffice for our youth, as well as for us that are in years. It will seem an age to our old men, if they might die during its happy duration: it may also be for the instruction of the younger sort, what kind of virtue those men, from whose loins we are derived, were exercised in. As for ourselves, our business is, during the space of time, to live virtuously, than which nothing can be more to our advantage; which course of virtue it is alone that can preserve our liberty; for as to our ancient state, I have heard of it by the relations of others; but as to our later state, during my lifetime, I have known it by experience, and learned thereby what mischiefs tyrannies have brought upon this commonwealth, discouraging all virtue, and depriving persons of magnanimity of their liberty, and proving the teachers of flattery and slavish fear, because it leaves the public administration not to be governed by wise laws, but by the humor of those that govern. For since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a> took it into his head to dissolve our democracy, and, by overbearing the regular system of our laws, to bring disorders into our administration, and to get above right and justice, and to be a slave to his own inclinations, there is no kind of misery but what hath tended to the subversion of this city; while all those that have succeeded him have striven one with another to overthrow the ancient laws of their country, and have left it destitute of such citizens as were of generous principles, because they thought it tended to their safety to have vicious men to converse withal, and not only to break the spirits of those that were best esteemed for their virtue, but to resolve upon. their utter destruction. Of all which emperors, who have been many in number, and who laid upon us insufferable hardships during the times of their government, this <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, who hath been slain today, hath brought more terrible calamities upon us than did all the rest, not only by exercising his ungoverned rage upon his fellow citizens, but also upon his kindred and friends, and alike upon all others, and by inflicting still greater miseries upon them, as punishments, which they never deserved, he being equally furious against men and against the gods. For tyrants are not content to gain their sweet pleasure, and this by acting injuriously, and in the vexation they bring both upon men's estates and their wives; but they look upon that to be their principal advantage, when they can utterly overthrow the entire families of their enemies; while all lovers of liberty are the enemies of tyranny. Nor can those that patiently endure what miseries they bring on them gain their friendship; for as they are conscious of the abundant mischiefs they have brought on these men, and how magnanimously they have borne their hard fortunes, they cannot but be sensible what evils they have done, and thence only depend on security from what they are suspicious of, if it may be in their power to take them quite out of the world. Since, then, we are now gotten clear of such great misfortunes, and are only accountable to one another, (which form of government affords us the best assurance of our present concord, and promises us the best security from evil designs, and will be most for our own glory in settling the city in good order,) you ought, every one of you in particular, to make provision for his own, and in general for the public utility: or, on the contrary, they may declare their dissent to such things as have been proposed, and this without any hazard of danger to come upon them, because they have now no lord set over them, who, without fear of punishment, could do mischief to the city, and had an uncontrollable power to take off those that freely declared their opinions. Nor has any thing so much contributed to this increase of tyranny of late as sloth, and a timorous forbearance of contradicting the emperor's will; while men had an over-great inclination to the sweetness of peace, and had learned to live like slaves; and as many of us as either heard of intolerable calamities that happened at a distance from us, or saw the miseries that were near us, out of the dread of dying virtuously, endured a death joined with the utmost infamy. We ought, then, in the first place, to decree the greatest honors we are able to those that have taken off the tyrant, especially to <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>; for this one man, with the assistance of the gods, hath, by his counsel and by his actions, been the procurer of our liberty. Nor ought we to forget him now we have recovered our liberty, who, under the foregoing tyranny, took counsel beforehand, and beforehand hazarded himself for our liberties; but ought to decree him proper honors, and thereby freely declare that he from the beginning acted with our approbation. And certainly it is a very excellent thing, and what becomes free-men, to requite their benefactors, as this man hath been a benefactor to us all, though not at all like <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, who slew <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> [<a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>]; for those men laid the foundations of sedition and civil wars in our city; but this man, together with his slaughter of the tyrant, hath set our city free from all those sad miseries which arose from the tyranny. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, in order to finish this matter with the utmost zeal, and in order to satisfy his hatred of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, he sent <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> Lupus, one of the tribunes, to kill <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s wife and daughter. They proposed this office to Lupus as to a kinsman of <a href=/people/1620 target=_blank>Clement</a>, that he might be so far a partaker of this murder of the tyrant, and might rejoice in the virtue of having assisted his fellow citizens, and that he might appear to have been a partaker with those that were first in their designs against him. Yet did this action appear to some of the conspirators to be too cruel, as to this using such severity to a woman, because <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> did more indulge his own ill-nature than use her advice in all that he did; from which ill-nature it was that the city was in so desperate a condition with the miseries that were brought on it, and the flower of the city was destroyed. But others accused her of giving her consent to these things; nay, they ascribed all that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had done to her as the cause of it, and said she had given a potion to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, which had made him obnoxious to her, and had tied him down to love her by such evil methods; insomuch that she, having rendered him distracted, was become the author of all the mischiefs that had befallen the Romans, and that habitable world which was subject to them. So that at length it was determined that she must die; nor could those of the contrary opinion at all prevail to have her saved; and Lupus was sent accordingly. Nor was there any delay made in executing what he went about, but he was subservient to those that sent him on the first opportunity, as desirous to be no way blameable in what might be done for the advantage of the people. So when he was come into the palace, he found Cesonia, who was <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s wife, lying by her husband's dead body, which also lay down on the ground, and destitute of all such things as the law allows to the dead, and all over herself besmeared with the blood of her husband's wounds, and bewailing the great affliction she was under, her daughter lying by her also; and nothing else was heard in these her circumstances but her complaint of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, as if he had not regarded what she had often told him of beforehand; which words of hers were taken in a different sense even at that time, and are now esteemed equally ambiguous by those that hear of them, and are still interpreted according to the different inclinations of people. Now some said that the words denoted that she had advised him to leave off his mad behavior and his barbarous cruelty to the citizens, and to govern the public with moderation and virtue, lest he should perish by the same way, upon their using him as he had used them. But some said, that as certain words had passed concerning the conspirators, she desired <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> to make no delay, but immediately to put them all to death, and this whether they were guilty or not, and that thereby he would be out of the fear of any danger; and that this was what she reproached him for, when she advised him so to do, but he was too slow and tender in the matter. And this was what Cesonia said, and what the opinions of men were about it. But when she saw Lupus approach, she showed him <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s dead body, and persuaded him to come nearer, with lamentation and tears; and as she perceived that Lupus was in disorder, and approached her in order to execute some design disagreeable to himself, she was well aware for what purpose he came, and stretched out her naked throat, and that very cheerfully to him, bewailing her case, like one that utterly despaired of her life, and bidding him not to boggle at finishing the tragedy they had resolved upon relating to her. So she boldly received her death's wound at the hand of Lupus, as did the daughter after her. So Lupus made haste to inform <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> of what he had done. </p>                        </div>

He was, even before he came to be emperor, ill-natured, and one that had arrived at the utmost pitch of wickedness; a slave to his pleasures, and a lover of calumny; greatly affected by every terrible accident, and on that account of a very murderous disposition where he durst show it. He enjoyed his exorbitant power to this only purpose, to injure those who least deserved it, with unreasonable insolene and got his wealth by murder and injustice. He labored to appear above regarding either what was divine or agreeable to the laws, but was a slave to the commendations of the populace; and whatsoever the laws determined to be shameful, and punished, that he esteemed more honorable than what was virtuous. He was unmindful of his friends, how intimate soever, and though they were persons of the highest character; and if he was once angry at any of them, he would inflict punishment upon them on the smallest occasions, and esteemed every man that endeavored to lead a virtuous life his enemy. And whatsoever he commanded, he would not admit of any contradiction to his inclinations; whence it was that he had criminal conversation with his own sister; from which occasion chiefly it was also that a bitter hatred first sprang up against him among the citizens, that sort of incest not having been known of a long time; and so this provoked men to distrust him, and to hate him that was guilty of it. And for any great or royal work that he ever did, which might be for the present and for future ages, nobody can name any such, but only the haven that he made about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, for the reception of the ships that brought corn from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; which was indeed a work without dispute very great in itself, and of very great advantage to the navigation. Yet was not this work brought to perfection by him, but was the one half of it left imperfect, by reason of his want of application to it; the cause of which was this, that he employed his studies about useless matters, and that by spending his money upon such pleasures as concerned no one's benefit but his own, he could not exert his liberality in things that were undeniably of great consequence. Otherwise he was an excellent orator, and thoroughly acquainted with the Greek tongue, as well as with his own country or Roman language. He was also able, off-hand and readily, to give answers to compositions made by others, of considerable length and accuracy. He was also more skillful in persuading others to very great things than any one else, and this from a natural affability of temper, which had been improved by much exercise and pains-taking; for as he was the grandson of the brother of <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>, whose successor he was, this was a strong inducement to his acquiring of learning, because <a href=/people/370 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> aspired after the highest pitch of that sort of reputation; and <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> aspired after the like glory for eloquence, being induced thereto by the letters of his kinsman and his emperor. He was also among the first rank of his own citizens. But the advantages he received from his learning did not countervail the mischief he brought upon himself in the exercise of his authority; so difficult it is for those to obtain the virtue that is necessary for a wise man, who have the absolute power to do what they please without control. At the first he got himself such friends as were in all respects the most worthy, and was greatly beloved by them, while he imitated their zealous application to the learning and to the glorious actions of the best men; but when he became insolent towards them, they laid aside the kindness they had for him, and began to hate him; from which hatred came that plot which they raised against him, and wherein he perished. </p>                        </div>

Now all those that were at this consultation had little regard to the punishment <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> had suffered, because he justly deserved such his fortune; but they were rather considering their own circumstances, how they might take the best care of themselves, especially while the Germans were busy in punishing the murderers of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; which yet was rather done to gratify their own savage temper, than for the good of the public; all which things disturbed <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who was afraid of his own safety, and this particularly because he saw the heads of <a href=/people/2998 target=_blank>Asprenas</a> and his partners carried about. His station had been on a certain elevated place, whither a few steps led him, and whither he had retired in the dark by himself. But when <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a>, who was one of the soldiers that belonged to the palace, saw him, but did not well know by his countenance who he was, because it was dark, though he could well judge that it was a man who was privately there on some design, he came nearer to him; and when <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> desired that he would retire, be discovered who he was, and owned him to be <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>. So he said to his followers, This is a <a href=/people/380 target=_blank>Germanicus</a>; come on, let us choose him for our emperor. But when <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> saw they were making preparations for taking him away by force, and was afraid they would kill him, as they had killed <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, he besought them to spare him, putting them in mind how quietly he had demeaned himself, and that he was unacquainted with what had been done. Hereupon <a href=/people/3030 target=_blank>Gratus</a> smiled upon him, and took him by the right hand, and said, Leave off, sir, these low thoughts of saving yourself, while you ought to have greater thoughts, even of obtaining the empire, which the gods, out of their concern for the habitable world, by taking <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> out of the way, commit to thy virtuous conduct. Go to, therefore, and accept of the throne of thy ancestors. So they took him up and carried him, because he was not then able to go on foot, such was his dread and his joy at what was told him. </p>                        </div>

They reflected also on the covetous temper of the leading men of the senate, and what great errors they had been guilty of when the senate had the government formerly; they also considered the impossibility of such an undertaking, as also what dangers they should be in, if the government should come to a single person, and that such a one should possess it as they had no hand in advancing, and not to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who would take it as their grant, and as gained by their good-will to him, and would remember the favors they had done him, and would make them a sufficient recompense for the same. </p>                        </div>

But as to the populace and senators, they disagreed in their opinions. The latter were very desirous to recover their former dignity, and were zealous to get clear of the slavery that had been brought on them by the injurious treatment of the tyrants, which the present opportunity afforded them; but for the people, who were envious against them, and knew that the emperors were capable of curbing their covetous temper, and were a refuge from them, they were very glad that <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> had been seized upon, and brought to them, and thought that if <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> were made emperor, he would prevent a civil war, such as there was in the days of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. But when the senate knew that <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was brought into the camp by the soldiers, they sent to him those of their body which had the best character for their virtues, that they might inform him that he ought to do nothing by violence, in order to gain the government; that he who was a single person, one either already or hereafter to be a member of their body, ought to yield to the senate, which consisted of so great a number; that he ought to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related to the public order, and to remember how greatly the former tyrants had afflicted their city, and what dangers both he and they had escaped under <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>; and that he ought not to hate the heavy burden of tyranny, when the injury is done by others, while he did himself willfully treat his country after a mad and insolent manner; that if he would comply with them, and demonstrate that his firm resolution was to live quietly and virtuously, he would have the greatest honors decreed to him that a free people could bestow; and by subjecting himself to the law, would obtain this branch of commendation, that he acted like a man of virtue, both as a ruler and a subject; but that if he would act foolishly, and learn no wisdom by <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s death, they would not permit him to go on; that a great part of the army was got together for them, with plenty of weapons, and a great number of slaves, which they could make use of; that good hope was a great matter in such cases, as was also good fortune; and that the gods would never assist any others but those that undertook to act with virtue and goodness, who can be no other than such as fight for the liberty of their country. </p>                        </div>

Now this <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, with relation to <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, did what became one that had been so much honored by him; for he embraced <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s body after he was dead, and laid it upon a bed, and covered it as well as he could, and went out to the guards, and told them that <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> was still alive; but he said that they should call for physicians, since he was very ill of his wounds. But when he had learned that <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was carried away violently by the soldiers, he rushed through the crowd to him, and when he found that he was in disorder, and ready to resign up the government to the senate, he encouraged him, and desired him to keep the government; but when he had said this to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, he retired home. And upon the senate's sending for him, he anointed his head with ointment, as if he had lately accompanied with his wife, and had dismissed her, and then came to them: he also asked of the senators what <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> did; who told him the present state of affairs, and then asked his opinion about the settlement of the public. He told them in words that he was ready to lose his life for the honor of the senate, but desired them to consider what was for their advantage, without any regard to what was most agreeable to them; for that those who grasp at government will stand in need of weapons and soldiers to guard them, unless they will set up without any preparation for it, and so fall into danger. And when the senate replied that they would bring in weapons in abundance, and money, and that as to an army, a part of it was already collected together for them, and they would raise a larger one by giving the slaves their liberty, — <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> made answer, O senators! may you be able to compass what you have a mind to; yet will I immediately tell you my thoughts, because they tend to your preservation. Take notice, then, that the army which will fight for <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> hath been long exercised in warlike affairs; but our army will be no better than a rude multitude of raw men, and those such as have been unexpectedly made free from slavery, and ungovernable; we must then fight against those that are skillful in war, with men who know not so much as how to draw their swords. So that my opinion is, that we should send some persons to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, to persuade him to lay down the government; and I am ready to be one of your ambassadors. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> said to the ambassadors, that he did not wonder the senate had no mind to have an emperor over them, because they had been harassed by the barbarity of those that had formerly been at the head of their affairs; but that they should taste of an equitable government under him, and moderate times, while he should only he their ruler in name, but the authority should be equally common to them all; and since he had passed through many and various scenes of life before their eyes, it would be good for them not to distrust him.

However, a hundred and no more were gotten together; and as they were in consultation about the present posture of affairs, a sudden clamor was made by the soldiers that were on their side, desiring that the senate would choose them an emperor, and not bring the government into ruin by setting up a multitude of rulers. So they fully declared themselves to be for the giving the government not to all, but to one; but they gave the senate leave to look out for a person worthy to be set over them, insomuch that now the affairs of the senate were much worse than before, because they had not only failed in the recovery of their liberty, which they boasted themselves of, but were in dread of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> also.

When they were in these circumstances, <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was not able to contain the anger he had, and promised, that if they desired an emperor, he would give them one, if any one would bring him the watchword from <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a>. Now this <a href=/people/3025 target=_blank>Eutychus</a> was charioteer of the green-band faction, styled Prasine, and a great friend of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>, who used to harass the soldiery with building stables for the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and spent his time in ignominious labors, which occasioned <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> to reproach them with him, and to abuse them with much other scurrilous language; and told them he would bring them the head of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>; and that it was an amazing thing, that, after their former madness, they should commit their government to a fool. Yet were not they moved with his words, but drew their swords, and took up their ensigns, and went to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, to join in taking the oath of fidelity to him. So the senate were left without any body to defend them, and the very consuls differed nothing from private persons. They were also under consternation and sorrow, men not knowing what would become of them, because <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> was very angry at them; so they fell a reproaching one another, and repented of what they had done.

However, king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> went up to <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, and desired he would treat the senators more gently; for if any mischief should come to the senate, he would have no others over whom to rule. <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> complied with him, and called the senate together into the palace, and was carried thither himself through the city, while the soldiery conducted him, though this was to the great vexation of the multitude; for <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> and <a href=/people/573 target=_blank>Sabinus</a>, two of <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>'s murderers, went in the fore-front of them, in an open manner, while <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>, whom <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, a little before, had made captain of his guards, had sent them an epistolary edict, to forbid them to appear in public. Then did <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, upon his coming to the palace, get his friends together, and desired their suffrages about <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a>. They said that the work he had done was a glorious one; but they accused him the he did it of perfidiousness, and thought it just to inflict the punishment [of death] upon him, to discountenance such actions for the time to come. So <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> was led to his execution, and Lupus and many other Romans with him. Now it is reported that <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> bore this calamity courageously; and this not only by the firmness of his own behavior under it, but by the reproaches he laid upon Lupus, who fell into tears; for when Lupus laid his garment aside, and complained of the cold he said, that cold was never hurtful to Lupus [i.e. a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>] And as a great many men went along with them to see the sight, when <a href=/people/1003 target=_blank>Cherea</a> came to the place, he asked the soldier who was to be their executioner, whether this office was what he was used to, or whether this was the first time of his using his sword in that manner, and desired him to bring him that very sword with which he himself slew <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a>. So he was happily killed at one stroke. But Lupus did not meet with such good fortune in going out of the world, since he was timorous, and had many blows leveled at his neck, because he did not stretch it out boldly [as he ought to have done]. </p>                        </div>

So he wrote the following letter to the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=place long=22.4 lat=38.7>Doris</a> in an angry strain: Publius <a href=/people/908 target=_blank>Petronius</a>, the president under Tiberius <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Caesar Augustus Germanicus, to the magistrates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/326349UDor class=place long=34.9169 lat=32.6175>Doris</a>, ordains as follows: Since some of you have had the boldness, or madness rather, after the edict of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Caesar Augustus Germanicus was published, for permitting the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to observe the laws of their country, not to obey the same, but have acted in entire opposition thereto, as forbidding the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to assemble together in the synagogue, by removing <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s statue, and setting it up therein, and thereby have offended not only the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, but the emperor himself, whose statue is more commodiously placed in his own temple than in a foreign one, where is the place of assembling together; while it is but a part of natural justice, that every one should have the power over the place belonging peculiarly to themselves, according to the determination of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, — to say nothing of my own determination, which it would be ridiculous to mention after the emperor's edict, which gives the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> leave to make use of their own customs, as also gives order that they enjoy equally the rights of citizens with the Greeks themselves, — I therefore ordain that <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> <a href=/people/690 target=_blank>Vitellius</a>, the centurion, bring those men to me, who, contrary to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>'s edict, have been so insolent as to do this thing, at which those very men, who appear to be of principal reputation among them, have an indignation also, and allege for themselves, 'that it was not done with their consent, but by the violence of the multitude, that they may give an account of what hath been done. I also exhort the principal magistrates among them, unless they have a mind to have this action esteemed to be done with their consent, to inform the centurion of those that were guilty of it, and take care that no handle be hence taken for raising a sedition or quarrel among them; which those seem to me to treat after who encourage such doings; while both I myself, and king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, for whom I have the highest honor, have nothing more under our care, than that the nation of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> may have no occasion given them of getting together, under the pretense of avenging themselves, and become tumultuous. And that it may be more publicly known what <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> hath resolved about this whole matter, I have subjoined those edicts which he hath lately caused to be published at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and which, although they may be well known to all, yet did king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, for whom I have the highest honor, read them at that time before my tribunal, and pleaded that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> ought not to be deprived of those rights which <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> hath granted them. I therefore charge you, that you do not, for the time to come, seek for any occasion of sedition or disturbance, but that every one be allowed to follow their own religious customs. </p>                        </div>

And now king <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> took the [high] priesthood away from <a href=/people/369 target=_blank>Simon</a> <a href=/people/7433 target=_blank>Cantheras</a>, and put <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2089 target=_blank>Ananus</a>, into it again, and owned that he was more worthy of that dignity than the other. But this was not a thing acceptable to him, to recover that his former dignity. So he refused it, and said, O king! I rejoice in the honor that thou hast for me, and take it kindly that thou wouldst give me such a dignity of thy own inclinations, although God hath judged that I am not at all worthy of the high priesthood. I am satisfied with having once put on the sacred garments; for I then put them on after a more holy manner than I should now receive them again. But if thou desirest that a person more worthy than myself should have this honorable employment, give me leave to name thee such a one. I have a brother that is pure from all sin against God, and of all offenses against thyself; I recommend him to thee, as one that is fit for this dignity.

Accordingly, he would no where let the king sit as his superior, and took the like liberty in speaking to him upon all occasions, till he became troublesome to the king, when they were merry together, extolling himself beyond measure, and oft putting the king in mind of the severity of fortune he had undergone, that he might, by way of ostentation, demonstrate What zeal he had showed in his service; and was continually harping upon this string, what pains he had taken for him, and much enlarged still upon that subject. The repetition of this so frequently seemed to reproach the king, insomuch that he took this ungovernable liberty of talking very ill at his hands. For the commemoration of times when men have been under ignominy, is by no means agreeable to them; and he is a very silly man who is perpetually relating to a person what kindness he had done him. At last, therefore, <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a> had so thoroughly provoked the king's indignation, that he acted rather out of passion than good consideration, and did not only turn <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a> out of his place, as general of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, but sent him in bonds into his own country. But the edge of his anger wore off by length of time, and made room for more just reasonings as to his judgment about this man; and he considered how many labors he had undergone for his sake. So when <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> was solemnizing his birth-day, and he gave festival entertainments to all his subjects, he sent for <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a> on the sudden to be his guest. But as he was a very frank man, he thought he had now a just handle given him to be angry; which he could not conceal from those that came for him, but said to them, What honor is this the king invites me to, which I conclude will soon be over? For the king hath not let me keep those original marks of the good-will I bore him, which I once had from him; but he hath plundered me, and that unjustly also. Does he think that I can leave off that liberty of speech, which, upon the consciousness of my deserts, I shall use more loudly than before, and shall relate how many misfortunes I have been delivered from; how many labors I have undergone for him, whereby I procured him deliverance and respect; as a reward for which I have borne the hardships of bonds and a dark prison? I shall never forget this usage. Nay, perhaps, my very soul, when it is departed out of the body, will not forget the glorious actions I did on his account. This was the clamor he made, and he ordered the messengers to tell it to the king. So he perceived that <a href=/people/1850 target=_blank>Silas</a> was incurable in his folly, and still suffered him to lie in prison. </p>                        </div>

However, while these kings staid with him, Marcus, the president of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, came thither. So the king, in order to preserve the respect that was due to the Romans, went out of the city to meet him, as far as seven furlongs. But this proved to be the beginning of a difference between him and Marcus; for he took with him in his chariot those other kings as his assessors. But Marcus had a suspicion what the meaning could be of so great a friendship of these kings one with another, and did not think so close an agreement of so many potentates to be for the interest of the Romans. He therefore sent some of his domestics to every one of them, and enjoined them to go their ways home without further delay. This was very ill taken by <a href=/people/12034 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, who after that became his enemy.

At which festival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons, and such as were of dignity through his province. On the second day of which shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of a contexture truly wonderful, and came into the theater early in the morning; at which time the silver of his garment being illuminated by the fresh reflection of the sun's rays upon it, shone out after a surprising manner, and was so resplendent as to spread a horror over those that looked intently upon him; and presently his flatterers cried out, one from one place, and another from another, (though not for his good,) that he was a god; and they added, Be thou merciful to us; for although we have hitherto reverenced thee only as a man, yet shall we henceforth own thee as superior to mortal nature. Upon this the king did neither rebuke them, nor reject their impious flattery. But as he presently afterward looked up, he saw an <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> sitting on a certain rope over his head, and immediately understood that this bird was the messenger of ill tidings, as it had once been the messenger of good tidings to him; and fell into the deepest sorrow. A severe pain also arose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. He therefore looked upon his friends, and said, I, whom you call a god, am commanded presently to depart this life; while Providence thus reproves the lying words you just now said to me; and I, who was by you called immortal, am immediately to be hurried away by death. But I am bound to accept of what Providence allots, as it pleases God; for we have by no means lived ill, but in a splendid and happy manner. When he said this, his pain was become violent. Accordingly he was carried into the palace, and the rumor went abroad every where, that he would certainly die in a little time. But the multitude presently sat in sackcloth, with their wives and children, after the law of their country, and besought God for the king's recovery. All places were also full of mourning and lamentation. Now the king rested in a high chamber, and as he saw them below lying prostrate on the ground, he could not himself forbear weeping. And when he had been quite worn out by the pain in his belly for five days, he departed this life, being in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and in the seventh year of his reign; for he reigned four years under <a href=/people/1618 target=_blank>Caius</a> <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, three of them were over <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s tetrarchy only, and on the fourth he had that of <a href=/people/68 target=_blank>Herod</a> added to it; and he reigned, besides those, three years under the reign of <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> Caesar; in which time he reigned over the forementioned countries, and also had <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> added to them, as well as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=place long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325349UCae class=place long=34.8914 lat=32.5026>Caesarea</a>.

Yet did he borrow great sums from others; for he was so very liberal that his expenses exceeded his incomes, and his generosity was boundless. </p>                        </div>

But those freed-men and friends of his, who had the greatest authority with him, dissuaded him from it, and said that it was a dangerous experiment to permit so large a kingdom to come under the government of so very young a man, and one hardly yet arrived at years of discretion, who would not be able to take sufficient care of its administration; while the weight of a kingdom is heavy enough to a grown man. So <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> thought what they said to be reasonable.

When <a href=/people/2617 target=_blank>Fadus</a> was informed of this procedure, it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them. So he seized upon three of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name was <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>; and he banished the other two, Areram and <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>. Tholomy also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>. And indeed, from that time, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> was cleared of robberies by the care and providence of <a href=/people/2617 target=_blank>Fadus</a>. He also at this time sent for the high priests and the principal citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and this at the command of the emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest to wear, in the tower of <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, that it might be under the power of the Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> durst not contradict what he had said, but desired <a href=/people/2617 target=_blank>Fadus</a>, however, and <a href=/people/1477 target=_blank>Longinus</a>, (which last was come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and had brought a great army with him, out of a fear that the [rigid] injunctions of <a href=/people/2617 target=_blank>Fadus</a> should force the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to rebel,) that they might, in the first place, have leave to send ambassadors to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, to petition him that they may have the holy vestments under their own power; and that, in the next place, they would tarry till they knew what answer <a href=/people/299 target=_blank>Claudius</a> would give to that their request. So they replied, that they would give them leave to send their ambassadors, provided they would give them their sons as pledges [for their peaceable behavior].

So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate manner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra; it was a soil that bare amomum in great plenty: there are also in it the remains of that ark, wherein it is related that <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> escaped the deluge, and where they are still shown to such as are desirous to see them. Accordingly, <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> abode in that country until his father's death. But the very day that <a href=/people/3049 target=_blank>Monobazus</a> died, queen <a href=/people/1158 target=_blank>Helena</a> sent for all the grandees, and governors of the kingdom, and for those that had the armies committed to their command; and when they were come, she made the following speech to them: I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> should succeed him in the government, and thought him worthy so to do. However, I wait your determination; for happy is he who receives a kingdom, not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages of a great many. This she said, in order to try those that were invited, and to discover their sentiments. Upon the hearing of which, they first of all paid their homage to the queen, as their custom was, and then they said that they confirmed the king's determination, and would submit to it; and they rejoiced that <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>'s father had preferred him before the rest of his brethren, as being agreeable to all their wishes: but that they were desirous first of all to slay his brethren and kinsmen, that so the government might come securely to <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>; because if they were once destroyed, all that fear would be over which might arise from their hatred and envy to him. <a href=/people/1158 target=_blank>Helena</a> replied to this, that she returned them her thanks for their kindness to herself and to <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>; but desired that they would however defer the execution of this slaughter of <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>'s brethren till he should be there himself, and give his approbation to it. So since these men had not prevailed with her, when they advised her to slay them, they exhorted her at least to keep them in bonds till he should come, and that for their own security; they also gave her counsel to set up some one whom she could put the greatest trust in, as a governor of the kingdom in the mean time. So queen <a href=/people/1158 target=_blank>Helena</a> complied with this counsel of theirs, and set up <a href=/people/3049 target=_blank>Monobazus</a>, the eldest son, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his father's ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which they call Sampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till his brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father was dead, and succeeded his brother <a href=/people/3049 target=_blank>Monobazus</a>, who resigned up the government to him. </p>                        </div>

But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a>. This it was that she said to him, and for the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he had related what she had said to <a href=/people/1530 target=_blank>Ananias</a>, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he went away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action being once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the king's instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time complied with these persuasions of <a href=/people/1530 target=_blank>Ananias</a>. But afterwards, as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jew</a> that came out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a>, whose name was <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, and who was esteemed very skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the thing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him reading the law of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, he said to him, Thou dost not consider, O king! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin thee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now. When the king had heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do. He then sent for his mother, and <a href=/people/1530 target=_blank>Ananias</a> his tutor, and informed them that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion of his so doing. But it was God himself who hindered what they feared from taking effect; for he preserved both <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their faith upon him only.

Whereupon the grandees were much displeased, and could not contain their anger at them; but had an intention, when they should find a proper opportunity, to inflict a punishment upon them. Accordingly, they wrote to Abia, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, and promised him great sums of money, if he would make an expedition against their king; and they further promised him, that, on the first onset, they would desert their king, because they were desirous to punish him, by reason of the hatred he had to their religious worship; then they obliged themselves, by oaths, to be faithful to each other, and desired that he would make haste in this design.

When the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> heard this, he boldly made war upon <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>; and as he had no just pretense for this war, he sent to him, and demanded back those honorable privileges which had been bestowed on him by his father, and threatened, on his refusal, to make war upon him. Upon hearing of this, <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> was under no small trouble of mind, as thinking it would be a reproach upon him to appear to resign those privileges that had been bestowed upon him out of cowardice; yet because he knew, that though the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> should receive back those honors, yet would he not be quiet, he resolved to commit himself to God, his Protector, in the present danger he was in of his life; and as he esteemed him to be his principal assistant, he intrusted his children and his wives to a very strong fortress, and laid up his corn in his citadels, and set the hay and the grass on fire. And when he had thus put things in order, as well as he could, he awaited the coming of the enemy. And when the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> was come, with a great army of footmen and horsemen, which he did sooner than was expected, (for he marched in great haste,) and had cast up a bank at the river that parted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360440RAdi class=place long=44 lat=36>Adiabene</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, — <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> also pitched his camp not far off, having with him six thousand horsemen. But there came a messenger to <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a>, sent by the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, who told him how large his dominions were, as reaching from the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=place long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactria</a>, and enumerated that king's subjects; he also threatened him that he should be punished, as a person ungrateful to his lords; and said that the God whom he worshipped could not deliver him out of the king's hands. When the messenger had delivered this his message, <a href=/people/1313 target=_blank>Izates</a> replied that he knew the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>'s power was much greater than his own; but that he knew also that God was much more powerful than all men. And when he had returned him this answer, he betook himself to make supplication to God, and threw himself upon the ground, and put ashes upon his head, in testimony of his confusion, and fasted, together with his wives and children. Then he called upon God, and said, O Lord and Governor, if I have not in vain committed myself to thy goodness, but have justly determined that thou only art the Lord and principal of all beings, come now to my assistance, and defend me from my enemies, not only on my own account, but on account of their insolent behavior with regard to thy power, while they have not feared to lift up their proud and arrogant tongue against thee. Thus did he lament and bemoan himself, with tears in his eyes; whereupon God heard his prayer. And immediately that very night <a href=/people/2358 target=_blank>Vologases</a> received letters, the contents of which were these, that a great band of Dahe and Sacse, despising him, now he was gone so long a journey from home, had made an expedition, and laid <a href=/people/3928 target=_blank>Parthis</a> waste; so that he [was forced to] retire back, without doing any thing.

When that feast which is called the passover was at hand, at which time our custom is to use unleavened bread, and a great multitude was gathered together from all parts to that feast, <a href=/people/2861 target=_blank>Cumanus</a> was afraid lest some attempt of innovation should then be made by them; so he ordered that one regiment of the army should take their arms, and stand in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> cloisters, to repress any attempts of innovation, if perchance any such should begin; and this was no more than what the former procurators of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> did at such festivals. But on the fourth day of the feast, a certain soldier let down his breeches, and exposed his privy members to the multitude, which put those that saw him into a furious rage, and made them cry out that this impious action was not done to approach them, but God himself; nay, some of them reproached <a href=/people/2861 target=_blank>Cumanus</a>, and pretended that the soldier was set on by him, which, when <a href=/people/2861 target=_blank>Cumanus</a> heard, he was also himself not a little provoked at such reproaches laid upon him; yet did he exhort them to leave off such seditious attempts, and not to raise a tumult at the festival. But when he could not induce them to be quiet for they still went on in their reproaches to him, he gave order that the whole army should take their entire armor, and come to <a href=/people/1215 target=_blank>Antonia</a>, which was a fortress, as we have said already, which overlooked the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>; but when the multitude saw the soldiers there, they were affrighted at them, and ran away hastily; but as the passages out were but narrow, and as they thought their enemies followed them, they were crowded together in their flight, and a great number were pressed to death in those narrow passages; nor indeed was the number fewer than twenty thousand that perished in this tumult. So instead of a festival, they had at last a mournful day of it; and they all of them forgot their prayers and sacrifices, and betook themselves to lamentation and weeping; so great an affliction did the impudent obsceneness of a single soldier bring upon them. </p>                        </div>

Yet did <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> catch and put to death many of those impostors every day, together with the robbers. He also caught <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, the son of Dineas, who had gotten together a company of robbers; and this he did by treachery; for he gave him assurance that he should suffer no harm, and thereby persuaded him to come to him; but when he came, he bound him, and sent him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> also bore an ill-will to <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, the high priest, because he frequently gave him admonitions about governing the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> affairs better than he did, lest he should himself have complaints made of him by the multitude, since he it was who had desired <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to send him as procurator of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>. So <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> contrived a method whereby he might get rid of him, now he was become so continually troublesome to him; for such continual admonitions are grievous to those who are disposed to act unjustly. Wherefore <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> persuaded one of <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>'s most faithful friends, a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, whose name was <a href=/people/9285 target=_blank>Doras</a>, to bring the robbers upon <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a>, in order to kill him; and this he did by promising to give him a great deal of money for so doing. <a href=/people/9285 target=_blank>Doras</a> complied with the proposal, and contrived matters so, that the robbers might murder him after the following manner: Certain of those robbers went up to the city, as if they were going to worship God, while they had daggers under their garments, and by thus mingling themselves among the multitude they slew <a href=/people/270 target=_blank>Jonathan</a> and as this murder was never avenged, the robbers went up with the greatest security at the festivals after this time; and having weapons concealed in like manner as before, and mingling themselves among the multitude, they slew certain of their own enemies, and were subservient to other men for money; and slew others, not only in remote parts of the city, but in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> itself also; for they had the boldness to murder men there, without thinking of the impiety of which they were guilty.

But the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> citizens depending on their wealth, and on that account despising the Syrians, reproached them again, and hoped to provoke them by such reproaches.

Now those <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> that were more moderate, and of principal dignity among them, were afraid of themselves, and desired of <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> that he would sound a retreat to his soldiers, and spare them for the future, and afford them room for repentance for what they had done; and <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a> was prevailed upon to do so. </p>                        </div>

In the first place, therefore, history informs us that <a href=/people/4040 target=_blank>Aaron</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, officiated to God as a high priest, and that, after his death, his sons succeeded him immediately; and that this dignity hath been continued down from them all to their posterity. Whence it is a custom of our country, that no one should take the high priesthood of God but he who is of the blood of <a href=/people/4040 target=_blank>Aaron</a>, while every one that is of another stock, though he were a king, can never obtain that high priesthood. Accordingly, the number of all the high priests from <a href=/people/4040 target=_blank>Aaron</a>, of whom we have spoken already, as of the first of them, until <a href=/people/6792 target=_blank>Phanas</a>, who was made high priest during the war by the seditious, was eighty-three; of whom thirteen officiated as high priests in the wilderness, from the days of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, while the tabernacle was standing, until the people came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, when king <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> erected the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> to God; for at the first they held the high priesthood till the end of their life, although afterward they had successors while they were alive. Now these thirteen, who were the descendants of two of the sons of <a href=/people/4040 target=_blank>Aaron</a>, received this dignity by succession, one after another; for their form of government was an aristocracy, and after that a monarchy, and in the third place the government was regal Now the number of years during the rule of these thirteen, from the day when our fathers departed out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, under <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> their leader, until the building of that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> which king <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> erected at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, were six hundred and twelve. </p>                        </div>

But they give him the testimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted with our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning; on which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains. </p>                        </div>
