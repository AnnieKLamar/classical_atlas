Before the harbor lies the so-called Mountain Island, about two hundred stadia sea-ward from the very head of the bay, with the shores of the mainland close to it on both sides. Ships bound for this port now anchor here because of attacks from the land. They used formerly to anchor at the very head of the bay, by an island called <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>, close to the shore, which could be reached on foot from the land; by which means the barbarous natives attacked the island.
