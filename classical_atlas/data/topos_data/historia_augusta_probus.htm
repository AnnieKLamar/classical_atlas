It means that <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, an emperor whose rule restored to perfect safety the east, the west, the south, and the north, indeed all parts of the world, is now, by reason of a lack of writers, almost unknown to us. 4 Perished — shame be upon us! — has the story of a man so great and such as is not to be found either in the Punic Wars or in the Gallic terror, not in the commotions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a> or the wiles of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=person long=-4 lat=39>Spaniard</a>. 5 But I will not permit myself — I who at first sought out <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> alone, relating the story of his life to the best of my powers, and have since written of <a href=/people/3256 target=_blank>Tacitus</a> and <a href=/people/11058 target=_blank>Florian</a> also — to fail to rise to the deeds of <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, purposing, should the length of my life suffice, to tell of all who remain as far as <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a> and <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a>. 6 No fluency or elegance of style can I promise, but only the record of their deeds, which I will not suffer to die. </p>                        </div>

Both as commoner and as emperor he stood forth illustrious, famed for his virtues. 2 His father, so some have said in their writings, was a man named <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, who, after commanding in the ranks with honour and winning a tribuneship, died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, leaving a wife, a son, and a daughter. 3 Many aver that <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> was a relative of <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, that most excellent and venerated prince, but this, because it has been stated by only one of the Greek writers, we shall leave undiscussed. 4 This one thing I will say, however, which I remember reading in the journal, namely, that <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> was buried by a sister named <a href=/people/1822 target=_blank>Claudia</a>. 5 As a youth <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> became so famed for his bodily strength that by approval of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> he received a tribuneship almost before his beard was grown. 6 There is still in existence a letter written by <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> to <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, in which he praises <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, then still a youth, and holds him up for all to imitate. 7 From this it is clear that no man has ever in his maturity attained to the sum of the virtues except one who, trained in the nobler nursery of the virtues, had as a boy given some sign of distinction. </p>                        </div>

Following out the opinion which I have always held concerning <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> from his early youth, as well as that held by all good men, who say that he is a man worthy of his name, I have appointed him to a tribuneship, assigning six cohorts of <a href=/people/11026 target=_blank>Saracens</a> and entrusting to him, besides, the Gallic irregulars along with that company of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> which Artabassis the Syrian delivered over to us. 2 Now I beg of you, my dearest son, to hold this young man, whom I wish all the lads to imitate, in the high honour that his virtues and his services call for in view of what is owed him by reason of the brilliance of his mind. <br />3 Another letter about him, written to the prefect of the guard with an order for rations: <br />From <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> Augustus to Mulvius Gallicanus, prefect of the guard. You may perhaps wonder why it is that contrary to the ruling of the Deified <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a> I have appointed as tribune a beardless youth. You will not, however, wonder much if you consider <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>; 4 he is a young man of probity indeed. For never, when I consider him myself, does aught suggest itself to me but his name, which, were it not his name already, he might well receive as a surname. 5 Therefore, since his fortune is but a modest one, that his rank may be enhanced by an additional remuneration, you will order him to be supplied with two red tunics, two Gallic cloaks provided with clasps, two under-tunics with bands of embroidery, a silver platter, polished to reflect the light, to weigh ten pounds, one hundred aurei of <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, one thousand silver pieces of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>, and ten thousand copper coins of <a href=/people/12098 target=_blank>Philip</a>; 6 likewise for his daily rations, . . . pounds of beef, six pounds of pork, ten pounds of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>'s meat, one fowl every second day, one pint of oil every second day, ten pints of old wine every day, and a sufficient quantity of bacon, biscuit, cheap wine, salt, greens, and firewood. 7 You will order, furthermore, that quarters be assigned to him as they are to the tribunes of the legions. </p>                        </div>

Let <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>' letter be set aside. What will you say to the judgement of <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a>? For he handed over to <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> the soldiers of the Tenth Legion, the bravest of his army, with whom he himself had done mighty deeds, giving him the following testimonial: <br />6 From <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> Augustus to <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, greetings. In order that you may know how much I think of you, take the command of my Tenth Legion, which <a href=/people/11041 target=_blank>Claudius</a> entrusted to me. For these are soldiers who know as commanders none but those destined to be emperors — an assurance, as it were, of favourable fortune. <br />7 From this it was seen that <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> had in mind, in case anything serious befell him, which he well knew was to be such, was to make <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> emperor. </p>                        </div>

I may not refuse an office which is most distasteful to me. 7 I must play the part which the soldiers have assigned me. I beg of you, <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a>, as you hope to enjoy with me the state in safety, to supply the soldiers everywhere with grain and provisions and all necessities.

Wherefore, I will add only that which, most of all, hastened on for this great man his destined doom. 2 When he had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a>, desiring to enrich and enlarge his native place, he set many thousand soldiers together to draining a certain marsh, planning a great canal with outlets flowing into the Save, and thus draining a region for the use of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450196USir class=place long=19.6102 lat=44.9666>Sirmium</a>. 3 At this the soldiers rebelled, and pursuing him as he fled to an iron-clad tower, which he himself had reared to a very great height to serve as a look-out, they slew him there in the fifth year of his reign. 4 Afterwards, however, all the soldiers together built him a mighty tomb on a lofty mound, with an inscription carved on marble as follows: Here lies <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a>, the Emperor, a man of probity indeed, the conqueror of all barbarian nations, the conqueror, too, of pretenders. </p>                        </div>

For from his training came <a href=/people/3552 target=_blank>Carus</a>, <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a>, <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a>, <a href=/people/1585 target=_blank>Asclepiodotus</a>, Hannibalianus, <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a>, Cecropius, Pisonianus, <a href=/people/11066 target=_blank>Herennianus</a>, Gaudiosus, Ursinianus, and all the others whom our fathers admired and from whom many good princes arose. 4 Let him now, who will, compare the twenty years of <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a> or <a href=/people/1020 target=_blank>Hadrian</a>, let him compare the years of the Antonines, nearly equal in number. For why should I mention Augustus, the years of whose reign all but exceeded the life of a man? Of the evil princes, moreover, I will keep silent. That most famous remark of <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> itself reveals what he hoped to have brought about, for he said that soon there would be no need of soldiers. </p>                        </div>

That throng of fighting-men, which now harries the commonwealth with civil wars, would be at the plough, would be busy with study, or learning the arts, or sailing the seas. Add to this, too, that none would be slain in war. 4 O ye gracious gods, what mighty offence in your eyes has the Roman commonwealth committed, that ye should have taken from it so noble a prince? 5 Now away with those who make ready soldiers for civil strife, who arm the hands of brothers to slay their brothers, who call on sons to wound their fathers, and who deny to <a href=/people/879 target=_blank>Probus</a> the divinity which our emperors have wisely deemed should be immortalised by likenesses, honoured by temples, and celebrated by spectacles in the circus! </p>                        </div>
