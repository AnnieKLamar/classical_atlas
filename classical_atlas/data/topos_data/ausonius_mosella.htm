Thence onward I began a lonely journey through pathless forest, nor did my eyes rest on any trace of human inhabitants. I passed Dumnissus, sweltering amid its parched fields, and <a href=/people/10339 target=_blank>Tabernae</a>, watered by its unfailing spring, and the lands lately parcelled out to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=demonym long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatian</a> settlers. And at length on the very verge of Belgic territory I descry Noiomagus, the famed camp of sainted <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>. Clearer the air which here invests the plains, and <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, cloudless now, discloses glowing heaven with his untroubled light. No longer is the sky to seek, shut out by the green gloom of branches intertwined: but the free breath of transparent day withholds not sight of the sun's pure rays and of the aether, dazzling to the eyes. Nay more, the whole gracious prospect made me behold a picture of my own native land, the smiling and well-tended country of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/448000UBur class=place long=-0.5792 lat=44.8378>Burdigala</a>, the roofs of country-houses, perched high upon the overhanging river-banks, the hill-sides green with vines, and the pleasant stream of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/497066WMos class=place long=6.6265 lat=49.7338>Moselle</a> gliding below with subdued murmuring.</p>                        </div>

Thou, with calm waters onward gliding, feel'st not any murmurs of the wind nor check from hidden rocks; nor by foaming shallows art thou forced to hurry on in swirling rapids, no eyots hast thou jutting in midstream to thwart thy course lest the glory of thy due title be impaired, if any isle sunder and stem thy flow. For thee two modes of voyaging are appointed: this, when boats move down thy stream with current favouring and their oars thrash the churned waters at full speed, that, when along the banks, with tow-rope never slackening, the boatmen strain on their shoulders hawsers bound to the masts. Thyself how often dost thou marvel at the windings of thine own stream, and think its natural speed moves almost too slowly! Thou with no mud-grown sedge fringest thy banks, nor with foul ooze o'er-spread'st thy marge; dry is the treading down to thy water's edge.</p>                        </div>

All unsuspecting, the wandering finny tribe rush upon them agape; and when too late! their opened gullets feel the concealed barbs pierce deep within, they struggle, and their struggles are betrayed above, when the wand bends in response to the tremulous vibrations of the quivering line. Straightway the boy skilfully whisks his prey from the water, swinging it sidelong with a whistling stroke: a hissing follows on the blow, even as the breeze whines and whistles when sometimes a scourge is whirled through empty space and disturbs the air. The dripping catch flounders on the parched rocks and quakes at the deadly shafts of light-bringing day. Beneath his native waters, his strength endured: enfeebled by our atmosphere his life wastes away in the air he gasps. Now his weakening body quivers with feeble beats, now his nerveless tail endures its last throbs: his gaping mouth no longer closes: his panting gills give back the air they have drained and blow forth the death-dealing breath of day. Even so, when the blast fans a smithy-fire, the valve of wool which plays in the hollow of the beechen bellows alternately sucks in and confines the winds now by this hole, now by that. I myself have seen fish, already quivering in the throes of death, summon up their last gasp and, leaping high into the air, cast themselves with a somersault into the river beneath, gaining once more the waters which they never looked to find again.

Though they might prolong their courses,, yet they haste to lose their names in thee. For, albeit swelled by the waters of Promea and Nemesa, Sura, no weakling stream, hurries to plunge beneath thy waves — Sura, who delights thee with the affluents she has cut off, and who enjoys ampler renown when wholly merged in thee and bearing thy name than if she blended with Father Ocean an outfall unworthy fame. Thee swift Celbis, thee Erubris, famed for marble, hasten full eagerly to approach with their attendant waters: renowned is Celbis for glorious fish, and that other, as he turns his mill-stones in furious revolutions and drives the shrieking saws through smooth blocks of marble, hears from either bank a ceaseless din. I pass by feeble Lesura and scanty Drahonus, nor turn to use Salmona's despised rivulet: long has Saravus, bearing ships upon the volume of his sounding waves, been calling me with all his robe outspread: far has he prolonged his stream that he might roll his wearied outfall beneath imperial walls. No whit beneath him is blest Alisontia who laps fruit-laden banks as he glides silently through rich corn-lands. A thousand others, according to the vehemence of each which drives him on, long to become thine: such is the ambition of these hurrying streams or such their character. But if to thee, O divine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/497066WMos class=place long=6.6265 lat=49.7338>Moselle</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Smyrna</a> or famed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/452108UMan class=place long=10.7975 lat=45.1608>Mantua</a> had given its own poet, then would <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSim class=place long=26.248 lat=39.9617>Simois</a>, renowned on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>'s coasts, yield place, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> would not dare to set his glories above thine.
