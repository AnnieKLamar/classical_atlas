For one who wishes a clever theory, the invention of painting belongs to the gods — witness on earth all the designs with which the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Seasons</a> paint the meadows, and the manifestations we see in the heavens — but for one who is merely seeking the origin of art, imitation is an invention most ancient and most akin to nature; and wise men invented it, calling it now painting, now plastic art. </p>                        </div>

For it both reproduces light and shade and also permits the observer to recognize the look, now of the man who is mad, now of the man who is sorrowing or rejoicing. The varying nature of bright eyes the plastic artist does not bring out at all in his work; but the grey eye, the blue eye, and black eye are known to painting; and it knows chestnut and red and yellow hair, and the colour of garments and of armour, chambers too and houses and groves and mountains and springs and the air that envelops them all. </p>                        </div>

And as I did not wish to deliver my addresses in public, the young men kept coming to the house of my host and importuning me. I was lodging outside the walls in a suburb facing the sea, where there was a portico built on four, I think, or possibly five terraces, open to the west wind and looking out on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409115WTyr class=place long=11.5 lat=40.9>Tyrrhenian sea</a>. It was resplendent with all the marbles favoured by luxury, but it was particularly splendid by reason of the panel-paintings set in the walls, paintings which I though had been collected with real judgment, for they exhibited the skill of very many painters. The idea had already occurred to me that I ought to speak in praise of the paintings, when the son of my host, quite a young boy, only ten years old but already an ardent listener and eager to learn, kept watching me as I went from one to another and asking me to interpret them. So in order that he might not think me ill-bred, Very well, I said, we will make them the subject of a discourse as soon as the young men come. And when they came, I said, Let me put the boy in front and address to him my effort at interpretation; but do you follow, not only agreeing but also asking questions if anything I say is not clear. </p>                        </div>

Well then, let us try to get at the meaning of it. Turn your eyes away from the painting itself so as to look only at the events on which it is based. Surely you are familiar with the passage in the <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> where <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> makes <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> rise up to avenge <a href=/people/137 target=_blank>Patroclus</a>, and the gods are moved to make battle with each other. Now of this battle of the gods the painting ignores all the rest, but it tells how <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> fell upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262WSka class=place long=26.213 lat=39.994>Scamander</a> with might and main. Now look again at the painting; it is all from <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. Here is the lofty citadel, and here the battlements of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>; here is the great plain, large enough for marshalling the forces of Asia against the forces of Europe; here fire rolls mightily like a flood over the plain and mightily it creeps along the banks of the River so that no trees are left there. The fire which envelops <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> flows out on the surface of the water and the River is suffering and in person begs <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> for mercy. But the River is not painted with long hair, for the hair has been burnt off; nor is <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> painted as lame, for he is running; and the flames of the fire are not ruddy nor yet of the usual appearance, but they shine like gold and sunbeams. In this <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> is no longer followed. </p>                        </div>

Yet night is not represented as a person, but rather it is suggested by what is going on; and the splendid entrance indicates a very wealthy pair just married who are lying on a couch. And Comus has come, a youth to join the youths, delicate and yet full grown, flushed with wine and, though erect, he is asleep under the influence of drink. As he sleeps the face falls forward on the breast so that the throat is not visible, and he holds his left hand up to his ear. The hand itself, which has apparently grasped the ear, is relaxed and limp, as is usual at the beginning of slumber, when sleep gently invites us and the mind passes over into forgetfulness of its thoughts; and for the same reason the torch seems to be falling from his right hand as sleep relaxes it. And for fear lest the flames of the torch come too near his leg, Comus bends his lower left leg over towards the right and holds the torch out on his left side, keeping his right hand at a distance by means of the projecting knee in order that he may avoid the breath of the torch. </p>                        </div>

The moral, I think, is that persons of his age should not go revelling, except with heads veiled. The rest of the body is sharply defined, for the torch shines on every part of it and brings it into the light. The crown of roses should be praised, not much for its truth of representation — since it is no difficult achievement, for instance with yellow and dark blue pigments, to imitate the semblance of flowers — but one must praise the tender and delicate quality of the crown. I praise, too, the dewy look of the roses, and assert that they are painted fragrance and all. </p>                        </div>

Do you not hear the castanets and the flute's shrill note and the disorderly singing? The torches give a faint light, enough for the revellers to see what is close in front of them, but not enough for us to see them. Peals of laughter rise, and women rush along with men, wearing men's sandals and garments girt in strange fashion; for the revel permits women to masquerade as men, and men to put on women's garb and to ape the walk of women. Their crowns are no longer fresh but, crushed down on the head on account of the wild running of the dancers, they have lost their joyous look; for the free spirit of the flowers deprecates the touch of the hand as causing them to wither before their time. The painting also represents in a way the din which the revel most requires; the right hand with bent fingers strikes the hollowed palm of the left hand, in order that the hands beaten like cymbals may resound in unison. </p>                        </div>

For while <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> also cared for fable, and <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, and <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> too in his verses to <a href=/people/5093 target=_blank>Lycambes</a>, <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> has treated all sides of human life in his fables, and has made his animals speak in order to point a moral. For he checks greed and rebukes insolence and deceit, and in all this some animal is his mouthpiece — a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> or a <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and not even the tortoise is dumb — that through them children may learn the business of life. So the Fables, honoured because of <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, gather at the doors of the wise man to bind fillets about his head and to crown him with a victor's crown of wild olive. And <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, methinks, is weaving some fable; at any rate his smile and his eyes fixed on the ground indicate this. The painter knows that for the composition of fables relaxation of the spirit is needed. And the painting is clever in representing the persons of the Fables. For it combines animals with men to make a chorus about <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>, composed of the actors in his fables; and the <a href=/people/10958 target=_blank>fox</a> is painted as leader of the chorus, wince <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a> uses him as a slave in developing most of his themes, as comedy uses Daos [wise slave in Menander]. </p>                        </div>

For here are four of them, the most beautiful of all, withdrawn from the rest; two of them are throwing an apple back and forth, and the second pair are engaged in archery, one shooting at his companion and the latter shooting back. Nor is there any trace of hostility in their faces; rather they offer their breasts to each other, in order that the missiles may pierce them there, no doubt. It is a beautiful riddle; come, let us see if perchance I can guess the painter's meaning. This is friendship, my boy, and yearning of one for the other. For the Cupids who play ball with the apple are beginning to fall in love, and so the one kisses the apple before he throws it, and the other holds out his hands to catch it, evidently intending to kiss it in his turn if he catches it and then to throw it back; but the pair of archers are confirming a love that is already present.

The place is encompassed by mountains heaven high, not all of one type; for some that are covered with pine trees suggest a light soil, others luxuriant with cypress trees proclaim that their soil is of clay, and yonder fir trees — what else do they mean than that the mountain is storm-swept and rugged? For firs do not like rich soil nor do they care for warmth; accordingly their place is at a distance from the plains, since they grow more readily in the mountains because of the wind. And springs are breaking forth from the mountain sides; as they flow down and mingle their waters below, the plain becomes a marsh; not, however, a disordered marsh or the kind that is befouled with mud; but the course of its waters is directed in the painting just as if nature, wise in all things, directed it, and the stream winds in many a tortuous meander, abounding in parsley and suited for the voyaging of water-fowl. For you see the ducks, I am sure, how they glide along the water-course blowing jets of water from their bills. And what of the tribe of geese? Indeed, they too are painted in accordance with their nature, as resting on the water and sailing on it. And those long-legged birds with huge beaks, you doubtless recognize as foreign, the birds delicately coloured each with different plumage. Their attitudes also are various; one stands on a rock resting first one foot and then the other, one dries its feathers, one preens them, another has snatched some prey from the water, and yet another has bent its head to the land so as to feed on something there. </p>                        </div>

Here indeed is the most beautiful water of the marsh, issuing direct from a spring, and it forms a swimming-pool of exceeding beauty. In the midst of the pool amaranth flowers are nodding this way and that, sweet clusters that pelt the water with their blossoms. It is among these clusters that the Cupids are riding sacred birds with golden bridles, one giving free rein, another drawing in, another turning, another driving around the goal-post. Just imagine that you hear them urging on their swans, and threatening and jeering at one another — for this is all to be seen in their faces. One is trying to give his neighbour a fall, another has done it, still another is glad enough to have fallen from his bird that he may take a bath in the race-course. On the banks round about stand more musical swans, singing the <a href=/people/3222 target=_blank>Orthian</a> strain, I think, as befits the contestants. The winged youth you see is an indication that a song is being sung, for he is the wind <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyrus</a> and he gives the swans the keynote of their song.

Wherein, then lies its cleverness? The painter has thrown a bridge of date palms across the river, and there is a very pretty reason for this; for knowing that palms are said to be male and female, and having heard about their marriage, that the male trees take their brides by bending over towards the female trees and embracing them with their branches, he has painted a palm of one sex on one bank and one of the other sex on the other bank. Thereupon the male tree falls in love and bends over and stretches out over the river; and since it is unable to reach the female tree, which is still at a distance, it lies prone and renders menial service by bridging the water, and it is a safe bridge for men to cross on because of the roughness of its bark. </p>                        </div>

The horns, you observe, are black and jagged and formidable for attack. All the wood required for the lyre is of boxwood, firm and free from knots — there is no ivory anywhere about the lyre, for men did not yet know either the elephant or the use they were to make of its tusks. The tortoise-shell is black, but its portrayal is accurate and true to nature in that the surface is covered with irregular circles which touch each other and have yellow eyes; and the lower ends of the strings below the bridge lie close to the shell and are attached to knobs, while between the bridge and the crossbar the strings seem to be without support, this arrangement of the strings being apparently best adapted for keeping them stretched taut on the lyre. </p>                        </div>

No doubt he is singing a hymn to <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> because she, creator and mother of all things, is giving him his walls, which already are rising of their own accord. His hair is lovely and truthfully depicted, falling as it does in disorder on his forehead and mingling with the downy beard beside the ear, and showing a glint of gold; but it is lovelier still where it is held by the headband — the headband wrought by the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a>, a most lovely ornament, as the poets of the Secret Verses say — and quite in keeping with the lyre. My own opinion is that <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> gave <a href=/people/393 target=_blank>Amphion</a> both these gifts, both the lyre and the headband, because he was overcome by love for him.

His left hand is playing, too, with fingers extended straight, a conception which I should have thought only plastic art would venture. Well, how about the stones? They all run together toward the singing, they listen, and they become a wall. At one point the wall is finished, at another it is rising, at still another the foundation is just laid.

This one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411291WBos class=place long=29.0753 lat=41.1194>Bosphorus</a> has been studied enough for me. What do you mean? I have yet to speak of the fishermen, as I promised when I began. Not to dilate on small matters, but only on points worth discussing, let us omit any account of those who fish with a rod or use a basket cunningly or perchance draw up a net or thrust a trident — for you will hear little about such, and they will seem to you mere embellishments of the painting — but let us look at the men who are trying to capture <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>-fish, for these are worth discussing because the hunt is on so large a scale. For <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>tunny</a>-fish come to the outer sea from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a>, where they are born and where they feed on fish and sediment and vegetable matter which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a> bring to it, rivers which make the water of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Euxine</a> sweeter and more drinkable than that of any other sea. And they swim like a phalanx of soldiers, eight rows deep and sixteen and twice sixteen, and they drop down in the water, one swimming over another so that the depth of the school equals the width. Now the ways of catching them are countless; sharp iron spears may be used on them or drugs may be sprinkled over them, or a small net is enough for a fisherman who is satisfied with some small portion of the school. But the best means of taking them is this: a look-out is stationed on a high tree, a man quick at counting and keen of vision. For it is his task to fix his eyes on the sea and to look as far as he can; and if perchance he sees the fish approaching, then he must shout as loud as he can to those in the boats and must tell the number of the fish, how many thousands there are; and the boatmen compassing them about with a deep-laid net that can be drawn together make a splendid catch, enough to enrich the captain of the hunt. </p>                        </div>

The group of fishermen is charming, and they are brown of complexion from exposure to the sun. One binds his oar in its place, another rows with swelling muscle, another cheers his neighbour on, another strikes a man who is not rowing.

Of the Cupids, my boy, those are visible who turn the drill, and those by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> that smooth with the adze portions of the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> which are not yet accurately finished, and those that measure off the symmetrical proportions on which craftsmanship depends. But the Cupids that work with the saw surpass all conception and all skill in drawing and colour. For look! The saw has attacked the wood and is already passing through it, and these Cupids keep it going, one on the ground, another on the staging, both straightening up and bending forward in turn. Let us consider this movement to be alternate; one has bent low as if about to rise up, his companion has risen erect as if about to bend over; the one on the ground draws his breath into his chest, and the one who is aloft fills his lungs down to his belly as he presses both hands down on the saw. </p>                        </div>

If it is beauty you are investigating, pay no heed to the water; for we are more competent than it to tell all your charms. Your eye is bright, and many a provoking glance comes from it to the flute; your brow overarching the eye indicates the meaning of the tune you play; your cheek seems to quiver and as it were to dance to the melody; your breath does not puff out your cheeks because it is all in the flute; your hair is not unkempt, nor does it lie smooth, made sleek with unguents as in a city youth, but it is so dry that it is fluffy, yet without giving the impression of squalid dryness by reason of the bright fresh sprays of pine upon it. Beautiful is such a crown and well adapted to adorn beautiful youths; but let flowers grow for maidens and let them produce their rosy colour for women. Your breast, I should say, is filled not merely with breath for the flute, but also with thoughts of music and meditation on the tunes you will play. As far as the breast the water pictures you, as you bend down over it from the rock; but if it pictured you full length, it would not have shown you as comely from the breast down; for reflections in the water are but on the surface, imperfect because stature is foreshortened in them. The fact that your reflection is broken by ripples may be due to your flute breathing upon the water of the fountain, or all that we see may be due to <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyrus</a>, who inspires you in playing the flute, the flute in breathing its strain, and the spring in being moved by the flute-playing. </p>                        </div>

A youth just returned from the hunt stands over a pool, drawing from within himself a kind of yearning and falling in love with his own beauty; and, as you see, he sheds a radiance into the water.

For the statues are of a crude art and made from a local stone; some of them are worn away by time, others have been mutilated by children of cowherds or shepherds while still young and unaware of the presence of the god. Nor is the pool without some connection with the Bacchic rites of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, since he had made it known to the <a href=/people/159 target=_blank>Nymphs</a> of the wine-press; at any rate it is roofed over with vine and ivy and beautiful creeping plants, and it abounds in clusters of grapes and the trees that furnish the thyrsi, and tuneful birds disport themselves above it, each with its own note, and white flowers grow about the pool, not yet in blossom but just springing up in honour of the youth. The painting has such regard for realism that it even shows drops of dew dripping from the flowers and a <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> settling on the flowers — whether a real <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> has been deceived by the painted flowers of whether we are to be deceived into thinking that a painted <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> is real, I do not know. But let that pass. As for you, however, <a href=/people/10943 target=_blank>Narcissus</a>, it is no painting that has deceived you, nor are you engrossed in a thing of pigments or wax; but you do not realize that the water represents you exactly as you are when you gaze upon it, nor do you see through the artifice of the pool, though to do so you have only to nod your head or change your expression or slightly move your hand, instead of standing in the same attitude; but acting as though you had met a companion, you wait for some move on his part. Do you then expect the pool to enter into conversation with you? Nay, this youth does not hear anything we say, but he is immersed eyes and ears alike, in the water and we must interpret the painting for ourselves. </p>                        </div>

The arm shows an open space at the point where the elbow bends, a wrinkle where the wrist is twisted, and it casts a shadow as it ends in the palm of the hand, and the lines of the shadow are slanting because the fingers are bent in. Whether the panting of his breast remains from his hunting or is already the painting of love I do not know. The eye, surely, is that of a man deeply in love, for its natural brightness and intensity are softened by a longing that settles upon it, and he perhaps thinks that he is loved in return, since the reflection gazes at him in just the way that he looks at it. There would be much to say about the hair if we found him while hunting. For there are innumerable tossings of the hair in running, especially when it is blown by a wind; but even as it is the subject should not be passed over in silence. For it is very abundant and of a golden hue; and some it clings to the neck, some is parted by the ears, some tumbles over the forehead, and some falls in ripples to the beard. Both the Narcissi are exactly alike in form and each repeats the traits of the other, except that one stands out in the open air while the other is immersed in the pool.

Let no the meadow delay you with the flower, for it grows here also, not different from the flower which springs from the earth. The painting tells us that the hair of the youth is hyacinthine, and that his blood, taking on life in the earth, has given the flower its own crimson colour.

One shows in his face a touch of the palaestra, anther shows grace, another urbanity, and the fourth, you will say, has just raised his head from a book. The <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> they ride are no two alike, white and chestnut and black and bay, <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with silver bits, dappled <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with golden trappings — these pigments, it is said, the barbarians living by <a href=/people/527 target=_blank>Oceanus</a> compound of red-hot bronze, and they combine, and grow hard, and preserve what is painted with them — nor have the youths the same clothing or equipment. One lightly armed horseman wears his tunic girt up, a good javelin thrower I suppose, another has his breast protected with armour, threatening fight with the wild beast, another has his shins protected, another his legs. That youth rides on a white <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> which, as you see, has a black head, and a white medallion is fashioned on his forehead in imitation of the full moon; and it has golden trappings, and bridle of <a href=/people/538 target=_blank>Median</a> scarlet; for his colour flashes on the gold with the effect of fiery-red jewels. The youth's garment is a chlamys bellying out in the wind; in colour it is the sea-purple which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a> love, and it should be prized above other purple dyes; for though it seems to be dark it gains a peculiar beauty from the sun and is infused with the brilliancy of the sun's warmth. And from shame of exposing himself unclad to those about him he wears a sleeved chiton of purple which reaches half-way down his thighs and likewise half-way to his elbows. He smiles, and his eye flashes, and he wears his hair long, but not long enough to shade his eyes when the wind shall throw it into disorder. Doubtless many a one will praise his cheeks and the proportions of his nose and each several feature of his face, but I admire his spiritedness; for as a hunter he is vigorous and is proud of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and he is conscious of the fact that he is beloved. Mules and a muleteer bring their luggage, snares and nets and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>-spears and javelins and lances with toothed blades; masters of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> accompany the expedition and trackers and all breeds of <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, not alone the keen-scented and swift of foot, but also the high-spirited <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>, for courage also was required to confront the wild beast.

And of the exploit which I think the man undertook voluntarily for love, my boy, you must have heard — the exploit of <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> who, they say, slew in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> a monster from the sea of <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a>, which was making its way against herds and the people of this land. Now the painter glorifies this tale and shows his pity for <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> in that she was given over to the monster. The contest is already finished and the monster lies stretched out on the strand, weltering in streams of blood — the reason the sea is red — while <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> frees <a href=/people/691 target=_blank>Andromeda</a> from her bonds. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> is painted with wings as usual, but here, as it not usual, he is a young man, panting and still showing the effects of his toil; for before the deed <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> put up a prayer to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> that he should come and with him swoop down upon the creature, and <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> came, for he heard the Greek's prayer. The maiden is charming in that she is fair of skin though in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and charming is the very beauty of her form; she would surpass a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> girl in daintiness, an Attic girl in stateliness, a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=demonym long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartan</a> in sturdiness. Her beauty is enhanced by the circumstances of the moment; for she seems to be incredulous, her joy is mingled with fear, and as she gazes at <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> she begins to send a smile towards him. He, not far from the maiden, lies in the sweet fragrant grass, dripping sweat on the ground and keeping the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s head hidden lest people see it and be turned to stone. Many <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a>-herds come offering him milk and wine to drink, charming <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a> with their strange colouring and their grim smiles; and they show that they are pleased, and most of them look alike, <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> welcomes their gifts and, supporting himself on his left elbow, he lefts his chest, filled with breath through panting, and keeps his gaze upon the maiden, and lets the wind blow out his chlamys, which is purple and spattered with drops of blood and with the flecks which the creature breathed upon it in the struggle. Let the children of <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> perish when it comes to a comparison with the shoulder of <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>! for beautiful as he is and ruddy of face, his bloom has been enhanced by his toil and his veins are swollen, as is wont to happen when the breath comes quickly. Much gratitude does he win from the maiden. </p>                        </div>

Purple figs dripping with juice are heaped on vine-leaves; and they are depicted with breaks in the skin, some just cracking open to disgorge their honey, some split apart, they are so ripe. Near them lies a branch, not bare, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, or empty of fruit, but under the shade of its leaves are figs, some still green and untimely, some with wrinkled skin over-ripe, and some about to turn, disclosing the shining juice, while on the tip of the branch a sparrow buries its bill in what seems the very sweetest of the figs. All the ground is strewn with chestnuts, some of which are rubbed free of the burr, others lie quite shut up, and others how the burr breaking at the lines of division. See, too, the pears on pears, apples on apples, both heaps of them and piles of ten, all fragrant and golden. You will say that their redness has not been put on from outside, but has bloomed from within. Here are gifts of the cherry tree, here is fruit in clusters heaped in a basket, and the basket is woven, not from alien twigs, but from branches of the plant itself. And if you look at the vine-sprays woven together and at the clusters hanging from them and how the grapes stand out one by one, you will certainly hymn <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> and speak of the vine as Queenly giver of grapes. You would say that even the grapes in the painting are good to eat and full of winey juice. And the most charming point of all this is: on a leafy branch is yellow honey already within the comb and ripe to stream forth if the comb is pressed; and on another leaf is cheese new curdled and quivering; and there are bowls of milk not merely white but gleaming, for the cream floating upon it makes it seem to gleam. </p>                        </div>

For of frankincense and cinnamon and myrrh it has enough already, and it seems to me to give out also a fragrance as of <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>. Accordingly the artistry of the painting must be praised, first, because the artist, in making the border of precious stones, has used not colours but light to depict them, putting a radiance in them like the pupil in an eye, and, secondly, because he even makes us hear the hymn. For the maidens are singing, are singing, and the chorister frowns at one who is off the key, clapping her hands and trying earnestly to bring her into tune . . . For as to their garments, they are simple and such as not to impede their movements if they should play — for instance, the close-fitting girdle, the chiton that leaves the arm free, and the way they enjoy treading with naked feet on the tender grass and drawing refreshment from the dew; and the flowered decoration of their garments, and the colours used on them — the way they harmonize the one with the other — are represented with wonderful truth; for painters who fail to make the details consistent with one another do not depict the truth in their paintings. As to the figures of the maidens, if we were to leave the decision regarding them to <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> or any other judge, I believe he would be at a loss how to vote, so close is the rivalry among them in rosy arms and flashing eyes and fair cheeks and in honeyed voices, to use the charming expression of <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a>. </p>                        </div>

For the boy's leg is straight and his arms come down to his knees (for such arms are excellent assistants in the race); his hair is charming and loose; for <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyrus</a> in sport seems to shift it about, so that as it falls, now here, now there, the boy's appearance may be changed. Already the boy has a frowning brow and an air of spirited haughtiness, but these are made gentle by a guileless look and by gracious cheeks that send for a tender smile. The cloak he wears is probably his mother's gift; for it is beautiful and its colour is sea-purple with red glints shading into a dark blue. <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a> flatters him by saying that he catches hares like a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and vies with fawns in running; at any rate, he has just caught a fawn and comes to <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a> to claim his reward, and <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a>, delighting to be asked, stands with fore-legs bent so as to be on a level with the boy and offers him apples fair and fragrant from the fold of his garment — for their very fragrance seems to be depicted — and with his hand he offers him a honeycomb dripping with honey, thanks to the diligent foraging of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>.

That the expression seen in the eye of <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a> is gentle is the result of his justice, but the lyre also does its part, through whose music he has become cultured; but now there is also something of cozening in his look, no doubt because <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Cheiron</a> knows that this soothes children and nurtures them better than milk. </p>                        </div>

One should also admire the shield, of moderate size but large enough to cover the breast.

She prays to conquer men, even as she has now conquered them; for I do not think she loves to be loved. The part of her hair that is fastened up is arranged with modesty that tempers her high spirit, while that which hangs loose gives her vigour and the look of a bacchante. Yellow, even yellower than gold, is her disarranged hair; while the hair on the other side differs also somewhat in hue because of its orderly arrangement. The way her eyebrows begin at the same point and rise together from the nose is charming; but more charming still is the curve they make; for the brows ought not only to be set above the eyes but should also be set in an arch around them. As for the cheek, it receives the yearning that emanates from the eyes, yet it delights in merriment — for it is mostly in the cheek that mirth is shown — and the colour of the eyes varies from grey to black; the joy they show is due to the occasion, their beauty is a gift of nature, while their haughtiness arises from her authority as ruler. The mouth is delicately formed and filled with love's harvest, most sweet to kiss, most difficult to describe. But you may observe, my boy, all you need to be told: the lips are full of colour and even the mouth is well proportioned and it utters its prayer before the trophy of victory; if we care to listen attentively, perhaps it will speak in Greek. </p>                        </div>

His leg is slender and his body proportioned for running with ease, and his blood shines red, like colour on ivory, where the spear-point penetrated his breast. The youth lies there, not sad of aspect nor yet like a corpse, but still joyous and smiling; for it was with a look of joy on his face (because, I fancy, he had saved his father's life) that <a href=/people/449 target=_blank>Antilochus</a> died from the spear-thrust, and the soul left his countenance, not when he was in pain, but when gladness prevailed. </p>                        </div>

She drinks the water though she is not thirsty, and takes it in her hands, and keeps up a conversation with it as though the murmur of the water were human speech, and sheds tears of love into the water; and the river, since it loves her in return, delights to mingle her tears with its stream. Now a delightful feature of the painting is the figure of Meles lying on a bed of crocus and lotus blossoms and delighting in the hyacinth because of its fresh young bloom, and presenting an appearance delicate and youthful and not at all lacking in cleverness — indeed you would say that the eyes of Meles were contemplating some poetic theme. It is a delightful feature also that he does not pour forth turbulent streams at his source, as boorish rivers are usually painted; nay, he but cuts a passage through the earth with the tips of his fingers and holds his hand beneath the water as it trickles noiselessly by; and to us it is clear that, for <a href=/people/7549 target=_blank>Critheis</a>, this is no dream, nor ware you writing this love of yours in water; for the river loves you, I know it well, and he is devising a chamber for you both by lifting up a wave beneath which shall be your couch. If you do not believe me, I will tell you the very construction of the chamber; a slight breeze running under a wave causes it to curve over and makes it resonant and also of brilliant hue; for the reflection of the sun lends colour to the uplifted water. </p>                        </div>

I think the veil is the gift of some <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereid</a> or <a href=/people/952 target=_blank>Naiad</a>, for it is reasonable to assume that these goddesses dance together in honour of the river Meles, since it offers them fountains not far from its mouth. Her glance has something so charming and simple about it, that even tears do not cause it to lose its graciousness. Her neck is all the more lovely for not being adorned, since chains and flashing stones and necklaces lend a not unpleasing brilliance to women of moderate beauty and by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> they contribute something of beauty to them, but they are not becoming to ugly women or to very beautiful women; for they show up the ugliness of the former and detract from the beauty of the latter. Let us examine the hands; the fingers are delicate, of graceful length, and as white as the fore-arm. And you see the forearm, how it appears yet whiter through the white garment; and the firm breasts gleam under the garment. </p>                        </div>

These two loved each other and the woman had made her own ornaments into armour for him; he was fighting for <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> against <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> on a chariot with four poles and eight <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, . . . still a youth of downy beard, of an age when the poets consider even young trees which have been torn out of the ground to be objects of pity. The wounds, my boy, are such as swordsmen make — for it accords with this style of fighting so to cut down the foe — some of his pure blood stains his armour, some the man himself, and some is sprinkled on the crest which rises <a href=/people/9528 target=_blank>hyacinthine</a> red from the golden helmet and sheds splendour on the gold itself. A beautiful burial offering are these arms, for one who had not brought shame upon them nor cast them away in battle; and <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> brings many <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> gifts to a brave man, among other things a chariot load of golden sand from the over-abundant treasures of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>; but <a href=/people/4646 target=_blank>Pantheia</a> believes that the tomb still lacks the offerings due it unless she gives herself as a funeral sacrifice to <a href=/people/4807 target=_blank>Abradates</a>. She has already driven the dagger through her breast, but with such fortitude that she has not uttered even a groan at the thrust. At any rate she lies there, her mouth retaining its natural shapeliness and by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> a beauty the bloom of which so rests upon her lips that it shines forth clear, silent though she is. She has not yet drawn out the dagger but still presses on it, holding it by the hilt — a hilt that resembles a golden stalk with emeralds for its branches — but the fingers are more charming still; she has lost none of her beauty through pain, and indeed she does not seem to suffer pain at all but rather to depart in joy because she sends herself away. And she departs, not like the wife of <a href=/people/242 target=_blank>Protesilaus</a>, wreathed with the garlands of the Bacchic rites she had been celebrating, nor yet like the wife of <a href=/people/552 target=_blank>Capaneus</a>, decked out as for sacrifice; but she keeps her beauty unadorned and just as it was while <a href=/people/4807 target=_blank>Abradates</a> was alive, and takes it thus away with her, letting her thick black hair fall unrestrained over her shoulders and neck, yet just showing her white throat, which she had torn in her grief, though not in a way to disfigure it; indeed the marks made by her finger-nails are more charming than a painting. The flush on her cheeks has not left her even in death; her beauty and modesty have supplied it. Look at the moderately up-curved nostrils that form a base for the nose from which the crescent eyebrows spring like branches, black beneath the white forehead. As for the eyes my boy, let us not consider them for their size, nor ask if they are black, but let us consider the great intelligence there is in them, and by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> all the virtues of the soul which they have absorbed; for though their state excites pity, yet they have not lost their look of gladness, and though they are courageous, yet they show the courage of reason rather than of rashness, and though they are aware of death, they have not yet departed from life. <a href=/people/1185 target=_blank>Desire</a>, the companion of love, so suffuses the eyes that it seems clearly to drip from them. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> also is represented in the picture, as a part of the narrative of the deed; so also is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=demonym long=28 lat=38.5>Lydian</a> woman, catching the blood, as you see, in a fold of her golden robe. </p>                        </div>

And cups, most of them defiled with gore, fall from their hands; nor have the dying men any power to defend themselves, for they are drunken. As for the attitudes of those that have fallen, one has had his throat cut as he is partaking of food or of drink, another as he bent over the mixing-bowl has had his head cut off, another has had his hand lopped off as it carried a beaker, another as he tumbled from his couch drags the table after him, another has fallen head foremost, as a poet would say, upon his shoulders and head; one has no suspicion of death, and another lacks the strength to flee since drunkenness like a fetter has enchained him. Nor is any one of the fallen pallid of hue, since when men die in their cups the flush does not immediately leave their faces. </p>                        </div>

Therefore <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> will break through the mountains with his trident and open a gateway for the river. Indeed, this is the work which he has now undertaken, the mighty task of uncovering the plains; his hand is raised to break the mountains apart, but, before the blow has fallen, they separate a sufficient space to let the river through. In the painter's effort to make the action clear, the right side of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> has been at the same time both drawn back and advanced and he threatens to strike his blow, not merely with his hand but with his whole body. He is painted, not dark blue nor yet as a god of the sea, but as a god of the mainland. Accordingly he greets the plains as he sees that they are both broad and level like stretches of the sea. The river also rejoices as one exulting; and, keeping the usual posture of resting on his elbow (since it is not customary for a river to stand erect), he takes up the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223WTit class=place long=22.139 lat=39.726>Titaresius</a> as being light water and better to drink and promises <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a> that he will flow out in the course he had made. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a> emerges, the water already subsiding; she wears tresses of olive and grain and grasps a colt that emerges along with her.

If one wishes to speculate about such matters, the island provides natural bitumen and sulphur; and when these are mixed by the sea, the island is fanned into flame by many winds, drawing from the sea that which sets the fuel aflame. But the painting, following the accounts given by the poets, goes farther and ascribes a myth to the island.

The birds being drowsy are easily caught by torchlight, for the hunters flash a light upon them at night. But the gulls induce the tern with a part of the food they catch to act as a warden and to keep awake for them. Now though the tern is a sea-bird, yet it is simple-minded, easy-going, and inefficient at catching prey; but in resisting sleep it is strong and in fact sleeps but little. For this reason it lets out the use of its eyes to the gulls. So when the gulls fly away after food, the tern keeps guard around the home rock, and the gulls return towards evening bringing to it a tithe of what they have caught; they at once sleep round about the tern, and it stays awake and is never overcome by sleep except when they are willing. If it senses the approach of any danger it raises a piercing shrill cry, and they rise at the signal and fly away, supporting their warden if ever it grows wearing in flight.

For in truth there has been built there a likeness of a fair and splendid city no larger than a house, and therein is nurtured a royal child and the city is his plaything. There is a theatre large enough to receive him and his playfellows, and a hippodrome has been constructed of sufficient size for little <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=demonym long=14.44 lat=35.88>Melitaean</a> <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> to run races in; for the boy uses these as <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and they are held together by yoke and chariot, and the drivers will be these apes that the boy regards as his servants. Yonder hare, brought into the house only yesterday, I believe, is fastened with a purple leash like a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, but it objects to being bound and seeks to slip its bonds with the help of its front feet; and a parrot and a magpie in a woven cage sing like <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Sirens</a> on the island; the magpie sings what it knows, but the parrot what it has been taught. </p>                        </div>

Meanwhile he sleeps on the soft sand, since weariness has crept over him in wrestling; and, filled with sleep, his mouth open, he draws full breaths deep in his chest, and <a href=/people/422 target=_blank>Sleep</a> himself stands over him in visible form, making much, I think, of his own part in the fall of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a> also lies there, but whereas art paints <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> as alive and warm, it represents <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a> as dead and withered and abandons him to <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>. </p>                        </div>

The frenzied <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> is surrounded by the whole body of his servants, like a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> that is running riot, surrounded by herdsmen; one tries to bind him, another is struggling to restrain him, another shouts loudly, one clings to his hands, one tries to trip him up, and others leap upon him. He, however, has no consciousness of them, but he tosses those who approach him and tramples on them, dribbling much foam from his mouth and smiling a grim and alien smile, and while keeping his eyes intently fixed on what he is doing, yet letting the thought behind his glance stray away to the fancies that deceive him. His throat bellows, his neck dilates, and the veins about the neck swell, the veins through which all that feeds the disease flows up to the sovereign parts of the head. The Fury which has gained this mastery over him you have many times seen on the stage, but you cannot see her here; for she has entered into <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> himself and she dances through his breast and leaps up inside him and muddles his mind.

Now this doorway belongs to a house by no means prosperous; you will say it has been abandoned by its master, and the court within seems deserted, nor do the columns still support its roof, for they have settled and collapsed; nay, it is inhabited by <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a> only, for this creature loves to weave its web in quiet. Look at the threads also; for as the <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spiders</a> spew out their yarn they let it down to the pavement — and the painter shows them descending on it and scrambling up and soaring aloft, as <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> says, and trying to fly — and in the angles they weave their nests, some spread out flat, some hollow; the flat ones are good to summer in, and the hollow sort they weave is useful in winter. Now the painter has been successful in these respects also: that he has wrought the <a href=/people/10968 target=_blank>spider</a> itself in so painstaking a fashion, has marked its spots with fidelity to nature and has painted its repulsive fuzzy surface and its savage nature — all this is the mark of a good craftsman and one skilled in depicting the truth. And he has also woven these delicate webs for us. For look! here is a cord forming a square that has been thrown about the corners to be as it were a cable to hold the web, and to this cord is attached a delicate web of many concentric circles, and tight lines, making meshes running from the outside circle to the smallest one, are interwoven at intervals corresponding to the distance between the circles. And the weavers travel across them, drawing tight such of the threads as have become loose. But they win a reward for their weaving and feed on the flies whenever any become enmeshed in the webs. Hence the painter has not omitted their prey either; for one fly is caught by the feet, another by the tip of its wing, the head of another is being eaten, and they squirm in their effort to escape, yet they do not disarrange or break the web. </p>                        </div>

The palace court must also be of gold — indeed, it seems not to be a painting at all; for it is so painted as to seem to be a real building — we catch the fragrance of both frankincense and myrrh — for the barbarians use these to pollute the freedom of the air; and let us infer that one spearman is talking to another about the Greek, marveling at him from a vague knowledge of his great achievements.

The very place, my boy, is painted as fragrant with incense and replete with the divine voice; and in it honour is paid to a bronze <a href=/people/741 target=_blank>Echo</a>, whom I think you see placing her hand upon her lips, since a bronze vessel has been dedicated to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod class=place long=20.7878 lat=39.5464>Dodona</a>, that resounds most of the day and is not silent till someone takes hold of it. </p>                        </div>

For the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a>, coming to earth in their own proper forms, with clasped hands are dancing the year through its course, I think, and the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> in her wisdom brings forth for them all the fruits of the year. Tread not on the hyacinth or the rose I shall not say to the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> of the spring-time; for when trodden on they seem sweeter and exhale a sweeter fragrance than the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> themselves. Walk not on the ploughed fields when soft I shall not say to the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> of the winter-time; for if they are trodden on by the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> they will produce ear of grain. And the golden-haired <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> yonder are walking on the spikes of the ears, but not so as to break or bend them; nay, they are so light that they do not even sway the stalks. It is charming of you, grape-vines, that ye try to lay hold of the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> of autumn-tide; for you doubtless love the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> because they make you fair and wine-sweet. </p>                        </div>

How they sing, and how they whirl in the dance! Note too the fact that the back of none of them is turned to us; and note the raised arm, the freedom of flying hair, the cheek warm from the running, and the eyes that join in the dance. Perhaps they permit us to weave a tale about the painter; for it seems to me that he, falling in with the <a href=/people/2317 target=_blank>Horae</a> as they danced, were caught up by them into their dance, the goddesses perhaps thus intimating that grace (hora) must attend his painting. </p>                        </div>
