                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2018.tlg040:1'><b>&sect; 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> Chronicle <br />I have perused diverse histories of the past which the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> and <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> have recorded, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> have written in detail, and which the Greeks have narrated as accurately as possible. [These works] contain [information about] the times of kings and Olympiads (which translates athletes), about the brave deeds which were performed by barbarians and Greeks, by Aryans and non-Aryans [i.e., by peoples inside and outside the Iranian cultural world], and about the marvelous accomplishments of their generals, sages, braves, poets, storytellers, and philosophers. I thought it would be appropriate to write down everything in brief, especially the beneficial and important things, and further to put adjacent to [these accounts] the history of the Hebrew patriarchs as revealed in the Bible. And thus we might establish how long before the life-giving revelation [of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>] <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and the Hebrew prophets who succeeded him lived and what they, filled with the divine spirit, said before [the time of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>]. In this fashion it might be possible to recognize easily when the braves of each nation appeared [compared with] when the celebrated Hebrew prophets lived and, one by one, who all their leaders were. <br />Permit me, right at the outset, to caution everyone against [believing that] there can be complete accuracy with respect to chronology. Indeed, we would benefit by contemplating what that wise Teacher told his acquaintances: It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority [Acts 1:7]. It seems to me that [Jesus], as God and Lord, delivered this succinct verdict not solely regarding the end of the world but about all times, in order to discourage those who would dare attempt such a futile undertaking. <br />Let us also, in our own words, confirm the accuracy of the Teacher's dictum, for it is not possible to know unerringly the chronology of the entire world, not from the Greeks, not from the barbarians, not from other [peoples], not even the from the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>. We would be pleased if just two points were taken from our words. <br />First, do not be deceived into believing, as others do, that chronology [always] can be precisely determined. <br />Second, despite this, to the extent that it is possible, use clarity to recognize the nature of the investigation which confronts you, and then proceed resolutely. <br />It should come as no surprise that the Greeks are absent [from recording information about events in antiquity] for a long period, since [during that time] they corrupted themselves with diverse forms of iniquities; moreover, for a long period, until <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a>' generation, they were entirely unlettered since, they say, it was <a href=/people/83 target=_blank>Cadmus</a> who first brought them an alphabet from the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>. Quite justly did that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> reproach <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> in <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s book [<a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> 22b] when he remarked: Oh, <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, you Greeks are always [like] children. Nothing resembling an old man may be found amongst you. [And thus] it is impossible to study ancient history from you. On the other hand, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> relate many fabulous accounts [about ancient times], as do the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>, since they reckon their literacy embraces more than 400,000 years. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> have written extensively about [false] gods and their offspring, about ghosts and spirits of the dead, and of other [mortal] kings, in fable-like, delirious ravings. </p>                        </div>

[And why should I] who so loves the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> point out, in the appropriate places, where I have found inconsistencies [in their accounts]? [I have done it] to reprove the boasting of vainglorious chronographers. <br />I shall approach the task before me with writings which have come down from the past. First I shall present a chronology of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>, then [I shall present a list of] the kings of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, then the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a>, followed by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. In the next section [I shall present] the entire chronology of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> in order. [This will be followed by] a third section [describing] the period of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> dynasties including the <a href=/people/8220 target=_blank>Ptolemids</a> who reigned after <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. Next, one by one, I will introduce the beginnings of other [nations], how the Greeks tell their own history. First, [I will tell] about those ruling in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a> then in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>, then in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> itself, from first to last, those in Lacadaemon, those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, and whoever else ruled over any other part of the sea. <br />I shall add to this a description of the Olympiads, which the Greeks wrote. Once all these [parts] have been set forth, I shall record, one by one, the first kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=ethnic long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonians</a>, followed by the those of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> and <a href=/people/3539 target=_blank>Asiatics</a> who ruled after <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Next, each topic in a separate segment, I will describe those descendants of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> who, after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, ruled over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> later called Romans; then the descendants of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> who built the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; then the successors of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> who became emperors and the consuls who ruled in the intervening years. <br />I will convert all the material collected about all these folk into chronological tables. Including, from the beginning, who from each nation ruled as king and for how long, I will put these [facts] into separate [chronological tables] together with the number of years involved. In this way, if we need to know who ruled and for how long [that information] will be easily and quickly accessible. Furthermore, the valiant deeds of each kingdom, which all nations have transmitted, I will place in summary form within [my account] of [these] kingdoms. <br />However, that [material] will be in the second part of this work. But at present, in the next section, let us examine what the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>' ancestors have related about [their own] chronology. <br />The <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> Chronicle </p>                        </div>

He mentions the period when Nabonassarus was king, but merely records the kings' names not saying anything precise about their deeds, perhaps because he did not consider that they had done anything worth recalling — beyond [providing] a list of their names. This is how he begins. <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> says that Alorus was the first <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> king to rule in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, reigning for 10 sars. A sar consists of 3,600 years, and this [figure may be] broken down into [units called] ners and soses. He says that one ner is 600 years, while one sos is 60 years. This is how the [<a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>] ancients reckoned [periods of] years. Having stated this, he proceeds to enumerate the kings of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, one by one. There were 10 kings from the first king, Alorus, to <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>. He says that during [the latter's] time the first great flood occurred, which <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> also mentions. He states that the reign of those kings consisted of a total of 120 sars, making a total [in our denomination] of 2043 [Arm. sxd\ myriad years. He describes them one by one thusly. <br />He says that on the death of Alorus, his son, Alaparus, [ruled for] 3 sars; after Alaparus, the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> Almelon, from the city of Pautibiblon [? Bad-tibira], ruled for 13 sars; after Almelon, Ammenon, from the city of Pautibiblon, ruled for 12 sars. Now in his day a creature called Idotion, having the [composite] shape of a man and a fish, emerged from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>. After [Ammenon], Amegalarus, from the city of Pautibiblon, ruled for 18 sars, and after him, the shepherd Daonus, from the city of Pautibiblon, ruled for 10 sars. In his day, once again there emerged from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> four hybrid beings (Arm. yushkaparik) of the same man-fish type [as Idotion]. Then Edovanchus, from the city of Pautibiblon, ruled for 18 sars. During his reign once again another sort of man-fish being emerged from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a>, called Odacon. He says that all of them were from Oannes, [and] he concisely describes them, one by one. Then the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> Amenpsinus, from [the city of] Lanchara ruled. His reign lasted for 10 sars. Then the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> Otiartes from Lanchara ruled. His reign lasted 8 sars. Upon the death of Otiartus, his son <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> ruled for 18 sars. The great deluge occurred in his time. Altogether [this makes] 10 monarchs [ruling for a total of] 100 and 20 sars. [This material] may be presented as follows: <br />1. Alorus 10 sars <br />2. Alaparus 3 sars <br />3. Almelon 13 sars <br />4. Ammenon 12 sars <br />5. Amegalarus 18 sars <br />6. Daonus 10 sars <br />7. Edovanchus 18 sars <br />8. Amempsinus 10 sars <br />9. Otiartes 8 sars <br />10. <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> 18 sars. <br />This makes a total of 10 kings [ruling for] a total of 120 sars. And they say that 120 sars equal 2043 myriad years, assuming that a sar consists of 3,600 years. <br />Such are the figures related in <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Alexander Polyhistor</a>'s book. And if a person regards this as accurate history, and accepts as valid [reigns lasting] for such myriads of years, then [that person] would have to believe other incredible material found in the same book. Howbeit, I will relate what that same <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a> relates in the aforementioned historical romance, and will resume their previous [thread] which [<a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Alexander</a>] Polyhistor has put in his own book. One after the other he recounts these types of things. </p>                        </div>

First, he says, the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a> was established on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/346437WTig class=place long=43.702 lat=34.5971>Tigris</a> [River] and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> passed through it. The country brings forth of its own accord wild wheat and barley, lentils, peas, and sesame; and in the tranquil, swampy rivers a type of edible tuber is found which they call gongk' (Arm. turnip), having the [same] virtue as barley bread. Also found there are dates and apples as well as various other fruits. There are fish and birds, wild fowl and marsh fowl. <br />There are sections by the Arab areas devoid of water and fruit, while opposite the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>' land are areas which are mountainous and fruit-bearing. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> dwell a multitude of foreign peoples from the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> land, and they live wantonly like beasts and wild animals. <br />Now it happened that in the first year, in the confines of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a>, there emerged from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> an awesome creature which was named Oannes. As <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> relates in his book, [this being] had the complete body of a fish. Yet by the fish's head was another appropriate [human] head, and by the tail were [a pair of] human feet, and it could speak human language. A picture/likeness of [Oannes] has been preserved to this day. He further states that this creature kept company with humans during the day, completely abstaining from any kind of food, instructing people in letters and the techniques of different arts [including] city and temple [building], knowledge of laws, the nature of weights and measures, how to collect seeds and fruits; indeed, he taught humankind everything necessary for domestic life on earth. From that time on no one [individual] has discovered more. Now when the sun went down, the Oannes creature once again returned to the sea, remaining until morning in the vast expanse of the waters. Thus it lived the life of an amphibian. Subsequently other similar creatures came forth, as the book of the kings makes clear. <br />Furthermore it is said that Oannes wrote about deeds and virtues, giving humankind words and wisdom. </p>                        </div>

And there were other sorts of creatures [on the earth]. Half of them could reproduce themselves [asexually], while there were others which procreated and bore humans with two wings, others with four wings and two faces, with one body and two heads, male and female, and [others] having both male and female natures [combined]. Other humans had the legs of <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, horns on their heads, others had <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' hooves. Others had the rear half of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and the front half of a human. Some had the hybrid appearance of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> and a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>. Also born were <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> with human heads, <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> with quadripartite bodies having the flippers of a fish and a fish's tail sprouting from the hindquarters. [There were] <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> with <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>' heads as well as humans and other creatures with <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' heads and/or human forms and the extremities of fish. In addition there were diverse sorts of dragon-shaped creatures, hybrid fish, reptiles, <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snakes</a>, and many types of astonishing creatures of differing appearance. The pictures of each of them are preserved at the temple of <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>. All of them were ruled over by a woman named Markaye' who was called T'aghatt'ay in <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>. The Greek translation of T'aladday is sea. <br />Now while all of these mixed [creatures] were arising, <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> attacked. He cut the woman [i.e. the sea] in two, making half the sky and the other half the earth, and he killed the creatures in it. Thus [information] about the natural world is expressed in the form of an allegorical fable which means that initially there existed only water and moisture and the creatures in it. Then that deity cut off its head and another deity took the blood which dripped from it, mixed it with soil, and created humankind. Thus they became wise and partook of the thoughts of the gods. <br />As regards <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, which translates into Greek as <a href=/people/1654 target=_blank>Dios</a> and into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> as Aramazd, he split the darkness in two, separating heaven and earth from each other, and then smoothed and fashioned the world. [Those] creatures which could not endure the strength of the light perished. Then <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> looked at the world, [both] the desert [parts] and the fruitful [parts], and gave an order to one of the gods to take [some of] the blood which was dripping down from his own severed head and to mix it with soil and to create humans, other animals, and beasts which could withstand this air. <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> also established the sun, the moon, and the five wandering stars. According to [<a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>] Polyhistor, this is what <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a> relates in his first volume. In the second volume he provides [information] about the reigns of the ten kings individually, which we have already treated. [This portion, from Oannes to <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>,] extends [the account back] more than 40 myriads. </p>                        </div>

[The <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> account] simply defies reason and is apocryphal, no matter how it is interpreted. [Even] if someone should accept [the account], then that [individual] should not accept [the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a>] calculation of time without examination. If, according to their chronology, there were [really] so many thousands of years amassed, and if the successors of these [early] peoples [performed] their acts and deeds over a similar extended period, and if only 10 kings could have lived for so many myriads of years, who would believe that there might be any truth in such things and fables? Now it is possible that the sars we cited [earlier] represented a shorter interval of time than what others have assigned to them. For example, the ancestors of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> spoke of a lunar cycle, that is, a month contained 30 days, which they referred to as a year. Others referred to three-month periods as hours. I am saying that they styled seasons of the year and three-month intervals as years. Consequently it could be the same sort of thing when the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> spoke of sars. <br />Accordingly, [the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>] considered that there were just 10 generations from Alorus whom they considered their first king until <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>. They relate that the great Flood occurred in the latter's day. <br />Furthermore <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, in the Hebrew books, says that there were 10 generations before the Flood, and each generation before the Flood is described, one by one. The Hebrew history reckons 2000 years for those 10 generations. <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> histories also detail the same number of generations as the writings of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> do, though not embracing the same amount of time, since they reckon the 10 generations lasting for 120 sars, equaling 2043 myriad years. <br />Now for those of you seeking the truth in this matter it is simple to accept that <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> is the same [individual] as the man the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> call <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>, during whose lifetime the great Flood occurred. The book of [<a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>] Polyhistor describes [the Flood] in the following manner. </p>                        </div>

His text relates the details as follows. <br />He says that <a href=/people/4368 target=_blank>Chronos</a> — who is called the father of Aramazd [<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>] and, by others, Time — came [to <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>] in his sleep and revealed to him that on the 15th of the month of Desios, which is the [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>] month of Marer [December/ January], humankind would perish in a flood. [<a href=/people/4368 target=_blank>Chronos</a>] commanded that the entire book [of Oannes?] — the beginning, middle, and ending — be taken and buried [for safety] at Heliopolis (the city of the sun), in Sippar. [He also commanded him] to fashion a ship and to go inside it with his family and closest friends, and to put inside [the ship] provisions and drink, animals, birds, and quadrupeds, and to be completely ready to set sail. Then [<a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>] inquired where he should sail the ship, and [<a href=/people/4368 target=_blank>Chronos</a>] replied that he should [just] pray to the gods [and] that all would be well for humanity. And so [<a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>] saw to building the ship which [measured] 15 stadia in length and two stadia in width. <br />After doing all that he was bidden, [<a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>] entered the vessel with his wife, children, and closest friends. <br />Then the deluge came. As soon as it had receded, <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> released some birds. However, when they were unable to find anything to eat or any place to perch, he took them back on board. A few days later he again released some birds, and they too returned to the ship, [but this time] their claws were covered with mud. <br />Finally he released them a third time, and this time they did not return to the ship. By this <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> realized that the ground had become visible. He opened a side of the ship's deck and observed that the boat had landed on some mountain. He emerged with his wife, a daughter, and the navigator, and worshipped (kissed the ground). He fashioned an altar and made sacrifice to the gods. And thereafter he and those who descended with him from the ship did not appear to anyone. Those [people] who had remained on board and had not emerged with <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> subsequently descended and sought for him, circulating around shouting out his name. But <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> never again appeared to them. However [his] voice came to them from the air and commanded that they should worship the gods, and that he, because of his worship of the gods, had gone to dwell where the gods dwelled. His wife, daughter, and the ship's pilot shared in this honor. He also ordered them to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, for so the gods had commanded, and to excavate and remove the manuscripts buried at the city of Sippar and give them [back] to humanity. As for the place where they emerged [from the ship], it was the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. <br />Now when [the people] heard all this, they offered sacrifices to the gods, and then went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> on foot. <br />As for that ship which landed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, they say that to the present a small portion of it remains in the Korduats' Mountains [RB: south of Lake Van] in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. Some [folk] scrape off the naphtha which had been used as a sealant for the ship and make amulets from it to treat pain. Now [those who disembarked] went and arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, excavated in Sippar city and removed [manuscripts of] the book. Then they constructed numerous cities, erected temples to the gods and renewed <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> once more. <br />Along with this story, [<a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>] Polyhistor tells the following story of the building of the tower [of Babel], similar to the account [found] in the writings of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, [almost] to the syllable. </p>                        </div>

But Almighty God stirred up a wind which destroyed the Tower, and [God] divided each [of the participants] with distinct languages. It is for this reason that the city was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. It was after the Flood that the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titan</a> <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> lived, and stirred up a war with <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a>. This is sufficient about the building of the Tower. <br />Polyhistor supplements this [topic] by adding that after the Flood, Evexius ruled over the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> for four ners. After him his son, Comosbelus, held authority for four ners and five soses. Polyhistor counts a total of 86 monarchs from the time of <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> and the Flood until the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and he provides the name of each one from <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a>' book. The total for all of them comes to three myriad, three thousand and ninety-one [33,091] years. Now after these generations, one after the other, suddenly the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> massed troops against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and took it, and set up tyrants of their own [nationality] there. <br />Then he enumerates the names of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> tyrants, 8 of them, ruling for 224 years. Then 11 kings for ...years; then <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> again, 49 kings for 458 years; then 9 Arab kings for 245 years. After this period he writes that Shamiram [<a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>] ruled the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. Then he briefly lists the names of 45 monarchs, giving them a total of 526 years. He says that after them, the kingship of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> was held by a man named Phulus [Tiglath-Pileser III], also recalled in Hebrew history as Phulos. They say that he came against the country of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>. <br />Polyhistor relates that following [Phulus] <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> became king. He is mentioned by the Hebrew books as ruling during the time of King <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a> and the prophet <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a>. Scripture mentions in order that In the fourteenth year of King Hezikiah, <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> king of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> came up against all the fortified cities of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> and took them [2 Kings 18:13]. After this entire narration he continues with [the information that] [ <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>'s] son Asordan [Esarhaddon] ruled after him. Then he proceeds to relate that in that period Hezikiah became sick. Continuing on, he states that the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>, Merodach Baldan [Marduk II], sent messengers, letters, and gifts to <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a>. This is what the Hebrew books say. <br />Now the historian of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> mentions <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>, his son Asordan, Marodach Baghdan, and with them <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> as our passage has done.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2018.tlg040:9'><b>&sect; 9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the same <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Alexander</a> [Polyhistor] on the deeds and valor of Sennecherib and <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>. <br />After <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>'s brother ruled, then Akises reigned over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. He barely held power for 30 days, before he was slain by Maradoch Baladanus. The latter forcibly ruled for six months until a certain Elibus killed him and seized power. Now <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, in the third year of his reign, massed an army, went against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>, fought them, and triumphed. He arrested [Elibus] and his associates and had them taken to the country of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. So [ <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>] dominated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. He then enthroned his son Asordanios, and he himself returned to the country of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. <br />Now soon thereafter he received word that the Greeks had come to the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> to wage war. <br />[ <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>] went there and deployed his troops, brigade by brigade. He triumphed over the enemy, despite the fact that many of his own troops were killed. As a memorial to his conquest, he had a statue of himself erected on the spot and ordered that an account of his bravery and power be inscribed in the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> language as a memorial for the future. [Polyhistor] says that [ <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>] built the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> in the likeness of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and named it Tarsin. And he relates that after all his other accomplishments he went on to rule for 19 years, until he died as a result of a plot hatched by his own son, Ardamusanus. This is from Polyhistor. <br />The account chronologically is in harmony with what is written in Scripture. According to <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a>, <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> ruled during the period of <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a> for 18 years; his son succeeded him for 8 years; Sammuges followed, for 21 years; followed by his brother, for 21 years. Then Nabupalasar ruled for 20 years, followed by <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, for 43 years. From <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> up to <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> the regnal years total 88. <br />If one examines Hebrew writings, nearly the same [information] will be found. For following <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a>, his son <a href=/people/2328 target=_blank>Manasseh</a> ruled over the remaining <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> for 55 years. Then <a href=/people/2989 target=_blank>Amos</a> [ruled] for 12 years, followed by <a href=/people/4173 target=_blank>Josiah</a>, followed by Jehoiakim. At the beginning of the latter's reign, <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> came and besieged <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and took the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> captive to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. From <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a> to <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> there are 88 years, just as <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a> calculated from the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> sources. <br />After [describing] all this, <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a> again turns to the works and deeds of <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>. The Hebrew sources also refer to his son[s]. And he records them one by one. They say that the philosopher <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> lived in this period, during their time. Now following Sammuges, <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a> ruled the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> for 21 years. He sent an auxiliary army to the patriarch and lord of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, Azhdahak, to secure one of his daughters, Amuhean, as a wife for his son <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>. Then <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> ruled for 43 years. He massed troops and came and took captive the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, and <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. Since the Hebrew sources are in harmony with <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a> here, there is no need to elaborate. <br />Following <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, his son Amilmarudochus ruled for 12 years. In Hebrew history he is called Ilmaroduchus. After him, <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a> says, Neglisarus ruled the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> for 4 years, followed by Nabodenus for 17 years. It was during his reign that <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>' son, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, massed troops and came against the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. Nabodenus resisted, was defeated, and took to flight. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> ruled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> for 9 years. <br />However, he died in another battle, in the plain of Daas. Subsequently <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> [II] ruled for 8 years, followed by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> for 36 years, followed by <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> and other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> kings. <br />Berosus described the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> kings briefly one by one, and so does <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a>. Now it is quite clear that from the time when <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> massed troops and took the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> captive until the time of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>' rule over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, 70 years had transpired. Hebrew history also confirms this, considering that they had been in captivity for 70 years, reckoning [that event] from the first year of <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> until the time of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. <br />Abydenus' <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> history confirms this. In agreement with <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a>, he relates it as follows. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2018.tlg040:10'><b>&sect; 10</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abydenus on the first <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> kings. <br />So much for an account of <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> wisdom. Now it is said that Alorus was the first to rule over the land of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> as king. He claimed that the most provident Lord had designated him as shepherd of [his] people, and he ruled for 10 sars. A sar is 3,600 years, a ner is 600 years, and a sos is 60 years. Alaparus ruled after him, followed by Almelon from the city of Pautibiblon. During his reign the second Anidostus emerged from the sea. [He was a being] like Oannes, who had the appearance of a semi-divine hero. [Almelon] was followed by Ammenon, then by Amegazarus. Next the shepherd was Daonus. During his reign, four amphibious beings came on land, emerging from the sea: Iovdocos, E'newgamos, E'newboghos, and Amenentos. Anodap'os [, another sea-creature, appeared] during the reign of Edorescho who ruled after [Daonus]. Other [kings] ruled after him, until <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>. These are also recalled by <a href=/people/3327 target=_blank>Polyhistor</a>. Now here is what [Abydenus] wrote about the Flood. <br />Abydenus on the Flood. <br />After him others ruled, including <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>. It was to him that <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> gave advance warning about a great deluge of rain [which would begin] on the 15th of the month of Desios, which is [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> month of] Marer. [<a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a>] ordered that all books in the city of Heliopolis, in Sippar, be concealed [i.e. protected]. <br /><a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> did all this, and wanted to set sail for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=place long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenia</a>, when suddenly [the prophesy] of the god was realized on the sailors. On the third day, after the rain had decreased, <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> released some of the birds to determine whether land could be found in the midst of so much water. Now [the birds] flew off over the limitless expanse of sea but, not finding any perch, returned to <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>. [The latter] waited another three days and then released [some birds] again. [This time] they returned with mud sticking to their claws. Soon the gods removed [<a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a>] from the sight of humankind. The ship continued on and stopped in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. The inhabitants of that land were rewarded with a useful medicine made from the wood [of the ship]. <br />Now it seems to me that it should be evident to everyone that what Abydenus writes about the Flood is confirmed by Hebrew history. Nor is it surprising if Greek and <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> writers call <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> <a href=/people/1916 target=_blank>Xisuthrus</a> or another name, or if they use their customary gods instead of God, or if they are silent about the doves, replacing them with birds. Such is Abydenus' account of the Flood [based on] <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> history. He also presents the following account of the building of the Tower, which supports the Mosaic narrative. It is said that people in early times had become so enamoured of their own power and size, that they even mocked the gods and wrought foolishness. They began to construct an enormous tower in the place now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. When they neared the gods in heaven, the winds aided the gods by blowing and causing that gigantic, artful structure to collapse. The ruins were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. [If] until that time, [everyone] spoke the same language, [afterwards] the gods introduced many different languages among the multitudes. After this <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> and the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a> engaged each other in warfare. [Abydenus] also recalls <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a> in the following manner. </p>                        </div>

He conquered and subdued <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> under his control, defeated the Greek naval fleet off the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and constructed a temple of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> erecting [there] a bronze monument and inscribing on it [an account] of his valor. In addition, [Sennecharib] built <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> in accordance with the style and plan of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349WKyd class=place long=34.92 lat=36.9191>Cydnus</a> River flows through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>, just as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> flows through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. <br />After [ <a href=/people/11096 target=_blank>Sennacherib</a>] Nergilus became king, but he was slain by his son Adramelus. The latter was slain by his brother Axerdis, who shared the same father but not the same mother. He pursued troops to the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a> and entered it. [Axerdis] was the first to muster mercenary troops, one of whom was <br /><a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, who became a student of <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> wisdom. Axerdis conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and parts of inner <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. <br />He was succeeded by <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>. <br />Saracus was the next king of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>. Now when he learned that a motley force had attacked by sea, he immediately sent [his] general Busalossorus to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. [This general], however, plotted rebellion and sought the marriage of Amuhean, daughter of Azhdahak [<a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a>], the patriarch of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, to his son, <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>. Then he swiftly went against Ninea, that is, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>. King Saracus was informed of all this and set fire to the palace [killing himself and] whoever was inside it. Then <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> took the reigns of kingship, and surrounded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> with a secure wall. <br />After relating this [material], Abydenus provides an account of <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, which coincides with [what is found in] Hebrew writings. <br />Abydenus on <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>. <br />Now when <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> took power, he built a wall and triple ramparts around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> in the space of about 15 days. He then conducted the Armakalen River [away] from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> and dug a reservoir on the highland above the city of Sippar which was 40 leagues {hrasax) around and 20 fathoms (girk) deep. And he constructed gates which could open and always irrigate the plain. These gates were called E'k'e'tognomonas, to promote support and enthusiasm for himself. He also built a wall on the shore of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> [to protect it] from the pounding waves. He built the city of Terendos at the entrance to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabs</a>' land. He also decorated the royal court by planting sapling trees, calling this the Hanging Garden. [Abydenus] presents a detailed description of this so-called Hanging Garden. The Greeks, he says, regarded [the Hanging Garden] as [one] of the seven wonders of the world. <br />In another place the same author has this to say. In the beginning, he says, everything was water and it was called the sea. Then <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> lowered [? the waters] and distributed the lands to each [nation]. He fortified <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> by surrounding it with walls, but after the passage of a long time, [the walls] weakened. So <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> rebuilt them, and they endured until the time of the rule of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, together with their bronze gates. <br />Everything that Abydenus relates is confirmed by what <a href=/people/1662 target=_blank>Daniel</a> says. [The book of <a href=/people/1662 target=_blank>Daniel</a>, 4:30] describes how <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> boasted inordinately: Is not this great <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty? This is how <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> spoke in [the book of] the prophet <a href=/people/1662 target=_blank>Daniel</a>, since he regarded his power as proof of his goodness. Now listen to what Abydenus says [about <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>] being stronger than <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. Here is his account. <br /><a href=/people/1316 target=_blank>Megasthenes</a> says that <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, who was stronger than <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, levied troops and went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390000RIbe class=place long=-4 lat=39>Iberia</a>, which he conquered. He took and settled some of them on the fore part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Black Sea</a> coast. He subsequently relates from the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>' [accounts] that when he had returned to the royal court, some deity took control of his mind and spoke [through him] in this manner: Oh brave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>, I, <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, I predict that grief will befall you. He continues on in this vein for a while and then the historian [tells us] that after this eloquent speech he suddenly disappeared from sight. Then [<a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>'s] son, Amilmardochus, ruled. The latter was slain by his son-in-law, Niglissarus. <br />[Amilmardochus] left a son named Labossoracus, who also met with a violent end. Then Nabonedochus was invited to take the throne, although it was certainly not his [by right]. When <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, he granted [Nabonedochus] the marzpanate of the land of <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>. King <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> partly expelled him from that land. All this coincides with Hebrew accounts. <br />For <a href=/people/1662 target=_blank>Daniel</a>, in his account of <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, relates how he declined mentally. There is really nothing peculiar about the fact that the Greeks or <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> disguised his madness by saying that the gods or a demon (Arm. dew) entered his body and took it over.

These [accounts] have much in common with our own [Hebrew] writings. <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a> will attest to these [remarks]. He was a <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> by nationality and known to everyone interested in learning and wisdom, because he put into the Greek language books on <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> astrology and learning. <br />Berosus in his book of early times is in agreement with <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>' account of the flood and the extermination of humankind because of its corruption, and about the ark in which <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>, the forefather of our people, was spared, and [about how the ark] rested on the summit of the mountains in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>. One by one [Berosus] describes these folk and their times, from <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> to Nabopolassar, who was king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>. After describing [the latter's] acts and brave deeds, [Berosus] relates how [Nabopolassar] sent his son <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> to the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> and to our land with an enormous army, since he had been informed that the inhabitants of the land had rebelled. [<a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>] arrived and subdued everyone, burned and ruined the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>Temple</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and deported all of our people, settling them in the country of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. Seventy years passed from this catastrophe — the destruction of the city and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>Temple</a> — until the time of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> king <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the First.

Here is how <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a> described it. <br /><a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>'s father Nabopolassar learned that the satrap whom he had set over the lords of the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, the regions of the Syrians and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> districts had rebelled from him. Now because he himself was not able to supress [the rebellion], he put part of the troops he had assembled under the control of his son, <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>, who had reached maturity, and dispatched them. <br /><a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> went and defeated the rebel in battle, and then subdued the land as before. Now it happened that his father Nabopolassar had become ill in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and had died, after a reign of 21 years. </p>                        </div>

He entrusted the captives, <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>, Syrians, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, to some of his friends and ordered them to procede to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> with the heavily-armed troops. Meanwhile he himself [quickly] reached [the city] and found that his kingdom had been preserved by a certain one of the nobles. And so, [<a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a>] ruled over his entire patrimonial state. He ordered that the captives be settled in goodly locales in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=ethnic long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonians</a>. Then he took booty from the war and adorned the temples of Bel and the other gods with great abundance. He increased [the flow of] water to the city proper and to the suburbs and secured the place so that no besieger would be able to divert the river into the city. He added three walls to the exterior of the city, in addition to the three walls on the inside of the city building half of baked brick and bitumen and half solely of brick. <br />After enclosing the city with magnificent walls and splendidly decorating its gates, he constructed yet another palace near his father's palace whose size, beauty, and adornment one can hardly describe. Suffice it to say that it was a splendidly rare accomplishment, completely finished in fifteen days. The palace had a lofty turreted portion at the summit, constructed in such a manner as to resemble mountains and planted with a great variety of trees. This was named the Hanging Garden and it was created to satisfy the longing of his wife for the airy mountainous places where she was raised, in the high mountains of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>. This is what [Berosus] says about the king. He says a great deal more in the third book of his <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> History. There he lambasts Greek writers for vainly believing that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> was built by [Queen] <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> (Shamiram) and for attributing all the glorious wonders there to her. <br />One must accept this account from the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> History as trustworthy. There is additional confirmation from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> archival material which details [events from the reign of] this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> king.

The History of <a href=/people/986 target=_blank>Philostratus</a> supports this also where it describes the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>.

When <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> took the kingship of Asia, a start was made at rebuilding [the Temple]. <br />Confirmation of this is found in the writings of <a href=/people/4093 target=_blank>Berosus</a>, for in the third book of [his History] he writes as follows. <br /><a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> fell ill and died after beginning the construction of the aforementioned wall. He had reigned for 43 years. His son Amel-Marduk took the kingship, but he governed in a corrupt and impious manner. He was murdered by his sister's husband, Neriglissar, after ruling for two years. Then that Neriglissar, who had committed the murder, held power for four years. The latter's son Labesorachus ruled as a child for nine months. However, he suffered a violent death at the hands of relatives because of his wicked behavior. <br />After his murder, the conspirators assembled and by general agreement placed a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=demonym long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylonian</a> named Nabonidus on the throne. He had been a participant in the conspiracy. </p>                        </div>

Now in the 17th year of his reign, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> came from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> with an enormous army with which he conquered all the other kingdoms. Then he turned upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. When Nabonidus was informed about his invasion, he resisted him in battle with his troops. Defeated in battle, [Nabonidus] took to flight and then fortified himself in the city of <a href=/people/5515 target=_blank>Borsippa</a> with a few of his followers. <br />After <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> had taken <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, he ordered that the city's outer wall be razed to the ground because of its [effective] fortification and the trouble it had presented [to him] in capturing the city. Then he went to besiege Nabonidus in <a href=/people/5515 target=_blank>Borsippa</a>. Nabonidus surrendered right away since he could not endure a siege. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was merciful toward him and settled him in the land of <a href=/people/6329 target=_blank>Carmania</a>. Thus Nabonidus was removed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and sent there, where he spent the remainder of his life, and died. <br />This is all true and in accord with our literature, which states that in the 18th year of <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> our <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was destroyed, and remained ruined for 50 years. In the second year of the kingship of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> the foundations were laid and in the sixth year of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>' reign it was completed. <br />I will now add to this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> records, for it will not be superfluous to add further supporting proofs. <br />The following [citations] are for chronology. <a href=/people/1139 target=_blank>Nebuchadnezzar</a> besieged <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> for thirteen years in the days of Ithobal, their king; after him reigned Baal, ten years; after him these judges were appointed: <br />Ecnibalus, the son of Baslacus, two months; Chelbes, the son of Abdeus, ten months; Abbar, the high priest, three months; Sipunostus and Gerastratus, the sons of Abdelemus, were judges six years; after whom Balatorus reigned one year; after his death they sent and fetched Merbalus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, who reigned four years; after his death they sent for his brother Hirom, who reigned twenty years.

There is no special attention given to <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> or <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. So saying, [Abydenus] begins his account. He says that [the kings of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>] were <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, son of <a href=/people/5447 target=_blank>Arbelus</a>, son of Chaalus, son of <a href=/people/5447 target=_blank>Arbelus</a>, son of Anebus, son of Babus, son of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> king <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>. <br />Then [Abydenus] describes [the rulers] one by one, from <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> to <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>, who was the last of them. From the latter until the first Olympiad 67 years elapsed. Abydenus wrote about each of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kings, one by one in this fashion. He is not the sole [author to write about them]. <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>, too, in the summary of his first Chronology describes the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kings in the same manner to the refuge of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. <br />From the Summary of <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>, on the kingdom of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. <br />[<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>] says: <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> was the king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. During his reign, the <a href=/people/350 target=_blank>Cyclopes</a>, using thunder and lightning, fought on <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>' side in the battle <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> (Aramazd) fought against the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a>. The kings of the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a> were known at this time, one of them being <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogygus</a>. [<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>], after some brief words about him, states that the giants attacked the gods and were defeated after <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> and <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> — who were descended from the <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titans</a> — came to the aid of the gods. <br /><a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, about whom we spoke earlier, died and was regarded as a god. After him <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> ruled the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> as king for 52 years. He married <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. After [<a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>], <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> was the monarch for 42 years. Then <a href=/people/8503 target=_blank>Zames</a>, also called <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a>, ruled. Then [<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> continues] to mention each of the successive kings of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> to <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>. Shortly we too will provide a list of the names and regnal years of the monarchs. <br />[<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>], in his Canons, also writes about who succeeded them [i.e. the rulers after <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>]. <br />[<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> states:] First we described the kings of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> starting with <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, but since the length of his reign has not been passed down with certainty, we have merely recorded his name. We have begun the chronology with <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and ended it with the other <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> who held the kingship after <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>. In this fashion the entire duration [of the kingdom] may be shown clearly, as well as each individual king's [reign]. <br />Thus it turns out that the [total] duration [of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kingdom] was 1,280 years. This is <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>'s [account]. <a href=/people/12391 target=_blank>Diodorus Siculus</a> collected the same [material] in his Library.

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2018.tlg040:16'><b>&sect; 16</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;From <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>' work on the kingdom of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. <br />No testimony of the first kings of the Asian world has survived-neither about their deeds nor [even] their names. <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> was the first king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> found to be worthy of historical remembrance. [<a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>]' deeds and valor were great, and we shall endeavor to describe them briefly. And [<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] informs after narrating other things, that <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> had a son <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a> from <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, and that after [<a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>]' death, <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> buried <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>' body in the palace [out of sight] and stopped being queen [ruling instead as king]. Then after a bit [<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] says that <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> ruled over all the Asians except the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a>. She died as we previously stated after living 62 years and reigning for 42 years. Separately [<a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>] says that after [<a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>'] death, <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a>, son of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> assumed power. He maintained peace, not emulating his mother's martial and industrious manner. <br />Again, further on, [<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] says that in such a fashion royal power was handed down from father to son, from generation to generation until <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>. During his reign royal power passed from the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, after lasting more than 1,300 years as <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a> observes in his second book. <br />But [these authors] did not bother to record the names of these kings or the lengths of their reigns, since they accomplished nothing worthy of recall. The only event meriting recording [during this interval] was the [military] assistance sent to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> by the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> under general <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a>, <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>' son. <br />While Teutamus — the 26th king from <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>' son, <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a> — was the reigning king of the Asian world the Greeks, under <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>, mustered troops and went to the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> to fight. By this time the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> had ruled over Asia for more than a thousand years. <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, in difficulty because of the war, beseechingly requested military aid from the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> king. [Teutamus acceded] and provided [<a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>] with 10,000 [troops] from the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, an equal number from the Nusians, and two hundred chariots, [all] under [the command of] <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>' son <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a>. [<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] further states that the barbarians said that <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a> had performed such feats of bravery that they were recorded in the royal books. <br /><a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>, the 35th king from <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> who organized the state, became the final king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. He surpassed all his predecessors in luxurious living and laziness. After a bit [<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] informs that [<a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>] was so dissolute that not only did he ruin his own life, but he wreaked the entire <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> state which had endured from time immemorial. Now it happened that there was a certain <a href=/people/1614 target=_blank>Arbaces</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> nationality, a virtuous stout-hearted man who was a general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a> who were sent each year to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Ninus' city</a>. In the course of his military duties, he became friendly with the commander-in-chief of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=demonym long=48 lat=35.5>Median</a> army, who beseeched him to overthrow the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> government. This is what <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a> relates in book two of the Historical Library. <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a> also mentions <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> rule. Here is what he says. </p>                        </div>

First <a href=/people/637 target=_blank>Hellanicus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=person long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a> and <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367274PKni class=person long=27.374 lat=36.6862>Cnidus</a>, followed by <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a> [have written about the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>]. The first of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> to rule over the Asians was <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>' son, <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>. During his reign many valorous deeds were done. Then he continues to discuss the birth of <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a> the Mage, war with the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a> and the military defeat by <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>' reign lasted for 52 years, and then he died. After him <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> ruled. It was she who built the walls around <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> in the manner described by many [writers such as] <br /><a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a>, <a href=/people/130 target=_blank>Zenon</a>, <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a> and others after him. <br />Then he describes how <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> mustered troops [and went] against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, her defeat and flight; how she killed her own sons and then was killed by her son <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a>, after a reign of 42 years. Then <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a> assumed power. <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a> says that he did nothing worthy of recall. Then he and others describe how for a thousand years power passed from father to son with none of them ruling for less than 20 years. Disliking warfare and strife they were effeminate, carefully keeping themselves fortified indoors, doing nothing, and seeing no one except their concubines or effeminate men. It seems to me that <a href=/people/485 target=_blank>Ctesias</a> records the names of some 23 of these kings, should someone want to know about them in more detail. But what pleasure or satisfaction would it bring to record the barbaric names of despicable, weak savages who displayed neither valor nor brave deeds? <br />[<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] says next that 640 years later, Belimus ruled over the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, [son] of <a href=/people/416 target=_blank>Danae</a> arrived in his land with 100 ships. He was escaping from <a href=/people/205 target=_blank>Semele</a>'s son, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>. After describing the defeat of <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> by <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, [<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] says that in later times, when Pannyas ruled over the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, the fleet of the <a href=/people/461 target=_blank>Argonauts</a> sailed up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/422417WPha class=place long=41.733 lat=42.171>Phasis</a> River to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400234PMen class=place long=23.419 lat=39.964>Mende</a>' in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a>. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> had [previously] left the ship out of his desire and longing for <a href=/people/1258 target=_blank>Hylas</a>. As they say, he wandered about seeking [<a href=/people/1258 target=_blank>Hylas</a>] in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>. <br />Furthermore [<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] says that 1000 years had elapsed from <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> to King Mitraeus. If one computes it, [the story of <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> and the period of King Mitreus] join up. [It was then] that <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> left King <a href=/people/399 target=_blank>Aegeus</a> [?<a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a>] of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a> out of lust [for <a href=/people/102 target=_blank>Jason</a>]. Her son was <a href=/people/1685 target=_blank>Medus</a>, whence <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, that is the [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> term] <br />Mark' (<a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>). Moreover that land is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=place long=48 lat=35.5>Media</a>, which is Marastan [in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=demonym long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a>]. [<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] says that Teutamus succeeded Mitraeus. The former also lived according to the customs and laws of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. Nothing new occurred during his reign. <br /><a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> and <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaeus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=ethnic long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenaeans</a>, mustered troops with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> and went against the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> while <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a> was general of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>. He said: The Greek troops which have come against me have reached your own land. We have engaged them in battle, sometimes winning, sometimes losing. But now, behold, my own son <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> has died among many other brave sons. Send us auxiliary troops under a courageous general. [<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] then describes in detail how Teutamus sent assistance to him under the generalship of <a href=/people/1491 target=_blank>Memnon</a>, <a href=/people/5362 target=_blank>Tithonus</a>' son. However, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a> (T'eghaghats'ik) treacherously killed him. In another passage [<a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalion</a>] says that <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a> became king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> in the 1,013 th year; and then he describes his destruction. After the death of <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapallus</a>, (V)<a href=/people/1614 target=_blank>Arbaces</a> the Mede, destroyed the power of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> and transferred rule to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>.

The fact that the Hebrew people derived from the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> was clearly demonstrated, since <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> and his ancestors inhabited that land. Moreover, the Mosaic writings confirm this [in the following passage [Genesis 11.31]]: Terah took <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarah his daughter-in-law, his son <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>'s wife, and they went forth together from the land of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>. <br />Thus it is fitting that the history of Hebrew antiquities follow our exposition of <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> history. The story they relate about the flood is quite different from the Greek legendary tale which places the flood during the time of <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>, [an event which occurred] long before <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a> and the great flood which the Greeks say occurred in his time. The flood [recounted in Genesis] took place some 1,200 years before <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a>' flood, which in turn preceded <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>'s flood by 250 years. <br />There are not a few similarities between the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> and Hebrew writings about the flood. [For example] they [both] say that there were ten successive generations before the flood. <br />After the flood, the human race throughout the entire world was fathered by [only] three men. All Europe, from Mt. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371366LAma class=place long=36.617 lat=37.1408>Amanus</a> to the western ocean, descended from Japheth. [The people of] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, and all points westward descended from Ham. The third brother, Shem, fathered [the inhabitants of] <br /><a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> and all points eastward. <br />Hebrew scriptures regard Nimrod as the first builder of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, describing [the matter] in this way [in Genesis 10.8-11]: Cush became the father of Nimrod. Cush was an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> who was considered the father of Nimrod, about whom scripture says: He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord'. The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar. From that land he went into <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> and built <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>, which is called <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> [in Greek], was the first royal city of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. It was built by Asshur, one of the sons of Shem, who, as we said held all the eastern areas. <br />They say that the sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Aram, and Lud. The Elamites, the first nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, descended from Elam, who also built the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405500RSus class=place long=50 lat=40.5>Elymais</a>. the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> descended from Asshur who also built the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> city, <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, which was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>. The Arphaxadians descended from Arphaxad also called <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a>. The Aramaeans, also called Syrians (Asorik'), descended from Aram. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> descended from Lud. Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, who was the father of Eber, from whom the name and nation of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> derives. <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, the patriarch of the Hebrew nation, was the sixth generation descendant of Eber, in the tenth generation after the flood. This much should be sufficient to demonstrate in summary fashion that the ancestry of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldeans</a> and <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> is mixed with that of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>. Consequently it is appropriate to begin their [Hebrew] chronology close to those others. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2018.tlg040:23'><b>&sect; 23</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Their chronology commences with an account of the fall from grace of our human race. This occurred during the time of <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>, the first patriarch, whose name is synonymous with human kind, since in the Hebrew language <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> means, generally, man. The period of his life after his expulsion from Paradise has been recorded by <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, through the agency of the Holy Spirit. <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> then lists [<a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>'s] descendants and their ages through successive generations [Genesis 5.1-32]. Because of this we can set down a chronology of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> from him. But no one can determine when it was that [<a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>] dwelled in that Paradise described in the Bible. It seems to me that the marvelous <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> alludes to a goodly, godly existence then in a world better than our own, a place called Paradise where the first man dwelled. [<a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>] refers to all of humanity when he describes <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>'s sweet and desirable existence in Paradise. <br />Our chronicle will not provide accounts about that existence [in Paradise] nor about how the Almighty established heaven and earth. This is how some [chroniclers] have thought [to begin]. Rather, we shall begin from the time that our human race experienced mortality and from [the time of] our first ancestor who set out on that path. [That ancestor] was the man named <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>, whose dying, mortal span of years was calculated in Hebrew literature, for it was from this point that Hebrew chronology began. Indeed, the Book of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> [Genesis 3.23] describes it as follows: <br />The Lord God sent him (that is, the first man) forth from the garden of <a href=/people/7626 target=_blank>Eden</a>, to till the ground from which he was taken. And he drove <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> out and made him live outside the comforts of Paradise. Further on it says [Genesis 4.1]: Now <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> knew <a href=/people/5662 target=_blank>Eve</a> his wife and she conceived and bore Cain. Our present chronology will begin at this point. The history of earlier, unknowable times will be set aside here, because it should be kept distinct from subsequent [verifiable] history. <br />There is considerable disagreement among the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> about their own chronology, so it will be good to commence by examining their differing accounts. By evaluating and comparing all of them, the truth will be arrived at. The five books of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> describe the creation of the world, life before the flood, the history of the ancients after the flood, the generations of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, and the passing of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>. The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a>, who were foreigners who came to live among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, have differing versions of the books of the law. The characters of the Hebrew alphabet used by the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> differ from those used by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a>. <br />The correct and original [alphabet] is not the one used by the [contemporary] <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, because their descendants corrupted it. Yet there was no conflict between them [the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a>] until the alteration of the letters. Furthermore there are numerous disagreements between the two with respect to chronology, as will become clear in the comparison below. <br />The Greek translation [of the Bible] also differs from the Hebrew, though not so much from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=demonym long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritan</a> [version]. There is disagreement [in chronology in the versions] up to the flood, but thereafter, until the time of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, the versions are in harmony. The text we use was translated collectively by seventy Hebrew men from their language into Greek during the reign of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemaeus</a> <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>. [Their translation] was placed in the library in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, where it was carefully preserved. Now we shall set forth historical information from each of the versions, one after the other, so that it will be easy to distinguish the discrepancies. We shall begin with the translation of the seventy men [the Greek Septuagint] and see how it treats the chronology of the period from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> to the birth of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>. </p>                        </div>

Methusaleh fathered <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a> when he was 167 years of age. He lived an additional 802 years. Thus he would have survived the flood by 22 years.

He lived an additional 807 years, until the 168th year of <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a>. <br />3. Enosh fathered Kenan when he was 90 years of age. He lived an additional 815 years, until the 84th year of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>. <br />4. Kenan fathered Mahalalel when he was 70 years of age. He lived an additional 840 years, until the 179th year of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>. <br />5. Mahalalel fathered Jared when he was 65 years of age. He lived an additional 830 years, until the 234th year of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>. <br />6. Jared fathered <a href=/people/3590 target=_blank>Enoch</a> when he was 162 years of age. He lived an additional 800 years, until the 366th year of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>. <br />7. <a href=/people/3590 target=_blank>Enoch</a> fathered Methusaleh when he was 65 years of age. He lived an additional 300 years until he was translated in the 113th year of <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a>. <br />8. Methusaleh fathered <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a> when he was 187 years of age. He lived an additional 782 years, until the [time of the] flood. <br />9. <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a> fathered <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> when he was 182 years of age. He lived an additional 595 years, dying five years before the flood. <br />10. <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> fathered Shem, Ham and Japheth when he was 500 years of age, 100 years before the flood. The flood occurred in the 600th year of <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>. He lived an additional 350 years after the flood, until the 58th year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>. The total sum [for this version] is 1656 years. <br />There is a 586 year discrepancy between this version and the Septuagint. The difference is in the number of years each man from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> to <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> lived before fathering children. [The versions agree] only for the times of Jared, Methusaleh, and <a href=/people/2420 target=_blank>Lamech</a>. This circumstance suggests to us that the text which we use [i.e. the Septuagint] is the best. From the longer period assigned to Jared and his descendants [in the Hebrew version] it is clear that the periods of their predecessors, similarly, should be the same as in the Septuagint version. By adding one hundred years the discrepancy observed between the later and more recent generations in the Hebrew and the Septuagint versions is eliminated. [We might suggest] the possibility that the descendants lived longer than their ancestors. Yet for each man's life, the number of years before his son was born, and the number of year that he lived afterwards, added together, produces the same total in the Hebrew version and the Septuagint. It is only the number of years before their sons were born which is shorter in the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> copies. Therefore we suspect that this was something which the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> did. They made bold to shorten the time before the fathering of children to encourage early marriages. For if these ancestors lived such long lives, marrying early and fathering children early as their version clearly states, who would not want to emulate them by marrying early? <br />The Hebrew version of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=ethnic long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritans</a>. </p>                        </div>

If, according to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> scriptures, there were 292 years from the flood until <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, and <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> lived an additional 350 years after the flood, it is clear that <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> was alive until the 58th year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>. <br />Furthermore it is possible to show that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> version is unreliable in another way, because it says that the generations before <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> were about 30 years old when they fathered sons, while it makes the generations after <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> considerably older when they fathered sons. <br />Thus it is patently clear that the Septuagint was translated from old and accurate Hebrew copies, and is the most appropriate text for us to use in our present Chronicle, especially since the church of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, which has spread throughout the world, supports only this version and since the apostles and disciples of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> used and transmitted this version. In the Septuagint [version], 2,242 years transpired from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> until the flood, and 942 years transpired from the flood until the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, making a total of 3,184 years. <br />In the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> Hebrew [version], 1,656 years transpired from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> until the flood, and 292 years transpired from the flood until the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, making a total of 1,948 years. <br />In the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=demonym long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritan</a> Hebrew [version], 1,307 years transpired from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> until the flood, and 942 years transpired from the flood until the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, making a total of 2,249 years. <br />All versions agree that 505 years transpired from <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> until <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and the exodus of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. It is calculated as follows. When <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was 75 years of age, God appeared to him and said that He would give the promised land to his descendants. For it is written [in Genesis, 12.4-5]: <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. And <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> took Sarah his wife, and Lot his brother's son. In the same passage, further on [Genesis, 12.7] it states: Then the Lord appeared to <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> and said: <br />'To your descendants I will give this land.' Thus [we calculate] 75 years [in the life] of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> plus 430 years [from God's promise] until the exodus of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. The Apostle Paul confirms this [in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=ethnic long=33 lat=40.1>Galatians</a>, 3.17-18]: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. Then he adds: God gave it to <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> by a promise. When <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was 100 years of age his son <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> was born, 25 years after God's promise. Four hundred and five years transpired from that event until the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Consequently, from the promise [until the exodus] 430 years elapsed. <br />Now God appeared to <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> a second time and said [Genesis, 15.13]: Know of a surety that your descendants will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there, and they will be oppressed for four hundred years. The word descendants is used deliberately so that we not allocate the entire period [solely] to <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a>. Moreover the period of 430 years is mentioned again at the time of the exodus of the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, [Exodus, 12.40-41]: They and their forefathers dwelled in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and the land of Canaan for 430 years. And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> at night. Since the period from God's God's promise in the 75th year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> is 430 years, it is clear that 505 years elapsed from the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> to the time of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. Some [authors] have presented [this material] in detail, as follows: <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> fathered <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> at the age of 100. <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> fathered <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> at the age of 60. <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> fathered <a href=/people/3415 target=_blank>Levi</a> at the age of 86. <br /><a href=/people/3415 target=_blank>Levi</a> fathered Kohath at the age of 46. Kohath fathered Amran at the age of 63. Amran fathered <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> at the age of 70. <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> led his people out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> when he was 80 years old. Thus from the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> until the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, a total of 505 years transpired. According to the Septuagint, the total from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> to the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> is 3,689 years; according to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> [Hebrew version], 2,453 years; and according to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/322351USeb class=demonym long=35.1904 lat=32.2765>Samaritan</a> [Hebrew version], 2,753 years. </p>                        </div>

The book of Judges, as well as the blessed Apostle Paul in Acts of the Apostles calculate it one way, while the book of Kings and Hebrew tradition calculate it another way. It will be best to describe both and then select [the account] which proves truest. <br />First, however, we must pause to criticize <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, who wrote a five-book Chronology. It seems to me that he is greatly in error regarding the matter before us. From the exodus of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> to [the time of] <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> [<a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>], through his own unique calculations assigns 744 years, mostly without any citations, and not only contrary to what is recorded in Scripture, but even audaciously adding an extra hundred years on his own. [<a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>] inserts an additional 30 years after <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a>, for the elders. Then, after <a href=/people/4678 target=_blank>Samson</a>, he adds 40 years of anarchy and another 30 years of peace. By adding these additional years without any proof, he creates an inflated total of more than 740 years for the period between <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and the reign of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. <br />To see the fanciful nature of his calculations, we have to observe the preceding generations and their lengths. <br />From <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> to <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> there were 14 generations, and the eleventh generation had already ended at the time of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, when Nahshon the son of Aminadab was recognized as the prince of the nation of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>. <br />Nahshon died in the desert after leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and he was present when the people were first counted. It is clear that there were five generations from Nahshon to <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>: <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Nahshon. So on what grounds can it be claimed that the five generations after <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> endured for more than 700 years? If the years for men of each generation are evenly divided, we find that each one lived for 140 years before fathering a son, something that no rational person would accept as probable. For <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> himself died at 120 years of age, and his successor, <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a>, died at 110 years of age. Before them Joseph lived a total of 110 years, and earlier still <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>, who was also called <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, the patriarch of all the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, lived for 147 years. <br />Consequently, how could anyone claim that in the period after <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> anyone could have lived as long as we mentioned above? This is the error that <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> made. <a href=/people/2509 target=_blank>Clemens</a>, however, calculated 574 years from <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>' successor <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> until the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, in his first book [Stromata 1.21]. The blessed Apostle Paul in his speech to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> in the Acts of the Apostles [13.19-22] states: <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> destroyed seven nations in the land of the Canaanites, and he gave them their land as an inheritance. And after 450 years he gave them judges until the time of <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> the prophet. Then they asked for a king, and [God] gave them Saul the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for 40 years. Afterwards [God] removed Saul and gave them <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> in his place. <br />That is what the Apostle says. He calculated 534 years after <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> in addition to the 450 years for the judges until <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a>. Add to this 40 years for Saul, another 40 years for <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>, and the four years of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>'s reign before the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, which makes a total of 534 years from <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> the successor of <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> until <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>. According to the Apostle by adding the 40 years <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> spent in the wilderness, and the 27 years of <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> the son of Nun, the total for the entire period will be 600 years. The book of Judges is in agreement with his account, and calculates 450 years to the judges until <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a>, which are divided up as follows: </p>                        </div>

Moreover, if the 40 years of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> and the 4 years of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> are included, the total reaches 534 years — exactly what the Apostle indicated.

Taking the total [of 600 years] and dividing it equally among the generations, we find that the men lived for more than 115 years before becoming fathers, an unbelievable proposition.

According to the Hebrew version, it was 480 years. <br />The third book of Kings [1 Kings, 6.1] states: It happened in the 440th year after the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, that <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> began building the house of the Lord. The Hebrew version says: It happened in the 480th year. <br />This is because the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> doctors [of the faith] calculated that the total figure was 480 years, since they did not count the years that the foreigners ruled over the people separately. They just counted the time that the judges ruled them and included the foreign domination in that figure. This must have been the case, for it is the only way to arrive at a total of 480 years. It seems to me that when the blessed Apostle stated the number of years as mentioned earlier, he was not speaking as a chronographer, or someone trying to make a precise calculation. He was delivering a sermon on salvation. It would have been inappropriate to insert into it a treatise on chronological methodology, and so he followed the popular interpretation of the book of Judges. <br />The book of Kings clearly states that [the period] from the exodus until [the time of] <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> embraced 440 or 480 years. However, if we examine the years for each of the judges individually and also tally the years of foreign rule separately — as mentioned in the book of Judges — we find 600 years total between <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>: <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> was in the wilderness for 40 years. <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a>, 27 years. Judges and foreigners, 450 years. This is what the Apostle states, according to the book of Judges. <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> and Saul, 40 years. <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>, 40 years. <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> 4 years, until the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. Accordingly, each of the men in the five generations just mentioned must have lived 120 years before fathering a son, a wholly preposterous proposition. <br />If we follow the book of Kings, we get a total of 480 years, after subtracting the 120 years of the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>' servitude. The <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> themselves reckon it this way, combining their years of servitude to foreigners with the years of their freedom. We shall do the same in our Chronicle, incorporating the period of foreign servitude with the number of years assigned to each [of the judges] in the book of Kings. [This method] is especially [persuasive] concerning the five generations from Nahshon to <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>. By subtracting from the total of 480 years the 40 years <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> spent in the wilderness and the four years of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, 436 years remain to the death of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>. Dividing these years equally among the five generations, produces 87 years for each generation. Should people investigate this, they will find a credible account beginning with the birth of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>. <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> was born when his father Jesse was an old man. <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> was the eighth son born after his seven older brothers. Consequently we can assume that something similar happened to his ancestors. <br />Thus, for our purposes, we will accept that 480 years elapsed from the exodus from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> until <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the construction of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. And we will include the years of foreign rule within the reigns of each successive judge. Now it happens that this decision is supported by a statement in the book of Judges made by Jephthah, one of the judges of the people. When the Ammonites who lived on the far side of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a> River started a war with him, [Jephthah] sent a messenger to the enemy with this import [Judges 11.25-26]: <br />Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of <a href=/people/5799 target=_blank>Moab</a>? Did he ever strive against <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, or did he ever go to war with them? While <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> dwelt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318358UEsb class=place long=35.809 lat=31.8006>Heshbon</a> and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a>, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time? Thus [Jephthah] informed them that <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and Balak, son of Zippor, lived 300 years before their period. The 300 year total can only be obtained by including the period of the rule by foreigners within the reigns of the judges. <br />Should someone tally the years of servitude to foreigners separately, he will obtain a figure which far exceeds the 300 years. Yet if only the years of the judges' rule are counted, then he will discover 300 years between <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and Jephthah, exactly as Jephthah's message stated. Consequently we will adopt the following chronology in this work: </p>                        </div>

The first book of Kings [1 <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> 13.1] describes it this way: Saul was the son of a year in his reign; and he ruled over <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> for two years more. <a href=/people/1720 target=_blank>Symmachus</a> clarifies this in his translation: Saul resembled a one-year-old child in his reigning, which means that at the beginning of his reign Saul was sincere and good, and stayed that way for two years. But then he became corrupted and was rejected by God and was strangled by a demon in punishment. Thus the remaining years have been assigned to <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> and 40 years is the combined total for <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> and Saul. It is clear that Saul ruled for this period not solely based on the testimony of the Apostle, but through a careful reading of Scripture. <br />It is written [in 2 <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> 2.10] that following Saul's death, Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was 40 years old when he began to reign over <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, and he reigned two years. But the house of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> followed <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>. The Ish-bosheth mentioned here must have been born after Saul became king, because when describing events from the beginning of Saul's reign [1 <a href=/people/1716 target=_blank>Samuel</a> 14.49], mention is made of three sons of Saul, but not this one. Thus we believe that [Ish-bosheth] was born late, and that the length of Saul's reign was approximately the same as the age of his son following his death. <br />Thus, the third book of Kings [1 Kings 6.1] states that 480 years elapsed from the exodus out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> until <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>; 505 years elapsed from <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> until <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and the exodus; 942 years elapsed from the flood until the first year of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>; and 2,242 years elapsed from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> until the flood. Altogether 4,170 years elapsed from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> until <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the building of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. <br />The historian <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a> in the first book of his <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> Antiquities when describing the time of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> and the construction of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> includes the testimony of some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> men. The evidence of these men seems valuable to me.

There are then records among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> that take in the history of many years, and these are public writings, and are kept with great exactness, and include accounts of the facts done among them, and such as concern their transactions with other nations also, those I mean which were worth remembering. Therein it was recorded that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was built by king <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, one hundred forty-three years and eight months before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> built <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>. <br />In their annals the building of our <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> is related; for Hirom, the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, was the friend of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> our king, and had such friendship transmitted down to him from his forefathers. He thereupon was ambitious to contribute to the splendor of this edifice of <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, and made him a present of one hundred and twenty talents of gold. He also cut down the most excellent timber out of that mountain which is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>, and sent it to him for adorning its roof. <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> also not only made him many other presents, by way of requital, but gave him a country in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328353RGal class=place long=35.25 lat=32.8>Galilee</a> also, that was called Chabulon. But there was another passion, a philosophic inclination of theirs, which cemented the friendship that was betwixt them; for they sent mutual problems to one another, with a desire to have them unriddled by each other; wherein <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> was superior to Hirom, as he was wiser than him in other respects: and many of the epistles that passed between them are still preserved among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a>. Now, that this may not depend on my bare word, I will produce for a witness <a href=/people/1654 target=_blank>Dius</a>, one that is believed to have written the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=demonym long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenician</a> History after an accurate manner. This <a href=/people/1654 target=_blank>Dius</a>, therefore, writes thus, in his Histories of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=ethnic long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicians</a>: <br />Upon the death of Abibalus, his son Hirom took the kingdom. This king raised banks at the eastern parts of the city, and enlarged it; he also joined the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter Olympius</a> (Aramazd), which stood before in an island by itself, to the city, by raising a causeway between them, and adorned that temple with donations of gold. He moreover went up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>, and had timber cut down for the building of temples. They say further, that <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, when he was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, sent problems to Hirom to be solved, and desired he would send others back for him to solve, and that he who could not solve the problems proposed to him should pay money to him that solved them. And when Hirom had agreed to the proposals, but was not able to solve the problems, he was obliged to pay a great deal of money, as a penalty for the same. As also they relate, that one Abdemon, a man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, did solve the problems, and proposed others which <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> could not solve, upon which he was obliged to repay a great deal of money to Hirom. </p>                        </div>

This <a href=/people/156 target=_blank>Menander</a> wrote the Acts that were done both by the Greeks and Barbarians, under every one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=demonym long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrian</a> kings, and had taken much pains to learn their history out of their own records. Now when he was writing about those kings that had reigned at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, he came to Hirom, and says thus: <br />Upon the death of Abibalus, his son Hirom took the kingdom; he lived fifty-three years, and reigned thirty-four. He raised a bank on that called the Broad Place, and dedicated that golden pillar which is in <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>'s (Aramazd) temple; he also went and cut down timber from the mountain called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/339358LLib class=place long=35.765 lat=33.925>Libanus</a>, and got timber of cedar for the roofs of the temples. He also pulled down the old temples, and built new ones; besides this, he consecrated the temples of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> and of <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a>. He first built <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>'s temple in the month Peritus, and that of <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a> when he made his expedition against the Tityans, who would not pay him their tribute; and when he had subdued them to himself, he returned home. Under this king there was a younger son of Abdemon, who mastered the problems which <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, had recommended to be solved. Now the time from this king to the building of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> is thus calculated: <br />Upon the death of Hirom, Baleazarus his son took the kingdom; he lived forty-three years, and reigned seven years: after him succeeded his son Abdastartus; he lived twenty-nine years, and reigned nine years. Now four sons of his nurse plotted against him and slew him, the eldest of whom reigned [twelve years]: after them came Astartus, the son of Deleastartus; he lived fifty-four years, and reigned twelve years: after him came his brother Aserymus; he lived fifty-four years, and reigned nine years: he was slain by his brother Pheles, who took the kingdom and reigned but eight months, though he lived fifty years: he was slain by Ithobalus, the priest of <a href=/people/2495 target=_blank>Astarte</a>, who reigned thirty-two years, and lived sixty-eight years: he was succeeded by his son Badezorus, who lived forty-five years, and reigned six years: he was succeeded by Matgenus his son; he lived thirty-two years, and reigned nine years: <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a> succeeded him; he lived fifty-six years, and reigned forty-seven years. Now in the seventh year of his reign, his sister fled away from him, and built the city <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>. So the whole time from the reign of Hirom, till the building of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, amounts to the sum of one hundred fifty-five years and eight months.

For in the second year of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> he wrote [Zechariah 1.12]: God Almighty, how long wilt thou have no mercy on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> and the cities of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years? <br />At this point one might inquire: Why does it state in the beginning of the book of Ezra [1.1]: In the first year of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a> might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing. Furthermore, subsequent [passages] indicate that freedom [was given] to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> [at that point] and that it was <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> who ordered that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> be rebuilt. From this one would assume that it was during the time of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, rather than <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, that the 70 years of captivity came to an end. <br />To this I reply that the prophecies refer to two [distinct] 70-year periods. The first began with the destruction of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> and ended, as Zechariah stated, in the second year of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>. The second extends from the enslavement of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> to the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> and the destruction of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldean</a> kingdom. This began in the time of the prophecy and ended with <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, as <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a> recorded. [<a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>] further predicted [<a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a> 29.10]: For thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, I will visit you, and I will fulfil to you my promise and bring you back to this place.

The last god to rule there was <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a>, <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>' son. Then humans ruled that land as kings, they say, during the time of Myris. And this has continued for somewhat less than 5,000 years, through the 180th Olympiad [60-57 B.C.], when we visited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. At that time, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called the New <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, was ruling. <br />For most of this period, [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>'] own kings ruled the land. However, for a small portion [of time], <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=ethnic long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> [ruled]. Only four <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=demonym long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopian</a> [kings] ruled, and not contiguously at that, rather, [they ruled] at separate times, and for a total of slightly less than 36 years. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> domination was established by <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a> who forcibly subdued [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>]. [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> rule] lasted for 135 years and was ended by the rebellion of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> when they could no longer bear the harshness of [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>] rule and the insults to their country's gods. After this the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> and their descendants ruled for 276 years. For all the rest of the time native kings ruled, 470 kings and 5 queens. <br />The priests kept records ahout all of them in their temple archives, which were transmitted continuously from ancient times from generation to generation. They described each one's bravery and valor, personality and triumphs, and whatever else they accomplished in their periods. However it is unnecessary and even pointless for us to write down what each one wrought, since some of them, even in their own day, were considered useless. <br />This according to <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>.

He was succeeded by the Sun (Arm. Aregakn), (who was succeeded by <a href=/people/10761 target=_blank>Agathodaemon</a>, followed) by <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a>, followed by <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>. Then came <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a>' brother, then <a href=/people/920 target=_blank>Horus</a>, who was the son of <a href=/people/187 target=_blank>Osiris</a> and <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>. These [entities] were the first rulers of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. After them, one ruler succeeded the next until the time of <a href=/people/3003 target=_blank>Bidis</a>, for a period of 13,900 years. This [was calculated] as lunar years of 30 days each, for what we now call a month was called a year in those days. <br />After rule by the gods, a race descended from the gods ruled for 1,255 years. Then other kings ruled for 1,817 years. After them 30 kings from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a> ruled for 1,790 years. Then 10 other kings, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/263318UThi class=place long=31.8419 lat=26.3415>Thinis</a>, ruled for 350 years. Then, for 5,813 years, the kings were spirits and demi-gods. This makes a total of 11,000 years — lunar years, that is, months. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> calculate a total of 24,900 lunar years — 2,206 solar years-to the [rule of the] gods, demi-gods, and spirits. If you compare this [calculation] with [similar calculations of] Hebrew chronology you will get almost the same figure. For among the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> <a href=/people/1582 target=_blank>Aegyptus</a> is called Mizraim, and he lived a long time after the flood. Because it was after the flood that <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>'s son Ham became the father of <a href=/people/1582 target=_blank>Aegyptus</a>, or Mizraim; and at the time of the dispersal of the peoples, he went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, as its first inhabitant. According to the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> 2,242 years elapsed from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a> to the flood. <br />Be this as it may, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> still boast of their great antiquity before the flood. They say that they had gods, demi-gods, and spirits [as rulers in remote antiquity]. If we convert to months the years calculated by the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a>, we get over 20,000 lunar years. So when we count the years from the first man [<a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>] until Mizraim, the Hebrew calculation is approximately the same [as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a>]. Mizraim was first among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, and the first dynasty is presumed to descend from him. <br />Despite this, if the number of years seems excessive, we must examine the reasons for it. It is conceivable that there were many kings ruling in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> simultaneously. For they say that [kings from] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/263318UThi class=place long=31.8419 lat=26.3415>Thinis</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/309307USai class=place long=30.7693 lat=30.9666>Sais</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> and elsewhere ruled. It may be that these dynasties did not rule in succession to each other, as is the norm, but in different places at the same time. As a consequence of this, the total number [of kings] is very large. Let us leave this issue, however, and move on to the details of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> chronology. <br />After the [period of] spirits and demi-gods, the First Dynasty appeared, consisting of 8 kings. The first and most noble of them was Menes. Beginning with him, we shall list the succession of kings from each generation. </p>                        </div>

Now this <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a>, in the first book of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> History, writes concerning us in the following manner. <br />I will set down his very words, as if I were to bring the very man himself into a court for a witness: [There was a king of ours whose name was Timaus. Under him] it came to pass, I know not how, that God was averse to us, and there came, after a surprising manner, men of ignoble birth out of the eastern parts, and had boldness enough to make an expedition into our country, and with ease subdued it by force, yet without our hazarding a battle with them. So when they had gotten those that governed us under their power, they afterwards burnt down our cities, and demolished the temples of the gods, and used all the inhabitants after a most barbarous manner; nay, some they slew, and led their children and their wives into slavery. At length they made one of themselves king, whose name was Salatis; he also lived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/298313PMem class=place long=31.255 lat=29.849>Memphis</a>, and made both the upper and lower regions pay tribute, and left garrisons in places that were the most proper for them. He chiefly aimed to secure the eastern parts, as foreseeing that the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, who had then the greatest power, would be desirous of that kingdom, and invade them; and as he found in the Saite Nomos, [Sethroite,] a city very proper for this purpose, and which lay upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/306315UBub class=demonym long=31.512 lat=30.572>Bubastic</a> channel, but with regard to a certain theologic notion was called Avaris, this he rebuilt, and made very strong by the walls he built about it, and by a most numerous garrison of two hundred and forty thousand armed men whom he put into it to keep it. Thither Salatis came in summer time, partly to [gather his corn, and] pay his soldiers their wages, and partly to exercise his armed men, and thereby to terrify foreigners. This man reigned for fifteen and then died. </p>                        </div>

This whole nation was styled Hyksos, that is, Shepherd-kings: for the first syllable Hyk, according to the sacred dialect, denotes a king, as is sos a shepherd; but this according to the ordinary dialect; and of these is compounded Hyksos: but some say that these people were <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>.

[But <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a> goes on]: These people, whom we have before named kings, and called shepherds also, and their descendants, as he says, kept possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> five hundred and eleven years. <br />After these, he says, That the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/262327UThe class=place long=32.75 lat=26.25>Thebais</a> and the other parts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> made an insurrection against the shepherds, and that there a terrible and long war was made between them.

And this account of his is the truth; for feeding of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> was the employment of our forefathers in the most ancient ages and as they led such a wandering life in feeding <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, they were called Shepherds. Nor was it without reason that they were called Captives by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, since one of our ancestors, Joseph, told the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> that he was a captive, and afterward sent for his brethren into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by the king's permission. But as for these matters, I shall make a more exact inquiry about them elsewhere. <br />But now I shall produce the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> as witnesses to the antiquity of our nation. I shall therefore here bring in <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a> again, and what he writes as to the order of the times in this case; and thus he speaks: When this people or shepherds were gone out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, Tethtmosis the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, who drove them out, reigned afterward twenty-five years and four months, and then died; after him his son Chebron took the kingdom for thirteen years; after whom came Amenophis, for twenty years and seven months; then came his sister Amesses, for twenty-one years and nine months; after her came Mephres, his son, for twelve years and nine months; after him was Mephramuthosis, for twenty-five years and ten months; after him was Thmosis, for nine years and eight months; after him came Amenophis, for thirty years and ten months; after him came <a href=/people/2135 target=_blank>Orus</a>, for thirty-six years and five months; then came his daughter Acenchres, for twelve years and one month; then was her brother Rathotis, for nine years; then was Acencheres, for twelve years and five months; then came another Acencheres, for twelve years and three months; after him Armais, for four years and one month; after him was Ramesses, for one year and four months; after him came Armesses Miammoun, for sixty-six years and two months; after him Amenophis, for nineteen years and six months; after him came Sethosis, and Ramesses, who had an army of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and a naval force. This king appointed his brother, Armais,, to be his deputy over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. He also gave him all the other authority of a king, but with these only injunctions, that he should not wear the diadem, nor be injurious to the queen, the mother of his children, and that he should not meddle with the other concubines of the king; while he made an expedition against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho class=place long=35.4 lat=33.5>Phoenicia</a>, and besides against the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>. He then subdued them all, some by his arms, some without fighting, and some by the terror of his great army; and being puffed up by the great successes he had had, he went on still the more boldly, and overthrew the cities and countries that lay in the eastern parts. But after some considerable time, Armais, who was left in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, did all those very things, by way of opposition, which his brother had forbid him to do, without fear; for he used violence to the queen, and continued to make use of the rest of the concubines, without sparing any of them; nay, at the persuasion of his friends he put on the diadem, and set up to oppose his brother. But then he who was set over the priests of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> wrote letters to Sethosis, and informed him of all that had happened, and how his brother had set up to oppose him: he therefore returned back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a> immediately, and recovered his kingdom again. The country also was called from his name <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; for <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a> says, that Sethosis was himself called <a href=/people/1155 target=_blank>Egyptus</a>, as was his brother Armais called <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a>. </p>                        </div>

And it is evident from the number of years set down by him belonging to this interval, if they be summed up together, that these shepherds, as they are here called, who were no other than our forefathers, were delivered out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and came thence, and inhabited this country, three hundred and ninety-three years before <a href=/people/303 target=_blank>Danaus</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>; although the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> look upon him as their most ancient king <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a>, therefore, bears this testimony to two points of the greatest consequence to our purpose, and those from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> records themselves. In the first place, that we came out of another country into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; and that withal our deliverance out of it was so ancient in time as to have preceded the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> by almost a thousand years; but then, as to those things which <a href=/people/1448 target=_blank>Manetho</a> adds, not from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> records, but, as he confesses himself, from some stories of an uncertain origin, I will disprove them hereafter particularly, and shall demonstrate that they are no better than incredible fables. <br />This is what <a href=/people/1222 target=_blank>Josephus</a> relates in his book. One by one he names the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and their chonologies starting at the beginning and continuing until the period of the one named <a href=/people/4227 target=_blank>Nectanebus</a>. I have already mentioned <a href=/people/4227 target=_blank>Nectanebus</a> previously in the list of kings. After <a href=/people/4227 target=_blank>Nectanebus</a>, <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a> the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> gained control of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and ruled for 6 years. Then Arses, <a href=/people/748 target=_blank>Ochus</a>' son, ruled for 4 years. After him, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> ruled for 6 years. Then <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> killed <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>, and ruled over both the Asians and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> founded the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the sixth year of his reign. After the death of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, his empire was divided between many different rulers, and the <a href=/people/1790 target=_blank>Ptolemies</a> became kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>.

From the writings of <a href=/people/1320 target=_blank>Porphyrius</a>. <br /><a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=person long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedon</a> [died] in the 114th Olympiad [324 B.C.]. He was succeeded by <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a>, also called <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s brother by a different mother. For he was the son of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> and <a href=/people/2914 target=_blank>Philinna</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=person long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larissa</a>. This <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a> ruled for 7 years. He was killed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> by <a href=/people/1140 target=_blank>Polysperchon</a> the son of <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>. <br />A year after <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> took power, <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> the son of <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a> and <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a> was sent to be governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. He was governor for 17 years, and then he was king for 23 years. Thus he ruled for 40 years, until his death. However, while still alive he abdicated in favour of his son <a href=/people/8222 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>, and he lived for a further two years after his son had become king. Consequently the reign of this first <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a>, we take to be 38 rather than 40 years. <br />He was succeeded by his son <a href=/people/8222 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, who as we said was called <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>. The son reigned for two years while his father was still alive, and then for an additional 36 years, so we consider his reign to have lasted 38 years, the same as his father's. <br />He was succeeded by the third <a href=/people/2014 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/2014 target=_blank>Euergetes</a>, who reigned for 25 years. <br />He was succeeded by the fourth <a href=/people/10150 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/1172 target=_blank>Philopator</a>, who reigned for 17 years. <br />He was succeeded by the fifth <a href=/people/11087 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a>, who reigned for 24 years. <br />The latter was succeeded by his two sons. The elder was called Philometer and the younger, <a href=/people/2310 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> the second. Their combined reigns totaled 61 years. We present their reigns as one due to the confusion of the period, since they were perpetually at war with each, and one was always seizing the throne from the other. <br />First <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a> ruled for 11 years; but when <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> invaded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and removed him from the throne, the inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> put the younger brother on the throne, forced <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and freed <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>. They called that the 12th year of <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>, and the first year of <a href=/people/2310 target=_blank>Euergetes</a>. After that the two kings ruled jointly until the 17th year, but from the 18th year onwards <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a> ruled on his own. <br />Then the elder brother, who had recently been deposed by the younger brother, was restored by the Romans. So he ruled over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and gave the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> to his younger brother. [<a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>] ruled [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>] alone for 18 years. He died in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, which was also under his rule. At that point <a href=/people/2310 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> was called back from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/328219PCyr class=place long=21.856 lat=32.819>Cyrene</a> and named king. <a href=/people/2310 target=_blank>Euergetes</a> counted his years from the time he first became king, so he seems to have reigned for 25 years after his brother's death, but officially he reigned for 54 years. The 36th year of <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a> should have been called the first year of his reign, but instead he ordered it to be written as the 25th year of his reign. So the combined length of both their reigns is 64 years, 35 years under <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a> and the rest under <a href=/people/2310 target=_blank>Euergetes</a>. Dividing it up into separate reigns would lead to confusion. </p>                        </div>

First the elder son was brought to the throne by his mother. She thought he would obey her, so favoured him for a time. But in the sixth year of his reign he murdered his parents' friends. His mother removed him from power because of his cruelty, and he fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. <br />His mother summoned her younger son from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/310325UPel class=place long=32.5462 lat=31.0424>Pelusium</a>, and appointed him joint monarch with her. <br />Thus the younger son and his mother ruled together and the country was governed in both their names. This year was called the 11th year of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> and the 8th year of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, because <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> counted his years from the 4th year of his brother's reign, which was when he started to rule over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. Thus matters continued until the death of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>. After she died, <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> ruled as the sole monarch, reigning for a total of 18 years after he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, though officially he reigned for 26 years. In the 19th year, after a dispute with his soldiers, he went away to collect an army to bring to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> against them. However they pursued him, and under the leadership of Tyrrus, who was a relative of the kings, they defeated him in a naval battle. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> escaped by a hairsbreadth and took refuge with his wife and daughter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363300UMyr class=place long=29.9853 lat=36.259>Myra</a>, a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a>; from there, he crossed over to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, where he was defeated by the admiral <a href=/people/2851 target=_blank>Chaereas</a>, and died. <br />After [<a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s] flight, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=ethnic long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrians</a> sent an emissary to his elder brother, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a>, once more giving the throne to him, when he would sail back from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. He lived another 7 years and 6 months after his return. The entire period after the death of the brothers' father was counted in his name, which was a total of 35 years and 6 months. But if we divide the period precisely, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a> ruled at two different times for a total of 17 years and 6 months, and in between the younger brother, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, ruled for 18 years. The inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> were unable to completely delete <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s reign from the records, but as far as was in their power they erased all mention of it. This was due to the fact that <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with the help of some <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> had gone against them. So they did not count the years of his reign, but instead attributed the entire 36 year period to the elder brother. Similarly, they do not attribute the next 6 months after the death of the elder brother, which make up the complete 36 years, to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, the daughter of the elder brother and wife of the younger brother, who took over control of the kingdom after the death of her father. <br />Nor do they formally attribute to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the 19 days in which he jointly reigned with her. </p>                        </div>

Since there was a dearth of military men in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> at the time, he was summoned [home]. He arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, married the aforementioned <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, took the kingdom from her against her will, and then murdered her 19 days later. But he himself was killed for this loathsome deed by a group of soldiers during a military review. <br />This <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was succeeded by <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> called the New <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. He was the son of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a> and the brother of the aforementioned <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>. He reigned for 29 years. <br />His daughter <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> was the last of the Ptolemid dynasty. She reigned for 22 years. <br />These reigns also were not continuous from beginning to end, as is found in writings, but each had some interruptions in its course. In the reign of the New <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, his daughters <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> <a href=/people/4737 target=_blank>Tryphaena</a> and <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a>, had a three year reign ascribed to them: one year as a joint reign and the following two years, after the death of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> <a href=/people/4737 target=_blank>Tryphaena</a>, as the reign of <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a> on her own. Because <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> had gone to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and was spending a long time there, his daughters took over the rule of the kingdom, as if he was not going to return, and <a href=/people/743 target=_blank>Berenice</a> had some of her male relatives as co-rulers. But when <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he forget all affection towards his daughter, and, full of rage for what she had done, put her to death. <br />In the first years of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s reign, she shared power with her elder brother <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and then with others, for the following reasons. When the new <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> died, he left four children, two sons called <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and daughters called <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> and <a href=/people/509 target=_blank>Arsinoe</a>. He handed over power to the two eldest children, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, who reigned jointly for 4 years. This arrangement would have continued if <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> had not wanted to seize sole power for himself, defying his father's orders. However he died shortly, after being defeated in a naval battle by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a>, who came to the aid of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>. <br />After <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>'s death, <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s younger brother, who was also called <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, became joint ruler with his sister, according to <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wishes. The next year was called the fifth year of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> and the first year of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, and so it continued for the following two years, until he died. He died in his 4th year, which was <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s 8th year, due to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s treachery. Thereafter <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> ruled on her own, untill her 15th year. However, her 16th year was also called the first year, because after the death of <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> the king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360370UCha class=place long=37.0432 lat=35.9878>Chalcis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, the Roman general Marcus <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> gave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360370UCha class=place long=37.0432 lat=35.9878>Chalcis</a> and the surrounding regions to <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>. <br />And thenceforth for the remaining years until the 22nd year, which was the last of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>'s reign, the years were counted in the same way, so that the 22nd year was also called the 7th year. <br /><a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius Caesar</a>, also called <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a>, conquered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389207LAkt class=place long=20.68 lat=38.942>Actium</a>, and succeeded <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> as ruler of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> in the second year of the 184th Olympiad [43 B.C.].

Thus the total duration of the rule of all the kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, to the death of <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, is 293 years. </p>                        </div>

Before that time, however, the dates are provided according to the views of each writer. <br />About the Institution of the Olympics, which are Athletic Competitions. <br />It is necessary to discuss briefly [the origins of] the Olympics. There are some who place its beginning in remote antiquity, before the time of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. [This group attributes the founding of the Olympics] to one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=person long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Idaean</a> <a href=/people/12100 target=_blank>Dactyls</a>. Subsequently <a href=/people/3125 target=_blank>Aethlius</a> [used the concept] as a means of challenging his sons. And it was from his name that the adversaries are called athletes. After [<a href=/people/3125 target=_blank>Aethlius</a>] his sons <a href=/people/1809 target=_blank>Epeius</a> and then <a href=/people/954 target=_blank>Endymion</a>, <a href=/people/2587 target=_blank>Alexinus</a> and <a href=/people/901 target=_blank>Oenomaus</a> were each in charge of the sacrifices [connected with the] festival. Next <a href=/people/170 target=_blank>Pelops</a> [conducted an athletic competition] in honor of his father, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> (Aramazd). And then <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, son of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmene</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> (Aramazd) [held an athlethic competition]. <br />Now it was 10 generations — though some say only 3 — from the time of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> to the time of <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a>. <br />[<a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a>] was from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=place long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> and was the steward for the entire <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>. He wanted to reduce the fighting among the cities. To this end he had sent men throughout the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> to observe [conditions and] to learn how to lessen the military irritants. Then the gods gave the following commands to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a>: <br />Enter the temples and make sacrifice, And obey what the soothsayers command. <br />This additional prophesy was given to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=ethnic long=21.374 lat=37.89>Eleians</a>: <br /><a about=https://topostext.org/place/378215REle class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=37.8>Eleians</a>, hold firm to the laws of your forefathers And preserve your land, And put an end to warfare. <br />Stay in complete friendship with the [other] Greeks Until the arrival of a joyous celebration. <br />As a consequence of this, <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a> ordered that they stop fighting, and that each [party] begin to experience peace under confederation. He implemented <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>' command that they not attack one another. And he initiated the [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a>] games with <a href=/people/78 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=person long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonian</a>, who like himself was a descendant of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. At this time the stadion race was the sole competition; however, subsequently, one by one, other contests were added [to the games]. <br /><a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> relates that in the 27th Olympiad after <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a> the names of the winners in the athletic contests began to be recorded. Before then the athletes' names were not recorded. In the twenty[-eighth] <br />Olympiad, <a href=/people/1396 target=_blank>Coroebus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=person long=21.374 lat=37.89>Elis</a> won the stadion race, and he was the first [winner] to be recorded. Thus were the Olympiads initiated, by which the Greeks reckon their chronology. <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> supports <a href=/people/226 target=_blank>Aristodemus</a>' information; but <a href=/people/219 target=_blank>Callimachus</a> says that thirteen Olympiads passed after <a href=/people/751 target=_blank>Iphitus</a> without victors being recorded, and that <a href=/people/1396 target=_blank>Coroebus</a> was the victor in the 14th Olympiad. Many writers state that 459 years elapsed between the institution of the games by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> the son of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmene</a> and what is [commonly] regarded as the first Olympiad. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378214PEli class=ethnic long=21.374 lat=37.89>Eleians</a> hold the games every fifth year, with a four year interval separating them. </p>                        </div>

We shall not describe <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>' reign, but we shall describe what took place during <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>' reign. <br />Now <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, the first [post-<a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=demonym long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandrian</a>] king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, went to Old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz class=place long=34.432 lat=31.523>Gaza</a> and defeated <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> the son of <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> in battle.

He reigned for 32 years, from the first year of the 117th Olympiad [312 B.C.] until the fourth year of the 124th Olympiad [281 B.C.], and lived for a total of 75 years. Eventually, he was deceived and killed by his friend <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, called <a href=/people/1938 target=_blank>Ceraunus</a>. <br />[<a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>] was succeeded by his son <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, from <a href=/people/5440 target=_blank>Apame</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=person long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> was called <a href=/people/1517 target=_blank>Soter</a> which means Savior, and died in the [third] year of the 129th Olympiad [262 B.C.] after he had lived for a total of 54 years and had reigned for 19 years, from the first year of the 125th Olympiad [280 B.C.] until the third year of the 129th Olympiad [262 B.C.]. </p>                        </div>

However during his lifetime it happened that his younger brother <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> refused to accept the state of affairs and tried to take power. <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> had help and assistance from [<a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>], the brother of his mother <a href=/people/948 target=_blank>Laodice</a>, who controlled the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar class=place long=28.0403 lat=38.4883>Sardis</a>.

His younger brother <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> took charge in the second year of the 164th Olympiad [123 B.C.], and in the third year he defeated Zabinas, who committed suicide with poison because he could not endure the defeat. <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> reigned for 11 years, until the fourth year of the 166th Olympiad [113 B.C.]; the one year of his brother <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>' reign is also included in this total. He was called <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>, which means hook- nosed, and <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>. However, he ceded power to the aforementioned <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a> — who was his half-brother by the same mother as well as his nephew on his father's side — who attacked him. Thus <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a> gave up his kingdom and took refuge in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a>. Thus he was called Aspendius, as well as <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a> and <a href=/people/1596 target=_blank>Philometor</a>. <br /><a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a> began to rule in the first year of the 167th Olympiad [112 B.C.], after <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> [<a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>] fled to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a>. But in the second year of the same Olympiad [111 B.C.], <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369312PAsp class=place long=31.172 lat=36.939>Aspendus</a>, and seized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, while <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a> ruled in another part [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/335360RCSy class=place long=36 lat=33.5>Coele Syria</a>]. After the kingdom had been split between them in this way, <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a> remained as king until the fourth year of the 170th Olympiad [97 <br />B.C.]. He lived for an additional 15 years after his return, so that his reign lasted for a total of 26 years: 11 years on his own, and 15 years after the kingdom had been divided <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a> ruled from the first year of the 167th Olympiad [112 B.C.], and died in the first year of the 171st Olympiad [96 B.C.], after reigning for 18 years and living for a total of 50 years. Here is how he died. After <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Antiochus Grypus</a> died at the time which was stated above, his son <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> circulated around with an army and seized many cities. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a> brought an army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, but was defeated in battle. Now his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> carried him into the midst of the enemy. When they were about to capture him, he drew his sword and committed suicide. Thus <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> gained control of the entire kingdom, and captured <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>. </p>                        </div>

Their rulers first took the title [of king] in the seventh Olympiad [752-749 B.C.], when <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> founded the city of the Romans, and gave his name to the city, and to all the people who were ruled by its kings. Before this time they had been called sometimes <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, and sometimes Aborigines, having different names at different times. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> the son of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, and his successors ruled over [these folk] after the fall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> and prior to the foundation of the city. The history of these kings has been related by many different writers, not only native Romans but also Greeks. It will be sufficient to quote just two of them, as reliable witnesses to the events which we are considering. First I will quote <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> [of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=place long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>, d. ca. 7 B.C.], who provides a summary of the history of the Romans. In addition to books, he wrote an Ancient History of the Romans. In the first book, he gives an account of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and the kings after him following the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. I shall now summarize the relevant portions from Book One [1.9] which concern the matter at hand. <br />The History of the Romans from Book One of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>. <br />From this city, which the Romans now inhabit, the whole earth and sea is ruled. Its earliest inhabitants, it is said, were a native people, the barbarian <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicels</a>. No one knows for sure what the condition of the place was before [the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicels</a>], whether it was occupied by others or uninhabited. <br />But some time later the Aborigines gained possession of it, after a long war with its inhabitants. <br />These people had previously lived on the mountains in unwalled villages scattered around here and there. <br />They say that after them, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a> and some of the Greeks took the country. At first they were called Aborigines; but under <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, their king, who reigned at the time of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war, they began to be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>. Sixteen generations later, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> founded the city, and expanded it, and brought great prosperity to it. <br />Subsequently returning to the topic, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> [1.10] adds: <br />Some claim that the Aborigines, from whom the Romans are originally descended, were natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, a people which came into being spontaneously (Italy I designate as the entire peninsula which is bounded by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408187WIon class=place long=18.7 lat=39.2>Ionian Gulf</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a> Sea and by the region where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> live).

Later they were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=ethnic long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italians</a> after king <a href=/people/1918 target=_blank>Italus</a>, who also gave the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to the whole country. <a href=/people/1918 target=_blank>Italus</a> was succeeded by <a href=/people/4216 target=_blank>Morges</a>, from whose name they were called <a href=/people/4217 target=_blank>Morgetes</a>. And at the same time as <a href=/people/4007 target=_blank>Oenotrus</a>, his brother <a href=/people/4010 target=_blank>Peucetius</a> came as a colonist from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, and settled by the Junian bay, and the people were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409167RPeu class=ethnic long=16.7 lat=40.9>Peucetii</a> after him. <br />All this is [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>'] speculation. Then he writes: <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a> left Greece and came and settled in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=demonym long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> areas among the Aborigines. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a> were also called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrheni</a> [Etruscans] and the entire land was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenia</a>, after one of their rulers, who was called Tyrrhenus. Later, <a href=/people/1170 target=_blank>Euander</a> arrived with a fleet from Greece, from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223PPal class=place long=22.3289 lat=37.4526>Pallantium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, and he settled in the region of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> where the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> would later be built. [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>] says that they brought the Greek alphabet to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, along with the lyre, a musical instrument, and that they introduced [their] laws. <br />Subsequently <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> arrived with another Greek fleet and settled in the same area. At first, he was called Saturnius, and from his name the whole region was called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427115UAur class=place long=11.5048 lat=42.6662>Saturnia</a>. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> had a son named <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, and he too ruled over the land of the Aborigines. [These people] were called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> after him. When <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> died without any sons, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> the son of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a> succeeded him as king. <br />Later [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>] summarizes all of this as follows [DionHal 1.60]: <br />The Romans derived from the people who congregated there and mingled with the native population of the land. They were: first, the Aborigines, who expelled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicels</a> from the area. <br />[The Aborigines] were Greeks, originally from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnese</a>, who came as colonists with <a href=/people/4007 target=_blank>Oenotrus</a>, from the region which is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, I believe. The second [group of colonists], the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalians</a>, migrated there from the country which used to be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Haemonia</a>, and is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>. The third [group], the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgians</a>, arrived with <a href=/people/1170 target=_blank>Euander</a> from the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223PPal class=place long=22.3289 lat=37.4526>Pallantium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>. Then another group arrived, who were part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> army commanded by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>. Finally the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> who escaped with <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401264UDar class=place long=26.3725 lat=40.086>Dardanus</a> and the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> cities [came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>]. </p>                        </div>

There still remained five days after the solstice before the end of that year. I believe that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> spent the thirty-seven days that followed the taking of the city regulating the affairs of the city, receiving embassies from those who had withdrawn themselves, and creating a treaty with them. The next year, the first after capturing the city, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> set sail after the autumnal equinox, crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel class=place long=26.4 lat=40.2>Hellespont</a>, and landed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. They spent the winter there with others who had fled with them, and prepared for their next voyage. When spring arrived, they took ship and sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. They reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> at the end of that year, and passed the winter there living mixed in with the <a href=/people/12122 target=_blank>Elymians</a> in their cities. <br />Now as soon as it was possible to sail, they left the island [of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>], crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a> Sea, and arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417123ULau class=place long=12.3467 lat=41.711>Laurentum</a> on the coast of the Aborigines in the middle of the summer. <br />After capturing the region, they founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>. Thus ended the second year from the taking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. I have explained these matters as they seem to me. <br />Next, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> ornamented many sites with temples and other structures which exist to my own day. The following year, the third since the departure from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, he ruled as king over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> only. However, in the fourth year, after <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> died, [<a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>] took over his kingdom as well. <br />This was due to family ties through marriage and the inheritance through <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a>, after <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>' death. <br />A bit later [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>] adds that in a fierce battle over these [?] matters, <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, and many others had died. Nonetheless <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> those with him triumphed. <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> took power due to his marriage ties. But after ruling as king for three years after the death of <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> he lost his life in battle, in the fourth year. <br />Shortly after this [<a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>] writes: <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> died some the seven years after the taking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. <br /><a href=/people/3833 target=_blank>Euryleon</a>, who had been renamed <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> during the escape [from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>], took over rule of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> state.

After him, <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> reigned fifty-one, then Alba, thirty-nine; after Alba, <a href=/people/4108 target=_blank>Capetus</a> reigned twenty-six, then <a href=/people/1378 target=_blank>Capys</a> twenty-eight, and after <a href=/people/1378 target=_blank>Capys</a>, <a href=/people/4108 target=_blank>Capetus</a> held the rule for thirteen years. Then <a href=/people/1971 target=_blank>Tiberinus</a> reigned for a period of eight years. This king, it is said, perished in a battle that was fought by a river. <br />After being thrown by his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> into the stream, the river, which had previously been called the <a href=/people/2584 target=_blank>Albula</a>, came to be called after his name. <a href=/people/1971 target=_blank>Tiberinus</a>' successor, <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a>, reigned forty-one years. <br />After <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> the tyrant <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>, who was loathed by the gods, reigned nineteen years. <br />Disrespecting divine powers, he had created imitations of lightning and sounds resembling thunder, with which he hoped to terrify people into thinking that he was a god. But rain and lightning descended upon his house. The house was next to a lake which swelled to an unaccuctomed level, so that [<a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>] drowned with his entire household. To the present, in fact, when that lake is clear in a certain part, which happens whenever the level drops and the depths are undisturbed, the ruins of porticoes and other traces of a house can be seen. <br />[<a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>] was succeeded by Aventius, after whom was named one of the seven hills that are joined to make the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and he reigned thirty-seven years.

In my opinion none of them [the previous accounts] is accurate. Thus, because [the details] are not universally agreed on, we shall present a brief review. <a href=/people/3153 target=_blank>Cephalon</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399266UGer class=person long=26.6055 lat=39.9075>Gergis</a>, a very ancient writer, says that the city was built in the second generation after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war by those who had escaped from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> with <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. [<a href=/people/3153 target=_blank>Cephalon</a>] names Romus as its founder. [Romus] had been leader of the colony and one of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>' sons. He says that <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> had four sons, <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, <a href=/people/3833 target=_blank>Euryleon</a>, <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>. <br /><a href=/people/4969 target=_blank>Demagoras</a>, Agathymus and many other [authors] agree with [<a href=/people/3153 target=_blank>Cephalon</a>] regarding both the time and the leader of the colony. But the author of the history of the priestesses at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a> and of what happened in the days of each of them says that <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398206RMol class=ethnic long=20.6 lat=39.8>Molossians</a> with <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and became the founder of the city, which he named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — after one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> women. He says that this woman stirred up the other citizens (or women) and together with them set fire to the ships, since they had grown weary of wandering. <a href=/people/2612 target=_blank>Damastes</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262USig class=person long=26.1802 lat=39.9901>Sigeum</a> and some others agree with this [account]. <br />But <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, the philosopher, relates that some of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> were overtaken by a violent storm while they were navigating <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364232LMal class=place long=23.198 lat=36.436>Cape Malea</a> on their return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Since they were driven out of their course by the winds, they wandered over many parts of the sea finally arriving at this place in the land of the Opicans which is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=place long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latium</a>, by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=demonym long=10.5 lat=43>Tyrrhenian</a> sea. Being pleased with the sight of land, they hauled up their ships, and passed the winter there. They were preparing to sail at the beginning of spring, but their ships were set ablaze one night. Thus they could not depart and were, unwillingly, forced to live in the land where they had landed. He says this was effected by the captive women they were carrying with them from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. They burned the ships because they feared that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> in returning home would make slaves out of them. <a href=/people/218 target=_blank>Callias</a>, who wrote about the deeds of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, says that one of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> women who came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> with the other <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, [who was named] <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, married <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, the king of the Aborigines. She bore him two sons, Romus and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, who built a city, and named it after their mother. <br /><a href=/people/3487 target=_blank>Xenagoras</a>, the historian, wrote that <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Odysseus</a> and <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a> had three sons, Romus, Antias and Ardeias, who built three cities and named them after themselves. <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=person long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcis</a> names Romus as the founder of the city, but says that according to some this man was the son of <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, and according to others the son of <a href=/people/2284 target=_blank>Emathion</a>. <br />Now there are also other [writers] who claim that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was built by Romus, the son of <a href=/people/1918 target=_blank>Italus</a> and <a href=/people/1670 target=_blank>Leuce</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, while many other Greek historians describe different founders for the city. But so that I will not be considered wordy, let me come to the Roman historians. <br />The Romans lack even one historian or chronicler who can be considered ancient. But each of their historians has taken something out of ancient accounts that are preserved on tablets in their temples. Some of these say that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>, the founders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, were the sons of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. According to others they were the sons of a daughter of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, without mentioning who their father was. Some say that they were presented as hostages by <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> to <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>, the king of the Aborigines, when the treaty was made between the inhabitants and the immigrants. [According to this version], <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> gave them a friendly welcome and not only looked after them carefully, but, upon dying without a male heir, willed part of his kingdom to them. </p>                        </div>

And if anyone wants to look more carefully into the distant past, even a third foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> will be found. This [foundation] occurred before <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneias</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. <br />This is related by <a href=/people/4849 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=person long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>, whom I have mentioned before, hardly a commonplace historian. He says that when <a href=/people/4216 target=_blank>Morges</a> reigned in the land of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> — which then included all of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> to the coast of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404150PPos class=place long=15.0056 lat=40.4229>Poseidonia</a> — a man came to him who had fled from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />His words are: When <a href=/people/1918 target=_blank>Italus</a> was growing old, <a href=/people/4216 target=_blank>Morges</a> reigned. In his reign there came a man from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> named <a href=/people/4686 target=_blank>Sicelus</a>. Thus according to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=demonym long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracusan</a> author, an ancient <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> existed even before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war. However he left it unsaid whether [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>] was situated in the same region that the present city stands or whether some other place happened to be called by this name. Consequently I, too, cannot say for sure. <br />I believe that enough has been said about the ancient foundations [of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>]. As regards the last settlement or founding of the city, or whatever it should be styled, <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=person long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, based on some unknown calculation, places it at the same time as the founding of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, that is, in the thirty-eighth year before the first Olympiad [814 B.C.]. Lucius <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a>, a member of the senate, places it about the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad [729 B.C.]. <br />Quintus <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> places it in the first year of the eighth Olympiad [748 B.C.]. <a href=/people/756 target=_blank>Porcius</a> <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> does not give the date according to Greek reckoning, but being as careful as any [historian] in gathering material about ancient history, he places [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>'s] foundation four hundred and thirty-two years after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> war; and this date, when compared with the Chronicles of <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>, corresponds to the first year of the seventh Olympiad [752 B.C.]. In another work I have demonstrated the reliability of the canons of <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a>. In that same work I have also shown how to synchronize Roman and Greek chronology. <br /><a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, in the first book of his Ancient History of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=person long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, describes all the events which transpired following the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> in this order: the escape of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneias</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, and his arrival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; his descendants and successors, who were kings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, until the time of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and the foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; the various accounts of the ancient [historians] about the foundation of the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />However, some say that <a href=/people/12137 target=_blank>Picus</a> the son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronus</a> was the first king in the territory of Laurentium, where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is now situated, and that he reigned for 37 years. After him <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> the son of <a href=/people/12137 target=_blank>Picus</a> [ruled] for 44 years. In his reign, <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> traveled from Spain and erected an altar in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SFBo class=place long=12.4812 lat=41.8889>Forum Boarium</a>, to commemorate his killing of <a href=/people/12088 target=_blank>Cacus</a>, <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcanus</a>' son. Then <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> was king for 36 years. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> were named after him. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> was captured in the 33rd year of his reign. Then <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> fought against the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutuli</a>, and killed <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>. He married <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a>, <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a>' daughter, and founded the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>. After this he was king for 3 years. This summarizes what we have found in the books of other writers. </p>                        </div>

[<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] recorded the history of the Romans in his seventh book, as follows. <br />On the Ancient History of the Romans, from the Seventh Book of <a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>. <br />Some historians have incorrectly suggested that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> [and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>], who founded the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, were the sons of the daughter of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. But this is not the case, for a lengthy period intervened between <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> [filled with] many kings. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was founded in the second year of the 7th Olympiad [751 B.C.], which was 433 years after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> War. <br /><a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> became king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> three years after the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. He ruled for three years and then vanished from sight, to be honoured [thereafter] as an immortal. He was succeeded as king by his son <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>, who founded the city today called [<a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>] Longa. It was named after the river which was then called Alba, but is now called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. <br />Now the historian <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, who wrote about things Roman, tells a different tale about the name of this city. He says that it was foretold to <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, that a four-footed animal would lead him to the place where he would must build a city. When he was preparing to sacrifice a pregnant white <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>, the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> escaped from his grasp and was chased up a hill, where she gave birth to thirty <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>piglets</a>. <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> was astounded by this, and being desirous of fulfilling the prophecy, he commenced building on that site. But he was warned in a dream, that he should not found the city until thirty years had passed, the same number as the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>piglets</a> which were born to the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>. <br />And so he abandoned his plan. <br />After the death of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, his son <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> became king and after thirty years he founded a settlement on the hill, which he called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>, after the colour of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>; for the Latin word for 'white' is alba. [<a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>] also added another name, Longa, which translates 'long', because the city was narrow in width and of great length. <br />[<a href=/people/199 target=_blank>Diodorus</a>] adds that <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> the capital of his kingdom and conquered no small number of the inhabitants round about. [<a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>] became a noteworthy man and died after a ruling for thirty-eight years. <br />After his death, there arose a division among the masses, since two men who were contending with each other for the kingship. <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> claimed that since he was <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a>' son, his father's kingdom belonged to him. But <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> and, furthermore, a son of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> by his first wife, who was a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> woman, maintained that the kingdom belonged to him. <br />Now it happened that after the death of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, <a href=/people/387 target=_blank>Ascanius</a> had plotted against the life of <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>. <br />It was while the child [<a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>] was being reared by some herdsmen on a mountain, to avoid this plot, that he came to be called <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, after the name of that mountain, which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a> call Silva. After a struggle between the two sides, <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> finally took the throne with the support of the people. <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a>, though he did not take power, was established as supreme priest (pontifex maximus) thereby becoming like a second king. They say that the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> family, which survives in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> even to this day, descends from him. </p>                        </div>

He ruled for 38 years. The next king was Epitus <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, for 26 years. When his death Capis succeeded as king, ruling for 28 years. His son Calpetus was the next king, ruling for 13 years. Then <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> ruling for 8 years. [<a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>] went off to fight against the Etruscans with an army, but while he was crossing the river Alba he fell into a whirlpool and died. As a result, the name of the river was changed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>. After his death <a href=/people/7188 target=_blank>Agrippa</a> became king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, for 41 years. <br />The next king was Arramulius <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, who reigned for 19 years. It is related that Arramulius was arrogant throughout his life, and became so proud that he claimed to rival the power of Aramazd (<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>/<a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>). When there was steady and severe thunder during the heat [of autumn], he ordered all the men in his army at a given command to strike their swords against their shields, supposing that by this noise he could surpass even thunder. Consequently the gods exacted vengeance and killed him with a bolt of lightning and submerged his house in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127WAlb class=place long=12.67 lat=41.75>Alban lake</a>. The Romans who live near the lake today still point out some columns which can be seen deep beneath the surface of the water, which are the remains of the royal palace under the lake. <br />Aventius, who was chosen to be the next king, ruled for 37 years. During a battle against the people who lived around the city, he was trapped in a narrow space and killed near a hill, which was named the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> hill after him. After he died, his son <a href=/people/3674 target=_blank>Procas</a> <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a> was appointed to be the next king, and he ruled for 23 years. After his death, his younger son <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> forcibly seized power, because his elder brother <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a> was in a foreign country. <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> reigned for a little over 43 years, and was killed by <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, who founded the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

This is known both from the order of the kings' succession and the number of years each of them ruled. Following <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>' death the city was kingless for one year. <br />Then <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> <a href=/people/1714 target=_blank>Pompilius</a>, who was chosen by the army, reigned for forty-three years. <br />After <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> <a href=/people/779 target=_blank>Hostilius</a> ruled for thirty-three years. <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus Marcius</a>, his successor, ruled for twenty-four years. He was followed by Lucius <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a>, called <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>, for thirty-eight years. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> succeeded him, reigning for forty-four years. The murderer of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, the tyrant Lucius <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a>, extended his reign to the twenty-fifth year. Because of his contempt of justice, he was called <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a>. <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, the first ruler of the city, must have begun to rule in the first year of the seventh Olympiad [752 B.C.], when <a href=/people/1236 target=_blank>Charops</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> was in the first year of his ten-year term as archon. [We calculate this] because the reigns of the kings amount to two hundred and forty-four years or sixty-one Olympiads. Thus the count of the [monarchs'] years requires this [determination of the placing of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>' rule]; and the number of years that each king reigned is known from writings. Such is the account given by those who lived before me and adopted by me concerning the time of the settlement of the city which now rules supreme. <br />This is <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>' account. <br />Now after the death of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> and the collapse of unified [royal] rule, the Romans no longer had kings. <br />Instead, they appointed consuls [starting with] <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>; then [they appointed] tribunes of the plebs; then dictators, who were orators; and then consuls again. I think it would be superfluous to list the magistrates of each year here, because there would be a huge mass of names. Moreover, if I described their achievements in detail, my account would become greatly enlarged and stray from its intended purpose. Consequently I think it is appropriate to leave these magistrates, and everything connected with them, to another chronicle: that is, the consuls who followed <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a>, the tribunes of the plebs and the dictators who governed the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> during the years preceding the advent of <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. After these remarks, we will return to the reign of the first emperor. From the death of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> until the time of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a>, 115 Olympiads — the equivalent of 460 years — elapsed. <br /><a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> died at the end of the 67th Olympiad [509 B.C.]. <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> became emperor at the start of the 183rd Olympiad [48 B.C.]. Between these [two termini] an interval of 460 years exists. From the 7th Olympiad [752 B.C.], when the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was founded, [until the death of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a>] 244 years elapsed. <br />Thus, a total of 704 years — which is the equivalent of 176 Olympiads — elapsed from the foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> until the time of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a>. <br />This [schema] is confirmed by the chronicler <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> who writes as follows in a passage summarizing the [relevant] dates: <br /><a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> on the Kingdom of the Romans. <br />We have listed the kings of the Romans one by one, beginning with <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> son of <a href=/people/316 target=_blank>Anchises</a>, when he became king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, and concluding with <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> <a href=/people/845 target=_blank>Silvius</a>, who was killed by <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, the son of his niece <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a>. Now we will add <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and the others who ruled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after him up until <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/2188 target=_blank>Superbus</a>, for a period of 244 years. After these kings, we will give a separate list of the consuls, starting from Lucius <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Junius</a> <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, and ending with Marcus <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, who were consuls when <a href=/people/890 target=_blank>Theophemus</a> was archon at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> [61 B.C.]. <br />Altogether [they ruled] for 460 years. <br />That is what <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> says. Now it is appropriate for us to append a list of the emperors of the Romans, starting from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a>. We shall mention the consuls for each year, equating [these dates] with the Olympiads. </p>                        </div>
