Thus <a href=/people/577 target=_blank>Ammon</a> was named of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> by <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> and he made a magnificent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>sanctuary</a> for him on the spot where he found the water. This is nine miles from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. Because of this, he asked <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> that the ram be placed among the stars. Other people think that it is the ram which carried <a href=/people/1689 target=_blank>Helle</a> and <a href=/people/5186 target=_blank>Phryxus</a>. <br />The Bull (<a href=/people/10933 target=_blank>Taurus</a>) is favoured by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>; <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> got it from his brother <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> as a favour. He appeared to human eyes in the form of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> and also, on the order of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> played with <a href=/people/434 target=_blank>Europa</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/394 target=_blank>Agenor</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidonia</a>, picked her up and carried her off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre class=place long=25.1836 lat=35.2052>Crete</a>. Because of this, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> honoured it with an immortal memorial in the stars. <br />The Twins (Gemini), which are called the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405255SMeg class=demonym long=25.5301 lat=40.5008>Samothracian</a> gods and whose story it is profane to utter except for those who preside at the ritual. Other people say that they are <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> and <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a>, because these princes had kept the sea safe from <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>. There are people who say they are <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> and <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, who carried out similar labours. <br />The Crab, καρκίνος, got the favour of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, because, at her order, when <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> had been sent to kill the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375227ULer class=demonym long=22.7182 lat=37.5511>Lernaean</a> <a href=/people/1205 target=_blank>Hydra</a> (which we call a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>), the crab attacked <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>' feet and tore at his ankles, causing him more discomfort than the <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> itself. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> found this pain exceptionally troublesome and, because of this deed, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> honoured the crab with stars <br />The Lion, λέων, which was brought up at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378227SNem class=place long=22.7108 lat=37.8085>Nemea</a> by the will of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> in order to kill <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, was sent to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> territory and hid for a long time in a cave. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> is said to have killed it with his friend <a href=/people/7989 target=_blank>Molorchus</a>, from whom he first received his club, with which he killed the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and after this he wore its pelt as a hood. Because of this deed, he began to be hated by <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> and she honoured the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> with the heavenly prize. <br />The <a href=/people/138 target=_blank>Maid</a> (Virgo), whom we call <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>, was among people, but when people began to behave badly, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> placed her among the constellations. There are those who say that she is <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, the daughter of <a href=/people/1874 target=_blank>Icarius</a>; <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> gave him wine, so that he might give people pleasure: the ones he gave it to became drunk and stoned him to death. A <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> was with him and saw its master's death; it returned to <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a> howling. Seeing it sad and strange, she was worried and set out with it. They came to the place where <a href=/people/1874 target=_blank>Icarius</a> was lying. She saw the body of her father; with great lamentation, she buried him on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238LHym class=place long=23.815 lat=37.946>Hymettus</a>. In the same place she hanged herself with a noose. The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> lay at her feet for a long time and went without food, until, desperate for water, it threw itself into a well. Then <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> asked <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, because they had died as a result of his command, for the maid to be placed among the course of the stars. <a href=/people/1874 target=_blank>Icarius</a> was called <a href=/people/632 target=_blank>Arcturus</a> (when this star rises, it causes continual storms), and the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> is the Dog Star. </p>                        </div>

Thus he was counted among the number of the stars and was called the Scales. <br />The Scorpion, which is said to have been born on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386260LPel class=place long=26.0064 lat=38.5572>Pelinaeus</a> on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a> to destroy <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> at the desire of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>. But while <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> was hunting, he saw <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> and wanted to rape her. She threw down the scorpion which took his life. <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> put both the scorpion and <a href=/people/297 target=_blank>Orion</a> among the stars. <br />The Archer, Croton, was the son of the nurse of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>; the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> always loved him, because he entertained them with applause and archery tricks. Others say that he is <a href=/people/1086 target=_blank>Chiron</a>, because he was just and pious, learned and hospitable. <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Aesculapius</a> learned medicine from him, <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> the lyre and many other things. <br />The Goat-Horned (<a href=/people/10728 target=_blank>Capricorn</a>), whose name is <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>. At the time when <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a> lived in caves in Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> and came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> for war, <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> transformed himself into a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>. Therefore, after the immortal gods had properly punished <a href=/people/233 target=_blank>Typhon</a>, they decorated the sky with a <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a> of stars as a memorial. <br />The Water-carrier, who is thought to be <a href=/people/1283 target=_blank>Ganymedes</a>; is said to be <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=demonym long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessalian</a>, who alone except for his wife <a href=/people/1196 target=_blank>Pyrrha</a> escaped the greatest cataclysm.

For it is said also that, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> River, the egg of a fish * * * sat by a dove on the edge of the river and that the goddess, kind and sympathetic to people, hatched it for the good life.

For when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ought to have dismissed his army and come into the city, according to the customs and law of the ancestors, and instructed the senate on the things he had done and thus to have received a consulship, he pretended that he was afraid because of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and refused to dismiss his army unless his candidacy in the consular elections was recognised despite his absence [from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>]. Because of this, he was judged an enemy by the Senate and he decided to claim it through war. And thus he gained not just a consulship and a triumph, he brought control of the whole Roman people under his power. <br />The fourth war was Caesar <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> against multiple leaders: against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> the Younger, who sought to regain his father's property; shortly after against <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, in vengeance for killing his father; then against <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, who brought a final war upon the fatherland. </p>                        </div>
