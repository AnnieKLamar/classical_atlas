Mneson died without issue; <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> (I) died leaving a son, <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>; <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, the sole survivor of the three, acted with great injustice towards <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>. <a href=/people/4430 target=_blank>Archedamus</a>, therefore, the grandfather of the man who makes the speech, being married to <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>'s mother after her first husband's death, pitying <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> because he was an orphan, claimed a large sum of money from <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a> on account of the wrongs committed by the latter against <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>. Mindful of this kindness <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> introduced <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a>, the son of his half-sister and grandson of <a href=/people/4430 target=_blank>Archedamus</a>, to his fellow-wardsmen as his adopted son. <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> (II) had already been inscribed among the members of the families and of the ward, but had not yet been placed on the official register of the deme, when <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> died. After <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>'s death <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> (II) was inscribed on the register; nevertheless the daughter of <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, the uncle of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> contested the succession against <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> (II), alleging that it was not by any means in accordance with the wishes of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> that <a href=/people/506 target=_blank>Thrasyllus</a> had been inscribed among the wardsmen and kindred, and that the adoption was fictitious. Such is the subject of the trial; the discussion turns on a question of fact, and so, with great skill and ingenuity, the speaker explains the enmity of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> towards <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, which supplies a strong presumption that he did not wish that his property should be inherited by <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>'s daughter. <br />I should have thought, gentlemen, that there was one class of adoptions which could not be disputed, namely, those which are made by the adopter personally in his lifetime and in full possession of his faculties, after he has led his adopted son to the domestic shrines and presented him to his kindred and inscribed him in the official registers, and himself carried out all the proper formalities.</p>                        </div>

By the former method the adopter sets forth his wishes with perfect clearness, making the whole transaction valid in the manner permitted by the laws; whereas the man who commits his wishes to a sealed-up will makes them secret, with the result that claimants often think fit to contest the succession against adopted sons, alleging that the will is a forgery. It appears, however, that this distinction is of little practical value; for though my adoption was quite openly carried out, yet representatives of <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>'s daughter have come forward to contest my right to <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>'s estate.</p>                        </div>
