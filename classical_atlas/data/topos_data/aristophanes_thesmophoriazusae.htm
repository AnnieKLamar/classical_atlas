Why the fellow has kept me on the run ever since early this morning; he wants to kill me, that's certain. Before I lose my spleen entirely, <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a>, can you at least tell me whither you are leading me? <br />EURIPIDES: What need for you to hear what you are going to see? <br />MNESILOCHUS: How is that? Repeat it. No need for me to hear.... <br />EURIPIDES: What you are going to see. <br />MNESILOCHUS: Nor consequently to see.... <br />EURIPIDES: What you have to hear. <br />MNESILOCHUS: What is this wiseacre stuff you are telling me? I must neither see nor hear. <br />EURIPIDES: Ah! but you have two things there that are essentially distinct. <br />MNESILOCHUS: Seeing and hearing. <br />EURIPIDES: Undoubtedly. <br />MNESILOCHUS: In what way distinct? <br />EURIPIDES: In this way. Formerly, when Ether separated the elements and bore the animals that were moving in her bosom, she wished to endow them with sight, and so made the eye round like the sun's disc and bored ears in the form of a funnel. <br />MNESILOCHUS: And because of this funnel I neither see nor hear. Ah! great gods! I am delighted to know it. What a fine thing it is to talk with wise men! <br />EURIPIDES: I will teach you many another thing of the sort. <br />MNESILOCHUS: That's well to know; but first of all I should like to find out how to grow lame, so that I need not have to follow you all about. <br />EURIPIDES: Come, hear and give heed! <br />MNESILOCHUS: I'm here and waiting. <br />EURIPIDES: Do you see that little door? <br />MNESILOCHUS: Yes, certainly. </p>                        </div>

My dress is in harmony with my thoughts. A poet must adopt the nature of his characters. Thus, if he is placing women on the stage, he must contract all their habits in his own person. <br />MNESILOCHUS: Then you ride the high <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> when you are composing a <a href=/people/953 target=_blank>Phaedra</a>. <br />AGATHON: If the heroes are men, everything in him will be manly.

And have you not heard what a dandy <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> was and how careful in his dress? For this reason his pieces were also beautiful, for the works of a poet are copied from himself. <br />MNESILOCHUS: Ah! so it is for this reason that <a href=/people/723 target=_blank>Philocles</a>, who is so hideous, writes hideous pieces; <a href=/people/1540 target=_blank>Xenocles</a>, who is malicious, malicious ones, and <a href=/people/1029 target=_blank>Theognis</a>, who is cold, such cold ones? <br />AGATHON: Yes, necessarily and unavoidably; and 'tis because I knew this that I have so well cared for my person. </p>                        </div>

Formerly the old men married young girls, but they have been so calumniated that none think of them now, thanks to the verse. A woman is the tyrant of the old man who marries her. Again, it is because of <a href=/people/75 target=_blank>Euripides</a> that we are incessantly watched, that we are shut up behind bolts and bars, and that <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> are kept to frighten off the gallants.
