For the rhapsode ought to make himself an interpreter of the poet's thought to his audience; and to do this properly without knowing what the poet means is impossible. So one cannot but envy all this. <br />ION: What you say is true, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>: I at any rate have found this the most laborious part of my art; and I consider I speak about <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> better than anybody, for neither [530d] <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403267UPit class=person long=26.6992 lat=40.3467>Lampsacus</a>, nor <a href=/people/2261 target=_blank>Stesimbrotus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha class=person long=24.7138 lat=40.7799>Thasos</a>, nor <a href=/people/1348 target=_blank>Glaucon</a>, nor any one that the world has ever seen, had so many and such fine comments to offer on <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> as I have. <br />SOCRATES: That is good news, <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a>; for obviously you will not grudge me an exhibition of them. <br />ION: And indeed it is worth hearing, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, how well I have embellished <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>; so that I think I deserve to be crowned with a golden crown by the <a href=/people/2753 target=_blank>Homeridae</a>. <br />SOCRATES: Yes, and I must find myself leisure some time to listen to you; </p>                        </div>

For if you could do it with art, you could speak on all the other poets as well; since there is an art of poetry, I take it, as a whole, is there not? <br />ION: Yes.

Do you require some explanation from me, <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a>, of what I mean by this? <br />ION: Yes, upon my word, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, I do; for I enjoy listening to you wise men. <br />SOCRATES: I only wish you were right there, <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a>: but surely it is you rhapsodes and actors, and the men whose poems you chant, who are wise; whereas I speak but the plain truth, as a simple layman might. [532e] For in regard to this question I asked you just now, observe what a trifling commonplace it was that I uttered — a thing that any man might know — namely, that when one has acquired a whole art the inquiry is the same. Let us just think it out thus: there is an art of painting as a whole? <br />ION: Yes. <br />SOCRATES: And there are and have been many painters, good and bad? <br />ION: Certainly. <br />SOCRATES: Now have you ever found anybody who is skilled in pointing out the successes and failures among the works of <a href=/people/1079 target=_blank>Polygnotus</a> son of <a href=/people/3754 target=_blank>Aglaophon</a>, but unable to do so with the works of the other painters; </p>                        </div>

In the same manner also the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> inspires men herself, and then by means of these inspired persons the inspiration spreads to others, and holds them in a connected chain.

For the poets tell us, I believe, that the songs they bring us are the sweets they cull from honey-dropping founts [534b] in certain gardens and glades of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> — like the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>, and winging the air as these do.

For not by art do they utter these things, but by divine influence; since, if they had fully learnt by art to speak on one kind of theme, they would know how to speak on all. And for this reason God takes away the mind of these men and uses them as his ministers, just as he does soothsayers and godly seers, [534d] in order that we who hear them may know that it is not they who utter these words of great price, when they are out of their wits, but that it is God himself who speaks and addresses us through them. A convincing proof of what I say is the case of <a href=/people/4328 target=_blank>Tynnichus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385236PCha class=demonym long=23.6153 lat=38.4597>Chalcidian</a>, who had never composed a single poem in his life that could deserve any mention, and then produced the paean which is in everyone's mouth, almost the finest song we have, simply — as he says himself — an invention of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>.
