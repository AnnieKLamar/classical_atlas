But she did not make it as great and beautiful as it is, not from any economy or lack of possessions — what doth a queen lack? — but because her prophetic soul told her that she should leave a family well knowing how better to adorn it. Whence Juliana, the glory of her blessed parents, inheriting their royal blood in the fourth generation, did not defeat the hopes of the Queen, the mother of a noble race, but raised this from a small temple to its present size and beauty, increasing the glory of her many-sceptred ancestors; for all that she made, she made more magnificent than they, holding the true faith of a mind devoted to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. Who hath not heard of Juliana, how in her pious care she glorified even her parents by fair-fashioned works? All alone by her righteous toil she built a worthy house to immortal <a href=/people/825 target=_blank>Polyeuctus</a>, for she had ever studied to give blameless gifts to all athletes of the Heavenly King. Every country cries, every city, that she made her parents more glorious by better works. Where do we not find that Juliana hath raised splendid temples to the Saints? Where do we not see the signs of the pious hand of thee alone? What place hath not learnt that thy mind is full of piety? The inhabitants of the whole world sing thy works, which are eternally remembered. For the works of piety are not hidden; oblivion doth not quench the labours of beneficent virtue. Not even thyself knoweth how many houses dedicated to God thy hand hath made; for thou alone, I ween, didst build innumerable temples all over the world, ever fearing the servants of God in Heaven. Following by her good works all the footsteps of her parents she made the fame of her race immortal, always walking in the whole path of piety. Therefore, all ye servants of the Heavenly King to whom she gave gifts or built temples, preserve her gladly with her son and his daughters, and may the immeasurable glory of the most beneficent family survive as long as the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> drives his burning chariot. <br />At the Entrance of the same Church, outside the Narthex towards the Apse: What quire is sufficient to chant the works of Juliana, who after <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, the adorner of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and after the holy golden light of <a href=/people/715 target=_blank>Theodosius</a>, and after so many royal ancestors, in a few years accomplished a work worthy of her race, yea, more than worthy? She alone did violence to Time and surpassed the wisdom of renowned <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a> by raising a habitation for God, whose glittering and elaborate beauty the ages cannot celebrate — how it rises from its deep-rooted foundations, running up from the ground and aspiring to the stars of heaven, and how from east to west it extends itself glittering with unspeakable brightness in the sunlight on both its sides! On either side of its aisle columns standing on firm columns support the rays of the golden dome, while on each side arched recesses scattered on the dome reproduce the ever-revolving light of the moon. The opposite walls in innumerable paths are clothed in marvellous metallic veins of colour, like flowery meadows which Nature made to flower in the depth of the rock, and hid their glory, keeping them for the House of God, to be the gift of Juliana, so that she might produce a divine work, following in her toil the stainless dictates of her heart. What singer of skilful works shall now hasten to the west, armed with a hundred eyes, and read aright the various devices on the walls, gazing on the circle of the shining house, one story set on another? There you may see a marvellous creation of the holy pencils above the centre of the porch, the wise <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantine</a>, how escaping from the idols he quenched the impious fury of the heathen and found the light of the Trinity by cleansing his limbs in water. Such is the labour that Juliana, after a countless swarm of labours, accomplished for the souls of her parents, and for her own life, and for that of those who are and shall be. </p>                        </div>

He who made thee, <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, should have mixed sweet music with the bronze, and the dumb bronze had reverenced thee, and responded to the strains of thy lyre. <br />ANAXIMENES: <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a> the wise philosopher was there, and in deep absorption he was revolving the subtle thoughts of his divine intellect. <br />CALCHAS: And <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a>, son of <a href=/people/2201 target=_blank>Thestor</a>, stood there, the clearsighted prophet, as if prophesying, and he seemed to be concealing his message, either pitying the Greek host or still dreading the king of golden <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377228PMyk class=place long=22.7561 lat=37.7308>Mycenae</a>. <br />PYRRHUS: Look on the cub of the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aeacidae</a>, <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> the son of <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> the sacker of cities, how he longed to handle the bronze weapons that the artist did not give him; for he had wrought him naked: he seemed to be gazing up, as if directing his eyes to windswept <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilion</a>. <br /><a href=/people/1146 target=_blank>Amymone</a> and <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>: There sat rosy-fingered <a href=/people/1146 target=_blank>Amymone</a>. She was gathering up her unfilleted hair behind, while her face was unveiled, and with upturned glance she was gazing at her black-haired lord the Sea-King. For near her stood <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Poseidon</a>, naked, with flowing hair, holding out to her a dripping <a href=/people/10965 target=_blank>dolphin</a>, bringing a suitor's gifts for the hand of the much-sought maiden. <br />SAPPHO: And the clear-toned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402225RPie class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.2>Pierian</a> <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> sat there at rest, <a href=/people/483 target=_blank>Sappho</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=person long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>. She seemed to be weaving some lovely melody, with her mind devoted to the silent <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. <br />APOLLO: There stood <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> who speaketh from the tripod. He had bound up behind his loosely flowing hair. In the bronze he was naked, because <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> knoweth how to make naked to them who enquire of him the true decrees of <a href=/people/140 target=_blank>Fate</a>, or because he appeareth to all alike, for King <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> is the <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Sun</a> and his pure brilliancy is seen from far. <br /><a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>: And near shone <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a>, shedding drops of beauty on the bright bronze. Her bust was naked, but her dress was gathered about her rounded thighs and she had bound her hair with a golden kerchief. <br /><a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>: And I marvelled at the son of <a href=/people/810 target=_blank>Cleinias</a>, seeing him glistening with glory, for he had interwoven with the bronze the rays of his beauty. Such was he as when in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, the mother of story, he awoke wise counsel. <br /><a href=/people/1324 target=_blank>Chryses</a>: Near him stood the priest <a href=/people/1324 target=_blank>Chryses</a>, holding in his right hand the sceptre of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> and wearing on his head a fillet. Of surpassing stature was he, as being one of the holy race of heroes. Methinks he was imploring <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>. His thick beard bloomed in abundance, and down his back trailed the clusters of his unplaited hair. <br /><a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius Caesar</a>: Near him shone forth <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Julius</a>, who once adorned <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with innumerable shields of her foes. He wore on his shoulders a grisly-faced aegis, and carried exulting in his right hand a thunder-bolt, as one bearing in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> the title of a second <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>. <br /><a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>: There stood god-like <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, who erst in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> revealed the secret paths of heaven-taught virtue. <br /><a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>: And another high born <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> I saw all of gold, naked, all glittering; and on the breast of the goddess, hanging from her neck, fell in coils the flowing cestus. <br /><a href=/people/3127 target=_blank>Hermaphroditus</a>: There stood lovely <a href=/people/3127 target=_blank>Hermaphroditus</a>, nor wholly a man, nor wholly a woman, for the statue was of mixed form: readily couldst thou tell him to be the son of fair-bosomed <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> and of <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a>. His breasts were swelling like a girl's, but he plainly had the procreative organs of a man, and he showed features of the beauty of both sexes. </p>                        </div>

For but just after his birth a creature of the air, a nightingale from somewhere, settled secretly on his lips and struck up its clear song. <br />DEMOCRITUS: Hail, <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>, glory of the land of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a>; for thou didst explore the laws of Nature, the mother of beautiful children, discerning the subtle mysteries of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> of Science: and ever didst thou laugh at the slippery paths of life, well aware that ancient Time outstrippeth all. <br /><a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, <a href=/people/1259 target=_blank>Auge</a> and <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>: <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a>, no down yet visible on the circle of his chin, was holding in the hand that had slain the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> the golden apples, rich fruit of the Libyan land, and by him stood the priestess of <a href=/people/681 target=_blank>Pallas</a>, the maiden <a href=/people/1259 target=_blank>Auge</a>, her mantle thrown over her head and shoulders, for her hair was not done up with a kerchief. Her hands were uplifted as if she were calling on the grey-eyed daughter of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> under the hill of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375224PTeg class=place long=22.429 lat=37.464>Tegea</a>.

She had drawn her veil over both her cheeks, her form was draped in a long gown, as if she were lamenting, and her bronze tears signified that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, her nurse, was captive after its siege by the Greek warriors. <br />HELENUS: Nor did <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a> cease from wrath, but seemed pitiless to his country, still stirring his wrath. In his right hand he raised a cup for libations, and I deem he was foretelling good to the Greeks and praying to the gods to bring his nurse to the extremity of woe. <br />ANDROMACHE: And <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a>, the rosy-ankled daughter of <a href=/people/1342 target=_blank>Eetion</a>, stood there not weeping or lamenting, for not yet, I deem, had <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> with the glancing helm fallen in the war, nor had the exultant sons of the shieldbearing Greeks laid waste entirely her <a href=/people/3163 target=_blank>Dardan</a> nurse. <br /><a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> and <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a>: There one might see <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a> warlike, but rejoicing in the victory, for his heart was warmed with great joy, as he saw near him rosy-armed <a href=/people/69 target=_blank>Helen</a> reconciled. I marvelled at her lovely image, that gave the bronze a grace most desirable, for het beauty even in that soulless work breathed warm love. <br /><a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> and <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>: Goodly <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> was rejoicing in his wily mind, for he was not devoid of his versatile wits, but still wore the guise of subtlety. And he was laughing in his heart, for he gloried in having laid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> low by his cunning. But do thou tell me, mother of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>, unhappy <a href=/people/2138 target=_blank>Hecuba</a>, which of the immortals taught thee to shed tears in this thy dumb presentment? Not even the bronze made thee cease from wailing, nor did lifeless Art have pity on thee and stop thee from thy irremediable fury; but still thou standest by weeping, and, as I guess, no longer dost thou lament the death of unhappy <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> or the deep grief of poor <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a>, but the fall of thy city; for thy cloak drawn over thy face indicates thy sorrow, and thy gown ungirt and descending to thy feet announces the mourning thou hast within. Extreme anguish hath bound thy spirit, the tears ran down thy cheeks, but Art hath dried them, proclaiming how searching is the drought of thy incurable woe. <br />CASSANDRA: There saw I the prophetess <a href=/people/631 target=_blank>Cassandra</a>, who, blaming her father in silence, seemed filled with prescient fury as if prophesying the last woes of her city. <br /><a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> and <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a>: Here was another <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>, sacker of cities, not wearing on his locks a plumed helmet or shaking a spear, but naked he glittered, his face beardless, and raising his right hand in testimony of victory he looked askance on weeping <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a>. Tell me, <a href=/people/10611 target=_blank>Polyxena</a>, unhappy virgin, what forces thee to shed hidden tears now thou art of mute bronze, why dost thou draw thy veil over thy face, and stand like one ashamed, but sorry at heart? Is it for fear lest <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/393223RPht class=person long=22.5 lat=39.2>Phthia</a> won thee for his spoil after destroying thy city? Nor did the arrows of thy beauty save thee — thy beauty which once entrapped his father, leading him of his own will into the net of unexpected death. Yea, by thy brazen image I swear had Prince <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> seen thee as thou here art, he would have taken thee to wife and abandoned the memory of his father's fate. </p>                        </div>

He seemed in the flower of youth, for the surface of his chin was not yet marked with the bloom of hair. His whole well-knit body was naked, but weighty with valour he wielded the goad of war. <br /><a href=/people/2958 target=_blank>Oenone</a> and <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a>: <a href=/people/2958 target=_blank>Oenone</a> was boiling over with anger — boiling, eating out her heart with bitter jealousy. She was furtively watching <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> with her wild eyes and conveyed to him secret threats, spurning her ill-fated lord with her right hand. The cowherd seemed ashamed, and he was looking the other way, unfortunate lover, for he feared to look on <a href=/people/2958 target=_blank>Oenone</a> in tears, his bride of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397266UKeb class=person long=26.5564 lat=39.7381>Kebrene</a>. <br />DARES, ENTELLUS: <a href=/people/12136 target=_blank>Dares</a> was fastening on his hands his leather boxing-straps and arming himself with wrath, the herald of the fight; with mobile eyes he breathed the hot breath of valour. <a href=/people/12123 target=_blank>Entellus</a> opposite gazed at him in fury, handling too the cestus that pierceth the flesh, his spirit big with blood-thirsty menace. <br />A WRESTLER: And there was a strong man skilled in wrestling, <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> knows if his name were <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a> or <a href=/people/1462 target=_blank>Philammon</a>, or <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, the bulwark of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; for I could not learn it to tell you, the famous name of this man of might; but in any case he was full of valour. He had a shaggy trailing beard, and his face proclaimed him one to be feared in the arena. His locks were fretful, and the hard stretched muscles of his sturdy limbs projected, and when his fists were clenched his two thick arms were as firm as stone. On his robust back stood out a powerful muscle running up on each side of the hollow of his flexible neck. <br />CHARIDEMUS: Look, I beg, on <a href=/people/472 target=_blank>Charidemus</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=person long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> chief, who had their army under his command. <br />MELAMPUS: And thou wouldst marvel looking on <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a>; he bore the holy semblance of a prophet, and with his silent lips he seemed to be breathing intensely the divine breath of inspiration. <br />PANTHOUS, THYMOETES, LAMPON, AND CLYTIUS: There was <a href=/people/2909 target=_blank>Panthous</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=person long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> senator; he had not yet ceased from menacing the safety of the Greeks. And <a href=/people/2577 target=_blank>Thymoetes</a> the counsellor was thinking of some elaborate plan, plunged in the sea of silence. Verily he seemed to be yet meditating some design to help the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>. <a href=/people/1632 target=_blank>Lampon</a> was like one vexed; for his mind had no more the power of giving birth to healing counsel to keep off from the sore-worn <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> the wave of war that was to overwhelm them. <a href=/people/1521 target=_blank>Clytius</a> stood at a loss, his clasped hands heralding hidden trouble. <br />ISOCRATES: Hail, <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a>, light of rhetoric! For thou adornest the bronze, seeming to be revealing some wise counsels even though thou art wrought of mute brass. <br />AMPHIARAUS: <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>, his fiery hair crowned with laurel, was sighing, musing on a secret sorrow, foreseeing that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, founded where lay the heifer, shall be the death of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>' home-coming. <br />AGLAUS: The prophet <a href=/people/5373 target=_blank>Aglaus</a> stood there, who, they say, was the father of the inspired seer <a href=/people/2654 target=_blank>Polyidus</a>: he was crowned with leafy laurel. <br /><a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>: There I saw the far-shooter with unshorn hair, I saw the lord of song, his head adorned with locks that bloomed in freedom: for a naturally-curling tress hung on each shoulder. He rolled his prophetic eyes as if he were freeing men from trouble by his oracular power. <br />AJAX: All naked was stout-hearted Telamonian <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a>, beardless as yet, the bloom of his native beauty all his ornament; his hair was bound with a diadem, for he wore not his helmet, and wielded no sword, nor was his seven-hide shield on his shoulders, but he exhibited the dauntless valour of his father <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a>. <br />SARPEDON: There stood <a href=/people/1279 target=_blank>Sarpedon</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=demonym long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycian</a> leader; terrible was he in his might; his chin was just marked with tender down at the point. Over his hair he wore a helmet. He was nude, but his beauty indicated the parentage of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, for from his eyes shone the light of a noble sire. <br />APOLLO: Next was a third <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, the fair-haired speaker from the tripod, beautiful to see; for his curls fell over both his shoulders, and the lovely beauty of a god was manifest in him, adorning the bronze; his eyes were intent, as if he were gazing from his seat on the mantic tripod. <br />APHRODITE: And here was a third <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> to marvel at, her bosom draped: on her breasts rested the twisted cestus, and in it beauty swam. <br />ACHILLES: Divine <a href=/people/17 target=_blank>Achilles</a> was beardless and not clothed in armour, but the artist had given him the gesture of brandishing a spear in his right hand and of holding a shield in his left. Whetted by daring courage he seemed to be scattering the threatening cloud of battle, for his eyes shone with the genuine light of a son of <a href=/people/255 target=_blank>Aeacus</a>. <br />HERMES: There, too, was <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> with his rod of gold. He was standing, but was tying with his right hand the lace of his winged shoe, eager to start on his way. His right leg was already bent, over it was extended his left hand and his face was upturned to the sky, as if he were listening to the orders of his father. <br />APULEIUS: <a href=/people/2034 target=_blank>Apuleius</a> was seated considering the unuttered secrets of the Latin intellectual <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a>. Him the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=person long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italian</a> <a href=/people/605 target=_blank>Siren</a> nourished, a devotee of ineffable wisdom. <br />ARTEMIS: There stood maiden <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, the sister of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a>, who haunteth the mountains: but she carried no bow, no quiver on her back. She had girt up to her knees her maiden tunic with its rich border, and her unsnooded hair floated loose in the wind. <br />HOMER: <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s statue seemed alive, not lacking thought and intellect, but only it would seem his ambrosial voice; the poetic frenzy was revealed in him. Verily some god cast the bronze and wrought this portrait; for I do not believe that any man seated by the forge was its smith, but that wise <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athene</a> herself wrought it with her hands, knowing the form which she once inhabited; for she herself dwelt in Homeland uttered his skilled song. The companion of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, my father, the godlike being, divine <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> stood there in the semblance of an old man, but his old age was sweet, and shed more grace on him. He was endued with a reverend and kind bearing, and majesty shone forth from his form. His clustering grey hair, tossed back, trailed over his bent neck, and wandered loose about his ears, and he wore a broad beard, soft and round; for it was not pointed, but hung down in all its breadth, weaving an ornament for his naked bosom and his loveable face. His forehead was bare, and on it sat Temperance, the nurse of Youth. The discerning artist had made his eyebrows prominent, and not without reason, for his eyes were sightless. Yet to look at he was not like a blind man; for grace dwelt in his empty eyes.

In all he looked like a clear-seeing prophet; yet he was no prophet, but being the martial spouse of <a href=/people/1123 target=_blank>Alcmena</a>, mother of a great son, he had set the crown on his pleated tresses to signify his victory over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387208ITap class=ethnic long=20.77 lat=38.652>Taphians</a>. <br />THUCYDIDES: <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> was wielding his intellect, weaving, as it seemed, one of the speeches of his history.

The proems were spoken after the frequent recitations given at that time. I suppose, Sirs, that you are so glutted with this banquet of various literary dishes that the food you eat continues to rise. Indeed ye sit crammed with dainties, for many have served up to you a mixed feast of precious and varied discourse and persuade you to look with contempt on ordinary fare. What shall I do now? Shall I allow what I had prepared to lie uneaten and spoil, or shall I expose it in the middle of the market for sale to retail dealers at any price it will fetch? Who in that case will want any part of my wares or who would give twopence for my writings, unless his ears were stopped up? But I have a hope that you may partake of my work kindly and not indifferently; for it is a habit with you to estimate the fare of a feast by the host's desire to please alone. <br />Besides, I am going to serve you a meal to which many new flavourings contribute. For since it is not possible for you to enjoy food worthy of you by my own exertions alone, I have persuaded many to share the trouble and expense and join with me in feasting you more sumptuously. Indeed the rich gave me abundantly of their affluence, and accepting this I take quite sincere pride in their dainties. And one of them pointing at me may say aptly to another, I recently kneaded fresh poetical dough, and what he serves is of my kneading. Thus one but not the wisest of those skilled cooks may say, thanks to whom I alone am thought to be the lord of such a rich feast. For I myself have had the courage to make a slender contribution from my own resources so as not to seem an entire stranger to my guests. I introduce a small portion of each poet, just to taste; but if anyone wishes to have all the rest and take his fill of it, he must seek it in the market. <br />To add ornament to my work I will begin my preface with the Emperor's praise, for thus all will continue under good auspices. As I sing of very great matters, may it be mine to find words equally exalted. <br />(<a href=/people/1665 target=_blank>Praise</a> of <a href=/people/706 target=_blank>Justinian</a>) Let no barbarian, freeing himself from the yokestrap that passes under his neck, dare to fix his gaze on our King, the mighty warrior; nor let any weak <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> woman raise her veil and look straight at him, but, kneeling on the ground and bending the proud arch of her neck, let her come uncalled and submit to Roman justice.

But without fraud or the dark hell-broth the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=demonym long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a> giant fell before our shafts.

I performed this task for you; for you I prepared this work, collecting in one volume the sweet merchandise of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bee</a> that visits many blossoms; gathering such a bunch of varied flowers from the elegy, I planted a wreath of poetic eloquence to offer you, as one offering beech-leaves to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> or ships to the <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a>-shaker, or a breastplate to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> or a quiver to <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, or a lyre to <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Hermes</a> or grapes to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>. For I know that the dedication to <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a> will instil eternal glory into this work of my study. I will first select for you, competing with men of old time, all that the parents of the new song wrote as an offering to the old gods. For it was meet to adhere to the wise model of the ancient writers. After those again comes a more ambitious collection of all our pens wrote either in places or on wellwrought statues or on the other widely distributed performances of laborious Art. The third starting-point of the young book is occupied, as far as it was allowed us, by what God granted us to write on tombs in verse but adhering to the truth. Next what we wrote on the devious paths of life and the deceitful balance of inconstant <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, behold at the fourth base-line of the book. Yea, and perhaps you may be pleased by the charm of a fifth contest, where waxing abusive we wrote scurrilous rhyme, and <a href=/people/1067 target=_blank>Cytherea</a> may steal a sixth book of verse, turning our path aside to elegiac converse and sweet love. Finally in a seventh honey-comb you will find the joys of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> and tipsy dances and wine and cups and rich banquets. </p>                        </div>

If you seek him in the streets, you will repent the courtesan's greed for gold and luxury. If you approach a maiden's bed, it must end in lawful wedlock or punishment for seduction. Who would endure to awake reluctant desire for his lawful wife, forced to do a duty? Adulterous intercourse is the worst of all and has no part in love, and unnatural sin should be ranked with it. As for widows, if one of them is ill-conducted, she is anyone's mistress, and knows all the arts of harlotry, while if she is chaste she with difficulty consents, she is pricked by loveless remorse, hates what she has done, and having a remnant of shame shrinks from the union till she is disposed to announce its end. If you associate with your own servant, you must make up your mind to change places and become hers, and if with someone else's, the law which prosecutes for outrage on slaves not one's own will mark you with infamy. <a href=/people/99 target=_blank>Diogenes</a> escaped all this and sang the marriage hymn to his palm, not craving for <a href=/people/620 target=_blank>Lais</a>. </p>                        </div>
