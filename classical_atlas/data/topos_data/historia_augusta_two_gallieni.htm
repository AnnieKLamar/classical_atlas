But greater far was the grief of them all that now having received the imperial power, <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, by his mode of life, as his father by his fate, brought ruin on the commonwealth. <br /> So then, when <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> and Volusianus were consuls, <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> and Ballista met together, called in the remains of the army, and, since the Roman power in the East was tottering, sought someone to appoint as emperor. For <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> was showing himself so careless of public affairs that his name was not even mentioned to the soldiers. 3 It was then finally decided to choose <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> and his sons as emperors and to undertake the defence of the state. And so the imperial power was offered to <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a>. 4 Now the reasons why <a href=/people/3204 target=_blank>Macrianus</a> and his sons should be chosen to rule were these: First of all, no one of the generals of that time was held to be wiser, and none more suited to govern the state; in the second place, he was the richest, and could by his private fortune make good the public losses. 5 In addition to this, his sons, most valiant young men, rushed with all spirit into the war, ready to serve as an example to the legions in all the duties of soldiers. </p>                        </div>

After this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> was assigned to <a href=/people/679 target=_blank>Theodotus</a>.

This disaster, indeed, was worst in the cities of <a href=/people/4027 target=_blank>Asia</a>; 4 but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, too, was shaken and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> also was shaken. In many places the earth yawned open, and salt water appeared in the fissures. 5 Many cities were even overwhelmed by the sea. Therefore the favour of the gods was sought by consulting the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline Books</a>, and, according to their command, sacrifices were made to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Salutaris. For so great a pestilence, too, had arisen in both <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaea</a> that in one single day five thousand men died of the same disease. <br />6 While <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a> thus raged, and while here earthquakes, there clefts in the ground, and in divers places pestilence, devastated the Roman world, while <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> was held in captivity and the provinces of Gaul were, for the most part, beset, while <a href=/people/11043 target=_blank>Odaenathus</a> was threatening war, <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a> pressing hard on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and <a href=/people/1261 target=_blank>Aemilianus</a> in possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, a portion of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a> . . . which name, as has previously been related, was given to the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, having seized <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> and plundered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, laid siege to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, and nowhere was hope of peace held out, even to a slight degree. 7 All these things, as I have frequently said, were done out of contempt for <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, a man given over to luxury and ever ready, did he feel free from danger, for any disgraceful deed. </p>                        </div>

This measure the senate, the city, and men of every age received with approval. <br />2 <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, furthermore, was exceedingly clever, and I wish to relate a few actions of his in order to show his wit. 3 Once, when a huge <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> was led into the arena, and a huntsman came forth to fight him but was unable to slay the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> though it was brought out ten times, he sent the huntsman a garland, 4 and when all the crowd wondered what it might mean that so foolish a fellow should be crowned with a garland, he bade a herald announce: It is a difficult thing to miss a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> so many times. 5 On another occasion, when a certain man sold his wife glass jewels instead of real, and she, discovering the fraud, wished the man to be punished, he ordered the seller to be haled off, as though to a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, and then had them let out from the cage a capon, and when all were amazed at so absurd a proceeding, he bade the herald proclaim: He practised deceit and then had it practised on him.

But being unable to endure further all the iniquities of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcianus</a> and Heraclianus formed a plan that one of them should take the imperial power. . . . . . . 2 And <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, in fact, was chosen, the best man of all, as we shall narrate in the proper place. He had had no part in their plan, but was held by all in such respect that he seemed worthy of the imperial power, and justly so, as was proved by later events. 3 For he is that <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> from whom <a href=/people/136 target=_blank>Constantius</a>, our most watchful Caesar, derives his descent. 4 These men had also as their comrade in seeking the power a certain Ceronius, or rather Cecropius, commander of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=ethnic long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatians</a>, who aided them with the greatest shrewdness and wisdom. 5 But being unable to seize the power while <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> was still alive, they decided to proceed against him by a plot of the following nature, purposing, now that the state was exhausted by disasters, to remove this most evil blot from the governance of the human race and to save the commonwealth, now given over to the theatre and circus, from going to destruction through the allurements of pleasure. 6 Now the nature of their plot was as follows: <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> was at enmity with <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a>, who had seized upon the position of prince, and was daily expecting the coming of this usurping ruler — a serious and, indeed, an unendurable thing. 7 Being aware of this, <a href=/people/3042 target=_blank>Marcianus</a> and Cecropius suddenly caused word to be sent to <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> that <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a> was now approaching. 8 He, therefore, mustered his soldiers and went forth as though to certain battle, and so was slain by the murderers sent for the purpose. 9 It is reported, indeed, that <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> was pierced by the spear of Cecropius, the Dalmatian commander, some say near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/455092UMed class=place long=9.189 lat=45.4634>Milan</a>, where also his brother <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> was at once put to death. This man, many say, had the title of Augustus, and many, that of Caesar, and many, again, neither one — 10 which, indeed, is not probable, for we have found written in the official lists, after <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> had been taken prisoner, During the consulship of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> the Emperor. So who else, pray, could this <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> have been but the brother of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>? 11 There is general agreement concerning his family, but not concerning his rank or, as others have begun to say, concerning his imperial majesty. </p>                        </div>

This statement I have added for the reason that many have said that he was killed in the ninth year of his rule. 6 There were, moreover, other rebels during his reign, as we shall relate in the proper place; for it is our purpose to include twenty pretenders in one single book, since there is not much to be told about them, and many things have already been said in the Life of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>. <br />7 It will suffice, meanwhile, to have told in this book these facts concerning <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>; for much has already been said in the Life of <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, and other things shall be told in the book which is to be entitled Concerning the Thirty Pretenders, and these it seems useless to repeat here and relate too often. 8 It must also be added that I have even omitted some facts on purpose, lest his descendants should be offended by the publication of many details. </p>                        </div>

And this gave rise to the custom that always thereafter they should dine with the emperor belted. 5 I cannot, indeed, deny that many believe this custom had a different origin; for, they say, at the soldiers' ration (prandium) — which they called a preparation (parandium) because it prepares them for fighting — men come in wearing belts, and the proof of this statement is that with the emperor men still dine unbelted. These details I have given because they seemed worthy of being related and known. </p>                        </div>

With regard to them I need tell but a few things and briefly; 2 for most of them are not worthy of having even their names put into a book, although some of them seem to have had no little merit and even to have been of much benefit to the state. <br />3 Various, indeed, are the opinions concerning the name of Saloninus, but the author who believes he speaks most truthfully declares that he was named from his mother Salonina, whom <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> loved to distraction. He loved also a barbarian maid, Pipara by name, the daughter of a king. 4 And for this reason <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a>, moreover, and those about him always dyed their hair yellow. <br />5 With regard to the number of years through which the rule of <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> and <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> extended, such varied statements are made that, whereas all agree that together they ruled for fifteen years, that is, that <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> himself attained to his fifteenth year, while <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a> was captured in his sixth, some have set down in writing that <a href=/people/2746 target=_blank>Gallienus</a> ruled for nine years, and others, again, that it was almost ten — while, on the other hand, it is generally known that he celebrated a decennial festival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and that after this festival he defeated the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, made peace with <a href=/people/11043 target=_blank>Odaenathus</a>, entered into friendly relations with <a href=/people/11049 target=_blank>Aureolus</a>, warred against <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> and against <a href=/people/3622 target=_blank>Lollianus</a>, and did many things that mark a virtuous life, but more that tend to dishonour. 6 For he used to frequent public-houses at night, it is said, and spent his life with pimps and actors and jesters. </p>                        </div>
