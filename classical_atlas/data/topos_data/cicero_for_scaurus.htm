Oh for that ancient and severe censor; according to whom even a man who had attained the highest honours of the state, and who was one of the chief men in it, was not allowed to have a convenient or splendid house] <br /> ****especially when its nearness to the street, and the populous character of its situation, must remove from him all suspicion of laziness or ambition. ****** <br />[ But in what an arrogant way, O <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a>, did your oration go on, when you said that such enormous masses of <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>'s marbles and pillars, which we now see placed in <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>'s hall, were carried through the city, past the plaster ornaments on the tops of the temples of the gods, to a private house, — that the contractor for keeping the drains in repair had a claim for the damage done by dragging them up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LPal class=place long=12.4884 lat=41.8896>Palatine</a> Hill in wagons. I suppose those pillars which are thus held up to odium were carried there solely for the purpose of gratifying the pride of individuals, which the Roman people detests, and not for the sake of being a public ornament to the city, which it approves of. Are you the only man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> ignorant that <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> used those pillars when he was aedile for the ornamenting of the theatre, in order that, by the magnificence of his exhibition, and by his great liberality devoted in that manner to the honour of the immortal gods, he might increase the religious reverence with which the games were observed by the splendour of his preparation?] *** ***Moreover, I, who have pillars of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> marble, brought them up in panniers! *** <br />[ What? what vast and what prodigal expense did you yourself, O <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a>, incur in procuring pillars!] ***For this I do marvel at and of this I do complain, — that any man should be so anxious to do injury to another by his words, as to bore holes in the ship in which he himself is sailing. *** ***Were you in want of a house? You had one. Had you too much money? You were in want of money. But you went mad after pillars. You were frantic to get hold of what belonged to other people. You valued a pulled down, windowless, destroyed house, at a greater price than yourself and all your fortunes. *** </p>                        </div>

Suppose <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> had appealed to you as an arbitrator, to decide “whether you had not gone to much greater expense, whether you had not committed much greater extravagance in proportion to your income, for pillars than he had,” would it have been necessary to go through the formalities of a trial to decide whether he had been guilty of prodigality, who, being possessed of a most ample estate, and of great family wealth and reputation, had set off his dignity with a fine house, or he who, when he was over head and ears in debt before, had sought to obtain dignity by building a house?] *** <br />As it would not be possible for you to escape this argument, will you still argue and demand that Marcus <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a>, with all his own dignity, — with the splendid memory of his father, — with the renown of his grandfather, be sacrificed to a most sordid, fickle and insignificant nation, and to a lot of (I had almost said) barbarian witnesses? *** ***Wherever I turn, not only my thoughts, but even my eyes, every place supplies me with arguments to advance in favour of Marcus <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>. That senate-house bears witness to you of the fearless and dignified way in which his father held the post of the chief man of the city. Lucius <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> himself, his grandfather, appears, O judges, to have placed those most holy gods in that temple in your sight, that they might gain from you the safety of his grandson by their entreaties, as they have, before now, often aided by their divine assistance many other men in distress who implored their help. That <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, adorned with three temples, — the approaches to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SJCa class=place long=12.4823 lat=41.8924>temples</a> of the all-good and all-powerful <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SJuM class=place long=12.4835 lat=41.894>that</a>of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a> the queen, and of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, adorned by most magnificent presents of this man's father and of himself; defend Marcus <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> [before you now by the recollection of this munificence and liberality to the public, from every suspicion of avarice or covetousness. That <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SVes class=place long=12.48621 lat=41.89171>temple of Vesta</a>, which is close at hand, warns you to keep it in your minds.] That great Lucius <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, the Pontifex <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>, who, when that temple was on fire threw himself into the middle of the flames, and saved from the fire that <a href=/people/12046 target=_blank>image of Minerva</a>, which, as if it were a pledge of our safety and of the empire, is guarded by the protection of <a href=/people/325 target=_blank>Vesta</a>; — would that that great man could be among us, though but for a short time; he, forsooth, would save from the flames this man, his descendant, as he before saved from that other conflagration that heavenly pledge of our safety. I am moved by the thought that the gods should be so little propitious to a priest, that even though they were saved by him, they do not preserve his race which was recommended by him to their protection. But as for you, O Marcus <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, I see you, I do not merely think of you; nor, indeed, is it without great distress and grief of mind that I do call you to mind when I behold the mournful appearance of your son. </p>                        </div>
