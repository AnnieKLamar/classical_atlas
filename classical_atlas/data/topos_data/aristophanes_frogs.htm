If there be any whom the artifices of <a href=/people/456 target=_blank>Phrynichus</a> have drawn into any error, let us allow them to offer their excuses and let us forget these old mistakes.

Note how useful, even from remotest times, the poets of noble thought have been! <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> taught us the mystic rites and the horrid nature of murder; <a href=/people/905 target=_blank>Musaeus</a>, the healing of ailments and the oracles; <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a>, the tilling of the soil and the times for delving and harvest. And does not divine <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> owe his immortal glory to his noble teachings? Is it not he who taught the warlike virtues, the art of fighting and of carrying arms? <br />DIONYSUS: At all events he has not taught it to <a href=/people/4644 target=_blank>Pantacles</a>, the most awkward of all men; t'other day, when he was directing a procession, 'twas only after he had put on his helmet that he thought of fixing in the crest. <br />AESCHYLUS: But he has taught a crowd of brave warriors, such as <a href=/people/712 target=_blank>Lamachus</a>, the hero of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. 'Tis from <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> that I borrowed the Patrocli and the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>-hearted <a href=/people/10371 target=_blank>Teucers</a>, whom I revived to the citizens, to incite them to show themselves worthy of these illustrious examples when the trumpets sounded. But I showed them neither <a href=/people/8339 target=_blank>Sthenoboea</a> nor shameless <a href=/people/953 target=_blank>Phaedra</a>; and I don't remember ever having placed an amorous woman on the stage. <br />EURIPIDES: No, no, you have never known <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>. <br />AESCHYLUS: And I am proud of it. Whereas with you and those like you, she appears everywhere and in every shape; so that even you yourself were ruined and undone by her. <br />DIONYSUS: That's true; the crimes you imputed to the wives of others, you suffered from in turn. <br />EURIPIDES: But, cursed man, what harm have my Sthenoboeas done to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>? <br />AESCHYLUS: You are the cause of honest wives of honest citizens drinking hemlock, so greatly have your Bellerophons made them blush. <br />EURIPIDES: Why, did I invent the story of <a href=/people/953 target=_blank>Phaedra</a>? <br />AESCHYLUS: No, the story is true enough; but the poet should hide what is vile and not produce nor represent it on the stage. The schoolmaster teaches little children and the poet men of riper age. We must only display what is good. </p>                        </div>

I ennobled the stage, while you have degraded it. <br />EURIPIDES: And how so, pray? <br />AESCHYLUS: Firstly you have dressed the kings in rags, so that they might inspire pity. <br />EURIPIDES: Where's the harm? <br />AESCHYLUS: You are the cause why no rich man will now equip the galleys, they dress themselves in tatters, groan and say they are poor. <br />DIONYSUS: Aye, by <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Demeter</a>! and he wears a tunic of fine wool underneath; and when he has deceived us with his lies, he may be seen turning up on the fish-market. <br />AESCHYLUS: Moreover, you have taught boasting and quibbling; the wrestling schools are deserted and the young fellows have submitted their arses to outrage, in order that they might learn to reel off idle chatter, and the sailors have dared to bandy words with their officers. In my day they only knew how to ask for their ship's-biscuit and to shout Yo ho! heave ho! <br />DIONYSUS: ... and to let wind under the nose of the rower below them, to befoul their mate with filth and to steal when they went ashore. Nowadays they argue instead of rowing and the ship can travel as slow as she likes. <br />AESCHYLUS: Of what crimes is he not the author? Has he not shown us procurers, women who give birth in sanctuaries, have traffic with their brothers, and say that life is not life.

But don't keep always to the same ground; you are not at the end of your specious artifices. Make use of every trick you have, no matter whether it be old or new! Out with everything boldly, blunt though it be; risk anything — that is smart and to the point. Perchance you fear that the audience is too stupid to grasp your subtleties, but be reassured, for that is no longer the case.

Carry this rope from me to <a href=/people/1621 target=_blank>Cleophon</a>, this one to Myrmex and <a href=/people/9888 target=_blank>Nichomachus</a>, the public receivers, and this other one to Archenomous. Bid them come here at once and without delay; if not, by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, I will brand them with the hot iron. I will make one bundle of them and <a href=/people/1551 target=_blank>Adimantus</a>, the son of Leucolophus, and despatch the lot into hell with all possible speed. <br />AESCHYLUS: I will do your bidding, and do you make <a href=/people/131 target=_blank>Sophocles</a> occupy my seat. Let him take and keep it for me, against I should ever return here. In fact I award him the second place among the tragic poets. As for this impostor, watch that he never usurps my throne, even should he be placed there in spite of himself. <br />PLUTO (to the Chorus of the Initiate). Escort him with your sacred torches, singing to him as you go his own hymns and choruses. </p>                        </div>
