Upon those who returned home there came a countless number of <a href=/people/10983 target=_blank>frogs</a>, which filled the streams and polluted the water. The noxious vapors rising from the ground caused a plague among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> which was especially fatal to the Autarienses. At last they fled from their homes, and as the plague still clung to them (and for fear of it nobody would receive them), they came, after a journey of twenty-three days, to a marshy and uninhabited district of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>, where they settled near the <a href=/people/1286 target=_blank>Bastarnae</a>. The god visited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> with an earthquake and overthrew their cities, and did not abate the calamity until these also fled from their abodes and made an incursion into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyria</a> among their fellow-culprits, who had been weakened by the plague. While robbing the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a> they caught the plague and again took to flight and plundered their way to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a>. When they were returning to the east the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, mindful of their former encounters with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a>, and fearful lest they should cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/441073LAlp class=place long=7.343 lat=44.142>Alps</a> and invade <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, sent against them both consuls, who were annihilated with the whole army. This calamity to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> brought great dread of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=ethnic long=7 lat=49>Celts</a> upon all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> until <a href=/people/11011 target=_blank>Gaius</a> <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, who had lately triumphed over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> and Mauritanians, was chosen commander and defeated the <a href=/people/946 target=_blank>Cimbri</a> repeatedly with great slaughter, as I have related in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490070RKel class=demonym long=7 lat=49>Celtic</a> history.

When <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> advanced against them they made an alliance with each other for mutual aid in war. They had upwards of 12,000 fighting men under a general named Versus. He occupied Promona, the city of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/440154RLib class=ethnic long=15.4 lat=44>Liburni</a>, and fortified it, although it was very strong by nature. It is a mountain stronghold surrounded on all sides by sharp-pointed hills like saw-teeth. The greater part of his forces were stationed in the town, but he placed guards on the [B.C. 34] hills and all of them looked down upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> from elevated positions. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> in plain sight began to draw a wall around the whole, but secretly he sent his bravest men to seek a path to the highest of the hills. These, concealing themselves in the woods, fell upon the guards by night while they were asleep, slew them, and signalled to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> in the twilight. He led the bulk of the army to make an attempt upon the city, and sent another force to hold the height that had been taken, while the captors of it should get possession of the lower hills. <a href=/people/1731 target=_blank>Terror</a> and confusion fell upon the barbarians everywhere, for they believed themselves to be attacked on all sides. Especially were those on the hills alarmed lest they should be cut off from their supply of water, for which reason they all fled to Promona.</p>                        </div>

When Testimus, another Dalmatian general, brought an army to the relief of the place <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> met him and drove him back to the mountains, and while Testimus was still looking on he took Promona before the line of circumvallation was finished. For when the citizens made a sally and were sharply repulsed, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> pursued them and entered the town with them, where they killed a third part of them. The remainder took refuge in the citadel, at the gates of which a Roman cohort was placed to keep watch. On the fourth night the barbarians asaulted them, and they fled terror-stricken from the gates. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> repulsed the enemy's assault, and the following day received their surrender. The cohort that had abandoned its position was obliged to cast lots, and every tenth man suffered death. The lot fell upon two centurions among others. It was ordered, as a further punishment, that the surviving members of the cohort should subsist on barley instead of wheat for that summer.</p>                        </div>

For this reason the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> were not able to pursue them long, as they feared to divide themselves into small bands, being ignorant of the roads, and the foot-prints of the fugitives being much confused. They took the town of Sunodium at the edge of the forest in which the army of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> had been entrapped by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=ethnic long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatians</a> in a long and deep gorge between two mountains.

He cut down trees and captured and burned all the towns he found on his way. While he was besieging the city of Setovia a force of barbarians came to its assistance, which he met and prevented from entering the place.

And now the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=ethnic long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatians</a>, oppressed by hunger and cut off from foreign supplies, met him on the road and delivered themselves up with supplications, giving 700 of their children as hostages, as <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> demanded, and also the Roman standards taken from <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>. They also promised to pay the tribute that had been in arrears since the time of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Gaius Caesar</a> and to be obedient henceforth. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> deposited the standards in the portico called the <a href=/people/722 target=_blank>Octavia</a>.

Some, however, he was prevented by sickness from reaching. These gave no hostages and made no treaties. It appears, however, that they were subjugated later.
