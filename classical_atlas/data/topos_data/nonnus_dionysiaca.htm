And while the <a href=/people/11034 target=_blank>Giant</a> waged his war, his hurtling arms drew near to the stars, and obscured the sun, as they attacked <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympos</a>, and cast the precipitous crag. </p>                        </div>

The thunderbolts felt the hands of a novice, and all their manly blaze was unmanned.

You shall have ample recompense for your song: I will establish your face in the starlit circle of heaven, and join your tuneful pipes to the heavenly Harp.

If you have a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>-master brother who can manage a team, let him take <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>' fiery four-in-hand. If you want to wield the goatskin cape of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, being a goatherd, I will make you a present of that too.

As the female stone is struck by the male stone, one stone on another brings flame to birth, while crushed and beaten it produces from itself a shower of sparks: so the heavenly fire is kindled in clouds and murk crushed and beaten, but from earthy smoke, which is naturally thin, the winds are brought forth. There is another floating vapour, drawn from the waters, which the sun shining full on them with fiery rays milks out and draws up dewy through the boiling track of air.

They ripened together, one letting its halfgrown nursery increase with different shades of purple upon the fruit, one spotted with white, in colour like foam; some of golden hue crowded thick neighbour on neighbour, others with dark bloom all over like pitch – and the wineteeming foliage intoxicated all the olives with their glorious fruit which grew beside them.

He used to drag innocent strangers to death against all right, and cut off with steel human heads, which he hung over his gateway in festoons. He was like Oinomaos and of the same age. Oinomaos kept his unhappy daughter unmarried in his house, without husband, growing old and yet unacquainted with wedded love, until Tantalides came scoring the highroad of the deep in <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Earthshaker</a>'s fourhorse chariot unwetted. Then came his race for a bride; then cunningminded <a href=/people/2957 target=_blank>Myrtilos</a> got him a stolen victory, by making for the wheel a sham axle of wax to deceive — for he was himself in love with sorrowful <a href=/people/1389 target=_blank>Hippodameia</a> and pitied her.

For the second, a bay mare swift as the north wind, with long mane overshadowing her neck, still in foal and gone half her time and her belly swollen with the burden her mate had begotten.

This was a masterpiece made on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399253ILem class=demonym long=25.21 lat=39.93>Lemnian</a> anvil and adorned with gold patterns; the round boss in the middle was wrought with silver ornaments.

Next after him came Phaunos flogging his fourhorse team. Fourth was <a href=/people/583 target=_blank>Actaion</a> the cunning and artful, who had not forgotten his father's good advice; and the last was Tyrsenian Achates. <br />Now bold <a href=/people/583 target=_blank>Actaion</a> thought of a cunning plan. His car was just behind Phaunos and catching him up, when with a sharper cut of the whip, he turned his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> aside and drove them up level, slipping by the driver and getting a little in front, then pressing his knees against the rail, he scraped the rival car nth his own crossing car and scratched the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>'s legs with his running wheel.

The torch of love was stronger than the blaze of his car and the shining of his rays, when over the bend of the reddened Ocean as he bathed his fiery form in the eastern waters, he beheld the maiden close by the way, while she swam naked and sported in her father's waves. Her body gleamed in her bath, she was one like the full Moon reflected in the evening waters, when she has filled the compass of her twin horns with light. Half-seen, unshod, the girl stood in the waves shooting the rosy shafts from her cheeks at <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>; her shape was outlined in the waters, no stomacher hid her maiden bosom, but the glowing circle of her round silvery breasts illuminated the stream. <br /> Her father united the girl to the heavenly charioteer.

The light that shone on that bridal bed came from the starry train; and the star of <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a>, <a href=/people/11021 target=_blank>Lucifer</a>, herald of the union, wove a bridal song.

Then he made a clever imitation of the morning star round like a wheel, out of a bunch of white flowers, and fixed it in front of his spokewheeled waggon to show the shape of the star <a href=/people/11021 target=_blank>Lucifer</a>. He set burning torches standing about his hair on every side, and mimicked his father with fictitious rays as he drove round and round the coast of the seagirt isle. <br /> But when he grew up into the fair bloom of youth, he often touched his father's fire, lifted with his little hand the hot yokestraps and the starry whip, busied himself with the wheel, stroked the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>' coats with snow-white hands — and so the playful boy enjoyed himself.

Now I cherished a passion of love for that city; so I took the shadowed form of a human face, and stayed my step overhanging the head of these earthborn folk, and spoke to them my oracle in words of inspiration: Shake off idle sleep, sons of the soil!

Speechless for a time, <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a> kept her lips sealed with silence; the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> the companion of <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a> shared her feelings, he whimpered and howled by the side of his mourning mistress, sorrowing with her sorrow. Wildly she ran up to a tall tree: she tied upon it a rope with a noose fast about her neck and hung herself high in the air, twisting in self-sought agonies with her two twitching feet. So she died, and had a willing fate; her <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> ran round and round the girl with sorrowful howls, a dumb animal dropping tears of sympathy from his eyes. <br />The <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> would not leave his mistress alone, unguarded, but there he stayed by the tree, and chased off the preying beasts, panther or <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>. Then wayfarers passed, and he showed with mute gestures the unwedded maid hanging in the tree with a noose about her neck. Full of pity they came up to the tree on tiptoe, and took down the chaste maiden from the leafy branches; then hollowed a grave close by with earthdigging shovels. The sorrowing <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> knew what they did, and helped them, scratching and scattering the surface of the soil with sharp claws and grubbing with clever feet. So the wayfarers buried the body but lately dead, and they went away on their business quickfoot with a weight of sorrow under their hearts one and all. But the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> remained near the tomb alone, for love of <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a>, and there he died of his own free will. <br />Father <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> had pity, and he placed <a href=/people/1213 target=_blank>Erigone</a> in the company of the stars near the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>'s back. </p>                        </div>

Her body was uncovered, but for the long tresses of the abundant hair which flowed loose over the girl's neck. Her legs were visible, and the curve of her thighs uncovered with the part above the knee bare, but a white wrap fitted close over the thighs to cover her nakedness. Her skin had been well rubbed with fat oil, and her arms more than all, that she might slip out easily if her body were pressed in a grasp too strong to loosen. <br />She came up to Lyaios her eager wooer with rough threatening words, and threw her two arms with a swing linking them round his neck; <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchos</a> just threw back his neck with the woman's fetters about it, and shook it loose again, throwing off the girl's tender fingers. Then he put his two arms round her waist like a girdle, and shook her from side to side by movements of his feet. He grasped a rosy palm, and felt comfort for his love as he squeezed the snowwhite hand. He did not wish so much to give the maid a throw as to touch the soft flesh, entranced with his delightful task; he used all his guile, panting with labouring breath, as if he were a mortal, delaying victory on purpose.
