For when, to most authors who write the history only of particular princes or nations, their task appears an affair of arduous effort, must not <a href=/people/2553 target=_blank>Trogus</a> <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, in attempting the whole world, seem to have acted with a boldness like that of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, since in his books are contained the actions of all ages, monarchs, nations, and people? All that the historians of Greece had undertaken separately, according to what was suitable to each, <a href=/people/2553 target=_blank>Trogus</a> <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, omitting only what was useless, has put together in one narration, everything being assigned to its proper period, and arranged in the regular order of events. From these forty-four volumes therefore (for such was the number that he published), I have extracted, during the leisure that I enjoyed in the city, whatever was most worthy of being known; and, rejecting such parts as were neither attractive for the pleasure of reading, nor necessary by way of example, have formed, as it were, a small collection of flowers, that those who are acquainted with the history of Greece might have something to refresh their memories, and those who are strangers to it something for their instruction. This work I have sent to you, not so much that it may add to your knowledge, as that it may receive your correction; and that, at the same time, the account of my leisure, of which <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> thinks that an account must be given, may stand fair with you. For your approbation is sufficient for me for the present, with the expectation of receiving from posterity, when the malice of detraction has died away, an ample testimony to my diligence. </p>                        </div>

The people were not then bound by any laws; the wills of their princes were instead of laws. It was their custom to defend, rather than advance, the boundaries of their empire. The dominions of each were confined within his own country. <br />The first of all princes, who, from an extravagant desire of ruling, changed this old and, as it were, hereditary custom, was <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. It was he who first made war upon his neighbours, and subdued the nations, as yet too barbarous to resist him, as far as the frontiers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> <a href=/people/1486 target=_blank>Sesostris</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and Tanaus, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>, were indeed prior to him in time; the one of whom advanced into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, and the other as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>; but these princes engaged in distant wars, not in struggles with their neighbours; they did not seek dominion for themselves, but glory for their people, and, content with victory, declined to govern those whom they subdued. But <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> established the greatness of his acquired dominion by immediately possessing himself of the conquered countries. Overcoming, accordingly, the nearest people, and advancing, fortified with an accession of strength, against others, while each successive victory became the instrument of one to follow, he subjugated the nations of the whole east. His last war was with <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, who is said to have been the first that invented magic arts, and to have investigated, with great attention, the origin of the world and the motions of the stars. After killing <a href=/people/1520 target=_blank>Zoroaster</a>, <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> himself died, leaving a son called <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a>, still a minor, and a wife, whose name was <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>. </p>                        </div>

The stature of both mother and son was low, their voice alike weak, and the cast of their features similar. She accordingly clad her arms and legs in long garments, and decked her head with a turban; and, that she might not appear to conceal any thing by this new dress, she ordered her subjects also to wear the same apparel; a fashion which the whole nation has since retained. Having thus dissembled her sex at the commencement of her reign, she was believed to be a male. She afterwards performed many noble actions; and when she thought envy was overcome by the greatness of them, she acknowledged who she was, and whom she had personated. Nor did this confession detract from her authority as a sovereign, but increased the admiration of her, since she, being a woman, surpassed, not only women, but men, in heroism. <br />It was she that built <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and constructed round the city a wall of burnt brick; bitumen, a substance which everywhere oozes from the ground in those parts, being spread between the bricks instead of mortar. Many other famous acts, too, were performed by this queen; for, not content with preserving the territories acquired by her husband, she added <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> also to her empire; and she even made war upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, into which no prince, except her and <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, ever penetrated. At last, conceiving a criminal passion for her son, she was killed by him, after holding the kingdom two and forty years from the death of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>. <br />Her son <a href=/people/2639 target=_blank>Ninyas</a>, content with the empire acquired by his parents, laid aside the pursuits of war, and, as if he had changed sexes with his mother, was seldom seen by men, but grew old in the company of his women. His successors too, following his example, gave answers to their people through their ministers. The <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, who were afterwards called Syrians, held their empire thirteen hundred years. </p>                        </div>

One of his satraps, named <a href=/people/1614 target=_blank>Arbaces</a>, governor of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, having, with great difficulty and after much solicitation, obtained admission to visit him, found him, among crowds of concubines, and in the dress, of a woman, spinning purple wool with a distaff, and distributing tasks to girls, but surpassing all the women in the effeminacy of his person and the wantonness of his looks. At that sight, feeling indignant that so many men should be subject to one so much of a woman, and that those who bore swords and arms should obey one that handled wool, he proceeded to his companions, and told them what he had seen, protesting that he could not submit to a prince who had rather be a woman than a man. A conspiracy was consequently formed, and war raised against <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapalus</a>; who, hearing of what had occurred, and acting, not like a man that would defend his kingdom, but as women are wont to do under fear of death, first looked about for a hiding-place, but afterwards marched into the field with a few ill-disciplined troops. Being conquered in battle, he withdrew into his palace, and, having raised and set fire to a pile of combustibles, threw himself and his riches into the flames, in this respect only acting like a man.

This prince, in a dream, saw a vine spring from the womb of his only daughter, with the branches of which all Asia was overshadowed. The soothsayers being consulted concerning the vision, replied, that he would have a grandson by that daughter, whose greatness was foreshown, and the loss of <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a>'s kingdom portended. Alarmed at this answer, he gave his daughter in marriage, not to an eminent man, nor to one of his own subjects (lest nobility on the father or mother's side should rouse the spirit of his grandson), but to <a href=/people/214 target=_blank>Cambyses</a>, a man of mean fortune, and of the race of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, which was at that time obscure. But not having, even thus, got rid of his fear of the dream, he sent for his daughter, while she was pregnant, that her child might be put to death under the very eye of his grandfather. The infant, as soon as it was born, was given to <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagus</a>, a friend of the king's and in his secrets, to be killed. <a href=/people/811 target=_blank>Harpagus</a>, fearing that if the crown, on the death of the king (as <a href=/people/578 target=_blank>Astyages</a> had no male issue), should devolve upon his daughter, she might exact from the agent, for the murder of her child, that revenge which she could not inflict on her father, gave the infant to the herdsman of the king's <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> to be exposed. The herdsman, by chance, had a son born at the same time; and his wife, hearing of the exposure of the royal infant, entreated, with the utmost earnestness, that the child might be brought and shown to her. The herdsman, overcome by her solicitations, went back into the wood, and found a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> by the infant, giving it her teats, and protecting it from the beasts and birds of prey. Being moved with pity, with which he saw even a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> moved, he carried the child to the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>-folds, the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> vigilantly following him. When the woman took the babe into her hands, it smiled upon her as if it knew her; and there appeared so much vivacity in it, with a certain sweetness in its smile as it clung to her, that the wife at once entreated the herdsman to expose her own child instead of the other, and to allow her to bring up the royal infant, whether to his own fortune or to her hopes. Thus the lot of the children being changed, the one was brought up as the shepherd's son, and the other exposed as the king's grandson.

Having vigorously renewed the contest, he posted part of his army, while his men were fighting, in their rear, and ordered that those who turned back should be driven on the enemy with the point of the sword; telling them that, 'unless they conquered, they would find men in their rear not less stout than those in their front; and they were therefore to consider whether they would penetrate the one body by fleeing, or the other body by fighting.' In consequence of this obligation to fight, great spirit and vigour was infused into his army.

While they hesitated, they took up their garments, and showed them the secret parts of their persons, asking them, 'if they would shrink back into the wombs of their mothers or their wives.' Checked with this reproach, they returned to the battle, and, making a vigorous assault, compelled those from whom they had fled to flee in their turn.

This lenity was of no less advantage to the conqueror than to the conquered; for when it was known that war was made upon <a href=/people/7544 target=_blank>Craesus</a>, auxiliaries flocked to him from the whole of Greece, as if to extinguish a conflagration that threatened them all; so popular was <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a> in all the Greek cities; and <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> would have incurred a heavy war with Greece, if he had resolved on any severe treatment of <a href=/people/105 target=_blank>Croesus</a>. <br />Some time after, when <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was engaged in other wars, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd class=ethnic long=28 lat=38.5>Lydians</a> rebelled, and, being a second time conquered, their arms and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> were taken from them, and they were compelled to keep taverns, to turn their thoughts to amusements, and open houses of pleasure.

When they reached the camp of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, the youth, inexperienced in military matters, seeming to think he was come to feast and not to fight, paid no attention <br />to the enemy, but allowed his barbarians, who were unused to wine, to overload themselves with it; so that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> were overcome with wine before they were subdued by the enemy; for <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, learning what had happened, and returning in the night, fell upon them unawares, and killed all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> together with the queen's son. <br />But <a href=/people/2458 target=_blank>Tomyris</a>, after losing so great an army, and, what she still more lamented, her only son, did not pour forth her sorrow for her loss in tears, but turned her thoughts to the solace of revenge, and entrapped her enemies, exulting in their recent victory, by a deception and stratagem similar to their own. For, counterfeiting timidity on account of the damage which she had received, and taking to flight, she allured <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> into a narrow defile, where, placing an ambush on the hills, she slew two hundred thousand of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> with their king himself; a triumph in which this also was remarkable, that not a man to tell of such a massacre survived. The queen ordered the head of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> to be cut off and thrown into a vessel full of human blood, adding this exclamation against his cruelty, 'Satiate thyself with blood for which thou hast thirsted, and of which thou hast always been insatiable.' <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> reigned thirty years, and was a man wonderfully distinguished, not only in the beginning of his reign, but during the whole course of his life. </p>                        </div>

The imposition was first suspected by <a href=/people/1452 target=_blank>Otanes</a>, a man of noble birth, and extremely happy in forming conjectures. He accordingly, by the aid of certain agents, inquired of his daughter, who was one of the royal concubines, whether the son of king <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> was now king. She replied that 'she neither knew, nor could learn from any other woman, as all the females were shut up in separate apartments.'

They were so equal in merit and nobility of birth, that their very equality would have rendered it hard for the people to make a selection from them.

It is incredible that they should have resigned, with so much patience, their pretensions to a kingdom, for which, in order to recover it from the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a>, they had not hesitated to expose their lives. However, besides possessing gracefulness of person, and merit deserving of such an empire, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> was related to the preceding kings; and, in the beginning of his reign, he took to wife the daughter of <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, in order to strengthen his kingdom by a royal marriage, so that it might not so much, seem transferred to a stranger, as to be restored to <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>'s family. <br />Some time after, when the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> had revolted and seized upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and the capture of the city proved difficult, so that the king was in great anxiety about it, <a href=/people/1101 target=_blank>Zopyrus</a>, one of the assassins of the <a href=/people/12091 target=_blank>Magi</a>, caused himself to be mangled with stripes, in his own house, over his whole body, and his nose, ears, and lips to be cut off, and in this condition presented himself unexpectedly before the king; when he privately informed <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, who was astonished, and inquired the cause and author of so dire an outrage, with what object he had done it, and, having settled his plan of action for the future, set out for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> in the character of a deserter. There he showed the people his lacerated body; complained of the barbarity of the king, by whom, in the competition for the throne, he had been defeated, not by merit but by fortune, not by the judgment of men but by the neighing of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>; and bade them form an opinion, from his treatment of his friends, what was to be apprehended by his enemies; exhorting them not to trust to their walls more than to their arms, and to allow him, whose resentment was fresher, to carry on the war in common with them. The nobleness and bravery of the man was known to them all; nor did they doubt of his sincerity, of which they had the wounds on his person, and the marks of his ill-usage, as proofs. He was therefore chosen general by the suffrages of all; and, having received a small body of men, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, once or twice, purposely retreating from the field, he fought some successful battles.

As the men were founders of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>, the women settled the kingdom of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>; so that to those who compare the deeds of their males and females, it is difficult to decide which of the sexes was more distinguished. <br />The nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> was always regarded as very ancient; though there was long a dispute between them and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> concerning the antiquity of their respective races; the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> alleging that, 'In the beginning of things, when some countries were parched with the excessive heat of the sun, and others frozen with extremity of cold, so that, in their early condition, they were not only unable to produce human beings, but were incapable even of receiving and supporting such as came from other parts (before coverings for the body were found out against heat and cold, or the inconveniences of countries corrected by artificial remedies), <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> was always so temperate, that neither the cold in winter nor the sun's heat in summer, incommoded its inhabitants; and its soil so fertile, that no land was ever more productive of food for the use of man; and that, consequently, men must reasonably be considered to have been first produced in that country, where they could most easily be nourished.' <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, on the other hand, thought that the temperateness of the air was no argument of antiquity; 'because Nature, when she first distributed to different countries degrees of heat and cold, immediately produced in them animals fitted to endure the several climates, and generated also numerous sorts of trees and herbs, happily varied according to the condition of the places in which they grew; and that, as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> have a sharper air than the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, so are their bodies and constitutions in proportion more hardy. But that if the world, which is now distinguished into parts of a different nature, was once uniform throughout; whether a deluge of waters originally kept the earth buried under it; or whether fire, which also produced the world, had possession of all the parts of it, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, under either supposition as to the primordial state of things, had the advantage as to origin. For if fire was at first predominant over all things, and, being gradually extinguished, gave place to the earth, no part of it would be sooner separated from the fire, by the severity of winter cold, than the northern, since even now no part is more frozen with cold; but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and all the east must have been the latest to cool, as being now burnt up with the parching heat of the sun. But if originally all the earth were sunk under water, assuredly the highest parts would be first uncovered when the waters decreased, and the water must have remained longest in the lowest grounds; while the sooner any portion of the earth was dry, the sooner it must have begun to produce animals; but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> was so much higher than all other countries, that all the rivers which rise in it run down into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/460370WMai class=place long=37 lat=46>Maeotis</a>, and then into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=demonym long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptian</a> seas; whereas <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, (which, though it had been fenced by the care and expense of so many princes and generations, and furnished with such strong mounds against the violence of the encroaching waters, and though it had been intersected also by so many canals, the waters being kept out by the one, and retained by the other, was yet uninhabitable, unless the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a> were excluded,) could not be thought to have been the most anciently peopled; being a land, which, whether from the accessions of soil collected by its kings, or those from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, bringing mud with it, must appear to have been the most recently formed of all lands.'

It extends to a vast distance, both in length and breadth. The people have no landmarks, for they neither cultivate the soil, nor have they any house, dwelling, or settled place of abode, but are always engaged in feeding herds and flocks, and wandering through uncultivated deserts. They carry their wives and children with them in waggons, which, as they are covered with hides against the rain and cold, they use instead of houses. <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> is observed among them, more from the temper of the people, than from the influence of laws. No crime in their opinion is more heinous than theft; for, among people that keep their flocks and herds without fence or shelter in the woods, what would be safe, if stealing were permitted? Gold and silver they despise, as much as other men covet them. They live on milk and honey. The use of wool and clothes is unknown among them, although they are pinched by perpetual cold; they wear, however, the skins of wild animals, great and small. Such abstemiousness has caused justice to be observed among them, as they covet nothing belonging to their neighbours; for it is only where riches are of use, that the desire of them prevails. And would that other men had like temperance, and like freedom from desire for the goods of others! There would then assuredly be fewer wars in all ages and countries, and the sword would not destroy more than the natural course of destiny. And it appears extremely wonderful, that nature should grant that to them which the Greeks cannot attain by long instruction from their wise men and the precepts of their philosophers; and that cultivated morals should have the disadvantage in a comparison with those of unpolished barbarians. So much better effect has the ignorance of vice in the one people than the knowledge of virtue in the other. </p>                        </div>

Here, making it their practice for several years to rob their neighbours, they were at last, by a combination of the surrounding people, cut to pieces in an ambuscade. Their wives, when they found that to exile was added the loss of their husbands, took arms themselves, and maintained their position, repelling the attacks of their enemies at first, and afterwards assailing them in return. They relinquished all thoughts of marrying with their neighbours, saying that it would be slavery, not matrimony. Venturing to set an example unimitated through all generations, they established their government without the aid of men, and soon maintained their power in defiance of them. And that none of their females might seem more fortunate than others, they put to death all the men who had remained at home. They also took revenge for their husbands that were killed in war, by a great slaughter of their neighbours. <br />Having thus secured peace by means of their arms, they proceeded, in order that their race might not fail, to form connexions with the men of the adjacent nations. If any male children were born, they put them to death. The girls they bred up to the same mode of life with themselves, not consigning them to idleness, or working in wool, but training them to arms, the management of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and hunting; burning their right breasts in infancy, that their use of the bow might not be obstructed by them; and hence they were called <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>. They had two queens, <a href=/people/7930 target=_blank>Marpesia</a> and Lampedo, who, dividing their forces into two bodies (after they were grown famous for their power), conducted their wars, and defended their borders separately and by turns. And that a reason for their success might not be wanting, they spread a report that they were the daughters of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>. <br />After subduing the greater part of Europe, they possessed themselves also of some cities in Asia. Having then founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> and several other towns there, they sent a detachment of their army home, laden with a vast quantity of spoil. The rest, who remained to secure their power in Asia, were cut to pieces, together with their queen <a href=/people/7930 target=_blank>Marpesia</a>, by a combination of the barbarous tribes. <a href=/people/5850 target=_blank>Orithya</a>, the daughter oi <a href=/people/7930 target=_blank>Marpesia</a>, succeeded to the government in her room, and has attracted extraordinary admiration, not only for her eminent skill in war, but for having preserved her virginity to the end of her life. So much was added by her valour and conduct to the fame and glory of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, that the king, for whom <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> was bound to perform twelve labours, ordered him, as if it were a thing impossible, to bring him the arms of the queen of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, accordingly, having proceeded thither with nine ships of war, the principal young men of Greece accompanying him, attacked the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a> unawares. Two sisters at this time held the government, <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a> and <a href=/people/5850 target=_blank>Orithya</a>; but <a href=/people/5850 target=_blank>Orithya</a> was engaged in a war abroad. When <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, therefore, landed on the coast of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, there was but a small number of them there with their queen <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>, free from all apprehension of hostilities. Hence it happened that a few only, roused by the sudden alarm, took up arms, and these afforded an easy conquest to the enemy. Many were slain, and many taken prisoners; among the latter were two sisters of <a href=/people/792 target=_blank>Antiope</a>, Menalippe being taken by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, and <a href=/people/1735 target=_blank>Hippolyte</a> by <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>. <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, having received his prisoner as his share of the spoil, took her to wife, and had by her his son <a href=/people/560 target=_blank>Hippolytus</a>. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, after his victory, restored his captive Menalippe to her sister, receiving the arms of the queen as a recompense; and having thus executed what was imposed on him, he returned to the king. <br />But <a href=/people/5850 target=_blank>Orithya</a>, when she found that war had been made upon her sister, and that the assailant was a chief of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, exhorted her followers to revenge the affront, saying that the 'coast of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=place long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, and Asia, had been conquered in vain, if they were still exposed, not merely to the wars, but to the marauding invasions, of the Greeks.'

For their wives, weary of waiting so long for their husbands, and thinking that they were not detained by war, but had perished in the field, married their slaves that had been left at home to take care of the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>; who, taking up arms, repelled their masters, returning with victory, from the borders of their country, as if they had been strangers. Success against them being uncertain, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> were advised to change their method of attack, remembering that they were not to fight with soldiers, but with slaves, who were to be conquered, not by means of arms, but of magisterial authority; that whips, not weapons, were to be used in the field; and that, swords being laid aside, rods and scourges, and other instruments of terror to slaves, were to be provided. This suggestion being approved, and all being equipped as was prescribed, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a>, as soon as they drew near the enemy, held out scourges towards them unexpectedly, and struck them such terror, that they conquered with the dread of stripes those whom they could not conquer with the sword, and who took to flight, not as defeated enemies, but as fugitive slaves. As many as could be taken, paid the penalty for their rebellion on the cross. The women too, conscious of their ill conduct, put an end to their lives partly by the sword and partly by hanging. <br />After this occurrence, there was peace among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> till the time of king Jancyrus, on whom <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a>, as was said above, made war, because he could not obtain his daughter in marriage. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, having entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a> with seven hundred thousand armed men, and the enemy allowing him no opportunity of fighting, dreading lest, if the bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/442277WIst class=place long=27.742 lat=44.206>Ister</a> were broken down, his retreat should be cut off, hurried back in alarm, with the loss of eighty thousand men; which loss, however, out of so vast a, number, was scarcely accounted a disaster. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> afterwards subdued Asia and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> in a fight at sea.

It was not a concourse of foreigners, or a rabble of people collected from different parts, that raised their city, but men who were born on the same ground which they inhabit; and the country which is their place of abode, was also their birthplace. It was they who first taught the art of working in wool, and the use of oil and wine. They also showed men, who had previously fed on acorns, how to plough and <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a>. Literature and eloquence, it is certain, and the state of civil discipline which we enjoy, had <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> as their temple. Before <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>'s time, they had a king named <a href=/people/447 target=_blank>Cecrops</a>, whom, as all antiquity is full of fables, they represented to have been of both sexes, because he was the first to join male and female in marriage. To him succeeded <a href=/people/4340 target=_blank>Cranaus</a>, whose daughter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Atthis</a> gave name to the country. After him reigned <a href=/people/1385 target=_blank>Amphictyon</a>, who first consecrated the city to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, and gave it the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. In his days, a deluge swept away the greater part of the inhabitants of Greece. Those only escaped, whom a refuge on the mountains protected, or who went off in ships to <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=person long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, by whom, from this circumstance, the human race is said to have been restored. The crown then descended, in the course of succession, to <a href=/people/298 target=_blank>Erechtheus</a>, in whose reign the sowing of corn was commenced by <a href=/people/702 target=_blank>Triptolemus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235PEle class=place long=23.5415 lat=38.0441>Eleusis</a>; in commemoration of which benefit the nights sacred to the mysteries of <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a> were appointed. <a href=/people/399 target=_blank>Aegeus</a> also, the father of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, was king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, from whom <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> divorcing herself, on account of the adult age of her step-son, returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a> with her son <a href=/people/1685 target=_blank>Medus</a>, whom she had had by <a href=/people/399 target=_blank>Aegeus</a>.

At that time the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> was <a href=/people/680 target=_blank>Codrus</a>, who, learning the answer of the god and the directions of the enemy,-laid aside his royal dress, and entered the camp of the enemy in rags, with a bundle of sticks on his back. Here, among a crowd of people that stood in his way, he was killed by a soldier whom he had purposely wounded with a pruning knife. His body being recognized as that of the king, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor class=ethnic long=22.4 lat=38.7>Dorians</a> went off without coming to battle; and thus the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, through the bravery of a prince who submitted to death for the safety of his country, were relieved from war. </p>                        </div>

The government of the state was placed in the hands of magistrates elected annually. At this period the people had no laws, for the wills of their princes had always been received instead of laws. <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, a man of eminent integrity, was in consequence chosen to found the state, as it were afresh, by the establishment of laws. This man acted with such judicious moderation between the commons and the senate (though whatever he proposed in favour of one class, seemed likely to displease the other), that he received equal thanks from both parties. Among many illustrious acts of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, the following is eminently worthy of record. A war had been carried on between the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>, concerning their respective claims to the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379235PSal class=place long=23.5408 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, almost to the utter destruction of both.

In a strange garb, like an insane person, he rushed forth into the public streets, where, having collected a crowd about him, he began, that he might the better conceal his design, to urge the people in verse (which he was unaccustomed to make), to do what was forbidden, and produced such an effect on the minds of all, that war was instantly decreed against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=ethnic long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megarians</a>; and the enemy being defeated, the island became subject to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. </p>                        </div>

Having undergone a voluntary scourging in his own house, he ran out, with his body lacerated, into the open street, and, having summoned an assembly of the people, showed them his wounds, complaining of the cruelty of the great men of the city, from whom he pretended to have received this treatment. Tears were joined to his words, and the credulous mob was easily inflamed be a calumnious speech, in which he affirmed that he had incurred the hatred of the senate by showing his love for the common people. He thus obtained a guard for the protection of his person, by the aid of which he got the sovereign power into his hands, and reigned thirty-three years. </p>                        </div>

But the contest was conducted in so brotherly a way, that neither did he who gained the cause show any unseemly triumph, nor did he who lost it express dissatisfaction; and, during the very time of the contention, they sent presents to one another, and gave such entertainments, as showed not only mutual confidence, but pleasure in each other's society. The judgment, too, was pronounced without witnesses, and heard without a murmur. So much more contentedly did brothers then share the greatest kingdoms, than they now divide the smallest estates! <br /><a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> then proceeded, during five years, with his preparations for the war against Greece, which his father had commenced. As soon as <a href=/people/475 target=_blank>Demaratus</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, who was then an exile at the court of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, understood his intentions, he, feeling more regard for his country, notwithstanding his banishment, than for the king in return for his favours, sent full intelligence of the matter to the magistrates of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a>, that they might not be surprised by an unexpected attack; writing the account on wooden tablets, and hiding the writing with wax spread over it; taking care, however, not merely that writing without a cover might not give proof against him, but that too fresh wax might not betray the contrivance. These tablets he committed to a trusty slave, who was ordered to deliver them into the hands of the authorities at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>. When they were received, the object of them was long a matter of inquiry, because the magistrates could see nothing written on them, and yet could not imagine that they were sent to no purpose; and they thought the matter must be momentous in proportion to its mysteriousness. While the men were still engaged in conjecture, the sister of king <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> surmised the writer's intention. The wax being accordingly scraped off. the account of the warlike preparations appeared. <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> had already armed seven hundred thousand men of his own kingdom, and three hundred thousand of his auxiliaries; so that there was some ground for the assertion that rivers were drunk up by his army, and that all Greece could scarcely contain it. He is also said to have had a fleet of twelve hundred ships. But for this vast army a general was wanting; for if you contemplate its king, you could not commend his capacity as a leader, however you might extol his wealth, of which there was such abundance in his realm, that, while rivers were drained by his forces, his treasury was still unexhausted. He was always seen foremost in flight, and hindmost in battle; he was a coward in danger, and when danger was away, a boaster; and, in fine, before he made trial of war, elated with confidence in his strength (as if he had been lord of nature itself), he levelled mountains, filled up valleys, covered some seas with bridges, and contracted others, for the convenience of navigation, into shorter channels. </p>                        </div>

On the fourth, it being told <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a> that the summit of the mountain was occupied by twenty thousand of the enemy, he exhorted the allies 'to retire, and reserve themselves to their country for better times;' saying, that 'he himself would try his fortune with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>; that he ought to care more for his country than for his life, and that others should be preserved for the defence of Greece.'

King <a href=/people/12466 target=_blank>Leonidas</a>, accordingly, when he proceeded to battle, had so fixed the resolution of his men, that they felt they must go to the field with minds prepared for death. He had posted himself in a narrow pass, too, that he might either conquer more gloriously with a few, or fall with less damage to his country. The allies being therefore sent away, he exhorted his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a> 'to remember that, however they struggled, they must expect to perish; to take care not to show more resolution to stay than to fight;' adding that, 'they must not wait till they were surrounded by the enemy, but when night afforded them opportunity, must surprise them in security and at their ease; as conquerors could die nowhere more honourably than in the camp of the foe.' There was no difficulty in stimulating men determined to die. They immediately seized their arms, and six hundred men rushed into the camp of five hundred thousand, making directly for the king's tent, and resolving either to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at least in his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army.

The contest was protracted from the beginning of the night through the greater part of the following day. At last, not conquered, but exhausted with conquering, they fell amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies. <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, having thus met with two defeats by land, resolved next to try his fortune by sea. </p>                        </div>

Being unable to find any opportunity of speaking with them, he caused placards to be fixed, and inscriptions to be written, on the rocks where they were to land, to the following effect; 'What madness possesses you, O <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>? What evil are you going to do? Do you intend to make war on those who were formerly your founders, and lately your avengers?

But pass over from your place of confinement to our camp; or, if this course is unsafe, withdraw when the battle begins; keep back your vessels with your oars, and retire from the engagement.' Before this encounter at sea, <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> had sent four thousand armed men to plunder the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SApo class=place long=22.5011 lat=38.48225>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, as if he had been at war, not with the Greeks only, but with the immortal gods; but the whole of this detachment was destroyed by a storm of rain and thunder, that he might be convinced how feeble human strength is against the powers of heaven. Afterwards he burnt <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383232PThe class=place long=23.1549 lat=38.2935>Thespiae</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382233PPla class=place long=23.2733 lat=38.2213>Plataeae</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, all abandoned by their inhabitants; venting his rage on the buildings by fire, since he could not destroy the people by the sword.

The counsel being approved, they committed their wives and children, with their most valuable property, to certain islands out of the way; while the men went in arms on board the ships. Other cities also followed the example of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>.

By this stratagem he induced the king to give the signal for battle. The Greeks, at the same time, taken by surprise by the enemy's attack, proceeded to oppose them with their united force. The king, meantime, remained on shore as a spectator of the combat, with part of the ships near him; while <a href=/people/855 target=_blank>Artemisia</a>, queen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal class=person long=27.4238 lat=37.0323>Halicarnassus</a>, who had come to the assistance of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, was fighting with the greatest gallantry among the foremost leaders; so that you might have seen womanish fear in a man, and manly boldness in a woman. While the result of the battle was still doubtful, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a>, according to the admonition of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>, began gradually to withdraw from the contest; and their desertion broke the courage of the rest.

But <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>, fearing that the enemy, if they were stopped, might take courage from despair, and open by their swords a passage not to he opened by other means, and observing that 'there were enemies enough left in Greece, and that the number ought not to be increased by preventing their escape,' but finding that he was unable to move his countrymen by his admonitions, despatched the same slave as before to <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, acquainting him of the intention of the Greeks to break down the bridge, and urging him to secure a passage by a speedy flight. <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, alarmed at the message, left his army to be conducted by his generals, and hurried away himself, with a few attendants, to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264PAby class=place long=26.4091 lat=40.1951>Abydos</a>; where, having found the bridge broken down by the winter storms, he crossed in the utmost trepidation in a fishing-boat.

Nor had the land-forces, which he had committed to his generals, a more fortunate retreat; for to their daily fatigue (and there is no rest to men in fear) was added the want of provisions. A famine of several days produced also a pestilential distemper; and so dire was the mortality, that the roads were filled with dead bodies; and birds and beasts of prey, allured by the attraction of food, followed close upon the army. </p>                        </div>

They chose <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> to be general of their army, and that of their allies, who, coveting, instead of the mere office of general, the entire sovereignty of Greece, treated with <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a> for a marriage with his daughter, as a reward for betraying his country, restoring him, at the same time, his prisoners, that the good feeling of the king might be secured by such an obligation. He wrote also to <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, 'to put to death whatever messengers he sent to him, lest the negotiation should be betrayed by their babbling.' But <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, the general of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and his associate in the command, by traversing the attempts of his colleague, and taking prudent precautions on the occasion, defeated his treasonable designs. Not long after, <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a> was brought to trial and condemned. <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, when he found that this perfidious scheme was discovered, made fresh preparations for war.

For he redeemed the body of his father (who had been thrown into prison on a charge of embezzling the public money, and had died there), taking his fetters on himself, that it might receive the rites of sepulture. Nor did he, in his conduct of the war, disappoint the opinion of those who chose him; for, not falling in merit below his father, he forced <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, defeated both by land and sea, to retreat in trepidation to his own dominions. </p>                        </div>

The forces of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> at home were at that time inconsiderable, as their fleet had been despatched into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, so that, engaging in battle by sea, they were quickly worsted.

But their hostile feelings did not allow of so long a period of repose. Hence, having broken the treaty before the fifteenth year was ended, they laid waste the territories of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> in violation of their obligations towards the gods and towards men. And lest they should seem to have desired to plunder rather than to fight, they challenged the enemy to the field. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, by the advice of their leader <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, deferred revenge for the spoliation of their lands to a fitter time of exacting it, thinking it needless to hazard a battle, when they could avenge themselves on the enemy without risk. Some days afterwards, accordingly, they embarked in their fleet, and, while the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> expected nothing of the kind, laid waste all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>, carrying off much more than they had lost; so that, in a comparison of their respective sufferings, the retaliation was much greater than the injury at first received. This expedition of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> was considered as greatly to his honour; but his disregard of his private property was far more honourable. The enemy, while they wasted the lands of others, had left his uninjured; hoping, by this means, either to bring danger on him by rendering him unpopular, or dishonour by making him suspected of treachery. But <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a>, foreseeing what would happen, had both foretold it to the people, and, to escape the effects of popular odium, had made over his lands to the state as a gift; and thus obtained the greatest honour from that by which his ruin had been intended.

Nevertheless they did not cease from fierce attacks on one another, by sea or land, with various success. At last, exhausted with disasters on both sides, they made peace for fifty years, which however they maintained only for six; for they broke the treaty which they had concluded on their own account, under pretence of assisting their allies; as if they were less guilty of perjury by aiding their dependants, than by engaging in open hostilities themselves. <br />The war was in consequence transferred into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; but before I relate its progress, it is proper to give some account of the situation of that island. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0167.stoa001:4.1'><b>&sect; 4.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is said that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> was formerly joined to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> by a narrow pass, and was torn off, as it were, from the larger body, by the violence of the upper sea, which impels itself in that direction with the whole force of its waters. The soil itself, too, is light and frangible, and so perforated with caverns and passages, that it is almost everywhere open to blasts of wind; and the very matter of it is naturally adapted for generating and nourishing fire, as it is said to be impregnated with sulphur and bitumen, a circumstance which is the cause that when air contends with fire in the subterraneous parts, the earth frequently, and in several places, sends forth flame, or vapour, or smoke. Hence it is that the fire of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> has lasted through so many ages. And when a strong wind passes in through the openings of the cavities, heaps of sand are cast up. <br />The promontory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> on the side nearest to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, is called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>, because things broken off are designated by that term in Greek. Nor is it strange that antiquity should have been full of fables concerning these parts, in which so many extraordinary things are found together. The sea, in the first place, is nowhere so impetuous, pouring on with a current not only rapid but furious, not only frightful to those who feel its effects, but to those who view it from a distance. So fierce is the conflict of the waves as they meet, that you may see some of them, put to flight as it were, sink down into the depths, and others, as if victorious, rising up to the skies. Sometimes, in one part, you may hear the roaring of the sea as it boils up; and again, in another part, the groaning of it as it sinks into a whirlpool. Next are to be observed the adjacent and everlasting fires of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> and the Aeolian islands, which burn as if their heat were nourished by the sea itself; nor indeed could such a quantity of fire have endured in such narrow bounds for so many ages unless it were supported by nourishment from the water. Hence fables produced <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383157LSky class=place long=15.715 lat=38.255>Scylla</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382156WCha class=place long=15.606 lat=38.248>Charybdis</a>; hence barkings were thought to have been heard; hence the appearances of monsters gained credit, as the sailors, frightened at the vast whirlpools of the subsiding waters, imagined that the waves, which the vortex of the absorbent gulf clashes together, actually barked. The same cause makes the fires of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377150LAit class=place long=15.001 lat=37.748>Aetna</a> perpetual; for the shock of the waters forces into the depths a portion of air hurried along with it, and then keeps it confined till, being diffused through the pores of the earth, it kindles the matter which nourishes the fire. <br />In addition, the proximity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> is to be noticed, with the heights of their respective promontories, which are so similar, that, whatever wonder they raise in us in the present day, they excited proportionate terror in the ancients, who believed that whole ships were intercepted and destroyed by the promontories closing together and opening. Nor was this invented by the ancients to gratify the hearer with a fabulous wonder, but occasioned by the terror and consternation of those who passed by those parts; for such is the appearance of the coasts to any one beholding them from a distance, that you would take the passage between them for a bay in the sea, and not a strait; and, as you draw nearer, you would think that the promontories, which were before united, part asunder and separate. </p>                        </div>

Such power indeed, strange to say, was there in that one man, that he was the cause of a great state being subverted and again re-established; victory removed herself to the side on which he stood; and a wonderful change of fortune always attended him.

This transaction <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazus</a> made matter of accusation to their common sovereign, acquainting him that '<a href=/people/163 target=_blank>Tissaphernes</a> had not taken arms to repel the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> on their invasion of Asia, but had maintained them at the king's charge, and bargained with them as to what they should put off doing in the war, and what they should carry into execution, as if every loss did not affect the interest of the one empire in general,' adding that 'it was disgraceful that war should not he decided by the sword, but bought off, and that the enemy should be induced to retire, not by arms, but by money.' When by such charges he had irritated the king against <a href=/people/163 target=_blank>Tissaphernes</a>, he advised him to appoint in his place, as commander by sea, <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, who, having left his country on account of his ill success, was living in exile in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>; 'for though the power of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>,' he said, 'was reduced, their experience at sea was still left them, and that, were a choice to be made from them all, no one could be preferred to <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>.' <a href=/people/172 target=_blank>Pharnabazus</a> was accordingly furnished with five hundred talents and directed to set <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a> over the fleet. </p>                        </div>

At last they decided that 'it was better for the king to halt in his gait than for the kingdom to halt in its power;' and when they afterwards sent <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a>, with a large army into Asia, I cannot easily tell what other two generals were ever so well matched; for the age, valour, conduct, and wisdom of both were nearly equal, as was also the fame of their achievements; and fortune, who had given them equal qualifications, had kept the one from being conquered by the other. Great preparations for war, therefore, were made by both, and great deeds were performed. But a mutiny among his soldiers arose to trouble <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, in consequence of the king's officers making it a practice to defraud them of their pay; and they demanded their arrears the more obstinately, as they anticipated that service under so great a general would be very severe. <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>, having long importuned the king by letters to no purpose, went at last to him in person, but was debarred from any interview or conference with him, because he would not do him homage after the manner of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>. He, however, treated with him through his ministers, and complained that 'the wars of the richest king in the world ended in nothing through want of pay; and that he who had an army equal to that of the enemy, was defeated by means of money in which he was their superior, and found inferior to them in that article of power in which he had far the advantage of them.' He also desired that one paymaster might be appointed for his troops, as it was evidently detrimental to commit that office to several. Money for his soldiers was then given him, and he returned to the fleet. Nor did he delay to enter on action; he executed many undertakings with resolution, many with success; he laid waste the enemy's country, stormed their towns, and bore down everything before him like a hurricane. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedaemonians</a> were so alarmed at his progress, that they resolved on recalling <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> from Asia to the support of his country. </p>                        </div>

In this battle two generals of the enemy were killed, when, on intelligence being received that <a href=/people/51 target=_blank>Agesilaus</a> was approaching, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> retreated.

When this was known, fear fell upon one side from, deep concern, and amaze on the other from excess of joy; and both parties, as if by mutual agreement, retired from the field. </p>                        </div>

They neither carried on any memorable war before he became their leader, nor were they afterwards remarkable for their successes, but for their defeats; so that it is certain that with him the glory of his country both rose and fell. Whether he was more estimable as a man or a general is undecided; for he never sought power for himself, but for his country, and was so far from coveting money, that he did not leave sufficient to pay for his funeral. Nor was he more desirous of distinction than of wealth; for all the appointments that he held were conferred on him against his will, and he filled his posts in such a manner that he seemed to add lustre to his honours rather than to receive it from them. His application to learning, and his knowledge of philosophy, were such, that it seemed wonderful how a man bred up in literature could have so excellent a knowledge of war. The manner of his death, too, was not at variance with his course of life; for when he was carried back half dead into the camp, and had recovered his breath and voice, he asked only this question of those that stood about him, 'whether the enemy had taken his shield from him when he fell?' Hearing that it was saved, he kissed it, when it was brought to him, as the sharer of his toils and glory. He afterwards inquired which side had gained the victory, and hearing that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=ethnic long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebans</a> had got it, observed, 'It is well,' and so, as it were congratulating his country, expired. </p>                        </div>

At the commencement of his reign, when, on the one hand, the murder of his brother, so atrociously put to death, and the dread of treachery; on the other, a multitude of enemies, and the poverty of his kingdom, exhausted by a series of wars, bore hard upon the young king's immature age, thinking it proper to make distinct arrangements as to the wars, which, as if by a common conspiracy to crush <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, rose around him from different nations and several quarters at the same time, to all of which he could not at once make resistance, he put an end to some by offers of peace, and bought off others, but attacked such of his enemies as seemed easiest to be subdued, that, by a victory over them, he might confirm the wavering minds of his soldiers, and alter any feelings of contempt with which his adversaries might regard him. His first conflict was with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, whom he surprised by a stratagem, but, though he might have put them all to the sword, he yet, from dread of a more formidable war, allowed them to depart uninjured and without ransom.

When he was twenty years of age, accordingly, he took the kingdom from <a href=/people/4434 target=_blank>Arrybas</a>, and gave it to the youth, acting a base part towards both, for he disregarded the claims of consanguinity in him from whom he took the kingdom, and corrupted him to whom he gave it before he made him a king. </p>                        </div>

With these provocations to resentment, both of them are thought to have encouraged <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, when complaining of his insults being left unpunished, to so atrocious a deed. <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a>, it is certain, had <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> prepared for the escape of the assassin; and, when she heard that the king was dead, hastening to the funeral under the appearance of respect, she put a crown of gold, the same night that she arrived, on the head of <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, as he was hanging on a cross; an act which no one but she would have dared to do, as long as the son of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was alive. A few days after, she burnt the body of the assassin, when it had been taken down, upon the remains of her husband, and made him a tomb in the same place; she also provided that yearly sacrifices should beper-formed to his manes, possessing the people with a superstitious notion for the purpose. Next she forced <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a>, for whose sake she had been divorced from <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, to hang herself, having first killed her daughter in her lap, and enjoyed the sight of her suffering this vengeance, to which she had hastened by procuring the death of her husband.

He had, by a dancing girl of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396224PLar class=person long=22.421 lat=39.6349>Larissa</a>, a son named <a href=/people/1217 target=_blank>Aridaeus</a>, who reigned after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. He had also many others by several wives, as is not unusual with princes, some of whom died a natural death, and others by the sword. As a king, he was more inclined to display in war, than in entertainments; and his greatest riches were means for military operations. He was better at getting wealth than keeping it, and, in consequence, was always poor amidst his daily spoliations. Clemency and perfidy were equally valued by him; and no road to victory was, in his opinion, dishonourable. He was equally pleasing and treacherous in his address, promising more than he could perform, He was well qualified either for serious conversation or for jesting. He maintained friendships more with a view to interest than good faith. It was a common practice with him to pretend kindness where he hated, and to counterfeit dislike where he loved; to sow dissension among friends, and try to gain favour from both sides. With such a disposition, his eloquence was very great, his language full of point and studied effect; so that neither did his facility fall short of his art, nor his invention of his facility, nor his art of his invention. <br />To <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> succeeded his son <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, a prince greater than his father, both in his virtues and his vices. Each of the two had a different mode of conquering; the one prosecuted his wars with open force, the other with subtlety; the one delighted in deceiving his enemies, the other in boldly repulsing them. The one was more prudent in council, the other more noble in feeling. The father would dissemble his resentment and often:subdue it; when the son was provoked, there was neither delay nor bounds to his vengeance. They were both too fond of wine, but the ill effects of their intoxication were totally different; the father would rush from a banquet to face the enemy, cope with him, and rashly expose himself to dangers; the son vented his rage, not upon his enemies, but his friends. A battle often sent away <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> wounded; <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> often left a banquet stained with the blood of his companions. The one wished to reign with his friends, the other to reign over them. The one preferred to be loved, the other to be feared. To literature both gave equal attention. The father had more cunning, the son more honour. <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> was more staid in his words, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in his actions. The son felt readier and nobler impulses to spare the conquered; the father showed no mercy even to his allies. The father was more inclined to frugality, the son to luxury. By the same course by which the father laid the foundations of the empire of the world, the son consummated the glory of conquering the whole world. </p>                        </div>

He endeavoured to work upon the king, too, from his superstitious regard for <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, who had been born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>, and from whom the family of the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aeacidae</a> was descended, and from the reflection that the youth of his father <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> had; been spent at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a>; and he conjured him 'to spare a city which adored some of his ancestors, who had been born in it, as gods, and saw others who had been brought up in it, princes of the highest dignity.' But resentment was more powerful than entreaty. The city was in consequence demolished, the lands divided among the conquerors, and the prisoners publicly sold, their price being settled not for the profit of those who bought them, but according to the hatred of their enemies.

Having then assembled his troops, he put them on shipboard, where, excited with incredible animation at the sight of Asia, he erected altars to the twelve gods to offer prayers for success in the war. He divided all his private property, which he had in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> and the rest of Europe, among his friends, saying, 'that for himself Asia was sufficient.'

His army consisted of thirty-two thousand infantry, and four thousand five hundred cavalry, with a hundred and eighty-two ships. Whether, with this small force, it is more wonderful that he conquered the world, or that he dared to attempt its conquest, is difficult to determine. When he selected his troops for so hazardous a warfare, he did not choose robust young men, or men in the flower of their age, but veterans, most of whom had even passed their term of service, and who had fought under his father and his uncles; so that he might be thought to have chosen, not soldiers, but masters in war. No one was made an officer who was not sixty years of age; so that he who saw the captains assembled at head-quarters, would have declared that he saw the senate of some ancient republic. None, on the field of battle, thought of flight, but every one of victory; none trusted in his feet, but every one in his arms. <br />King <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, on the other hand, from confidence in his strength, abstained from all artifice in his operations; observing that 'clandestine measures were fit only for a stolen victory;' he did not attempt to repel the enemy from his frontiers, but admitted them into the heart of his kingdom, thinking it more honourable to drive war out of his kingdom than not to give it entrance. The first engagement, in consequence, was fought on the plains of <a href=/people/1436 target=_blank>Adrastia</a>. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> army consisted of six hundred thousand men, who were conquered not less by the valour of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> than by the conduct of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and took to flight.

After this victory the greater part of Asia came over to his side. He had also several encounters with <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>'s lieutenants, whom he conquered, not so much by his arms, as by the terror of his name. </p>                        </div>

Fearing, therefore, that, if he were put to death, some disturbance might arise in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, he only kept him in prison. <br />He soon after marched to a city called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397320UGor class=place long=31.9966 lat=39.6527>Gordium</a>, which is situated between the Greater and Lesser <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a>, and which he earnestly desired to take, not so much for the sake of plunder, as because he had heard that in that city, in the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, was deposited the yoke of <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a>'s car; the knot of which, if any one should loose, the oracles of old had predicted that he should rule all Asia. The cause and origin of the matter was as follows. When <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a> was ploughing in these parts, with <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> that he had hired, birds of every kind began to fly about him. Going to consult the augurs of the next town on the occurrence, he met at the gate a virgin of remarkable beauty, and asked her 'which of the augurs he had best consult.' When she, having heard his reason for consulting them, and knowing something of the art from the instruction of her parents, replied, that 'a kingdom was portended to him,' and offered to become his wife and the sharer of his expectations. So fair a match seemed the chief felicity of a throne. After his marriage a civil war arose among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>; and when they consulted the oracles how their discord, might be terminated, the oracles replied that 'a king was required to settle their disputes.' Inquiring a second time as to the person of the king, they were directed to regard him as their king whom they should first observe, on their return, going to the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> on a car. The person who presented himself to them was <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a>, and they at once saluted him king. He dedicated the car, in which he was riding when the throne was offered him, 'to kingly majesty,' and it was placed in the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. After him reigned his son <a href=/people/410 target=_blank>Midas</a>, who, having been instructed by <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a> in sacred rites, filled all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=place long=31 lat=40>Phrygia</a> with ceremonies of religion, by which he was better protected, during his whole life, than by arms. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, having taken the city, and gone to the temple of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, requested to see the yoke of <a href=/people/1944 target=_blank>Gordius</a>'s car, and, when it was shown him, not being able to find the ends of the cords, which were hidden within the knots, he put a forced interpretation on the oracle, and cut the cords with his sword; and thus, when the involutions were opened out, discovered the ends concealed in them. </p>                        </div>

One of his physicians, named <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, was the only person that promised a cure; but a letter from <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>, which arrived the day before from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, rendered him an object of suspicion; for <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>, knowing nothing of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s illness, had written to caution him against trusting <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>, as he had been bribed by <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> with a large sum of money. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, however, thought it better to trust the doubtful faith of the physician, than to perish of certain disease.

His hopes, therefore, prevailing over his apprehensions, and thinking it more hazardous to defer the contest, lest dismay should fall upon his men, he rode round among his troops, and addressed those of each nation in an appropriate speech.

He was answered that 'his father could neither be assassinated, nor could die; but that vengeance for <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s death had been fully exacted.' On putting a third question, he was told that 'success in all his wars, and dominion over the world, was granted him.' A response was also given by the oracle to his attendants, that 'they should reverence <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> as a god, and not as a king.'

All hopes of peace being thus lost, <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> resumed hostilities, and proceeded to meet <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> with four hundred thousand infantry and a hundred thousand cavalry. On his march he was informed that 'his wife had died of a miscarriage, and that <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had mourned for her death, and attended her funeral; acting, in that respect, not from love, but merely from kindness of feeling; as <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>'s wife had been visited by him but once, though he had often gone to console his mother and her little daughters.' <br /><a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> now considered himself indeed overcome, since, after losing so many battles, he was surpassed by his enemy even in kindnesses, and declared that it vas a consolation to him since he could not conquer, to be conquered by such an enemy.

Nothing but the presence of the king being wanting, in order to commence the engagement, he was awakened, though with difficulty, by <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>, and as those about him asked the reason of his sleeping in the midst of danger, when he was sparing of sleep even in time of security, he answered that 'he had been relieved from great concern, and that his repose was occasioned by sudden freedom from apprehension, since he should now engage with the forces of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in a body; whereas he had dreaded, if the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a> should divide their army, that the war would be greatly protracted.'

He bade them remember only that 'they were now fighting for the third time with the same adversaries; and not to imagine that they had been rendered braver by defeat, as they would bring into the field with them the sad recollection of former disasters, and of the blood shed in the two previous engagements;' adding, that '<a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had the greater number of human beings, but he himself the greater number of men.' He admonished them 'to despise an army glittering with gold and silver, in which they would find more spoil than danger, since victory was to be gained, not by splendour of arms, but by the power of the sword.' </p>                        </div>

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, on the other hand, were desirous to die rather than be conquered. Seldom has there been so much blood shed in a battle. <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, when he saw his army repulsed, wished himself to die, but was compelled by his officers to flee. Some advising that the bridge over the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349WKyd class=place long=34.92 lat=36.9191>Cydnus</a> should be broken down, in order to stop the advance of the enemy, he said that 'he would not provide for his safety in such a way as to expose so many thousands of his followers to the foe; and that the road which was open to himself, ought also to be open to others.' <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, meanwhile, made the most hazardous efforts; where he saw the enemy thickest, and fighting most desperately, there he always threw himself, desiring that the peril should be his, and not his soldiers'.

But while he was allowing the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> time to rest, one of the soldiers, going to a neighbouring spring, found <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> in the vehicle, wounded in several places, but still alive. One of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> captives being brought forward, the dying prince, knowing from his voice that he was his countryman, said that 'he had at least this comfort in his present sufferings, that he should speak to one who could understand him, and that he should not utter his last words in vain.' He then desired that the following message should be given to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>: that 'he died without having done him any acts of kindness, but a debtor to him for the greatest, since he had found his feelings towards his mother and children to be those of a prince, not of a foe; that he had been more happy in his enemy than in his relations, for by his enemy life had been granted to his mother and children, but taken from himself by his relatives, to whom he had given both life and kingdoms; and that such a requital must therefore be made them as his conqueror should please. For himself, that he made the only return to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> which he could at the point of death, by praying to the gods above and below, and the powers that protected kings, that the empire of the world might fall to his lot. That he desired the favour of a decent rather than a magnificent funeral; and, as to avenging his death, it was not his cause alone that was concerned, but precedent, and the common cause of all kings, which it would be both dishonourable and dangerous for him to neglect; since, in regard to vengeance, the interests of justice were affected, and, in regard to precedent, those of the general safety. To this effect he gave him his right hand, as the only pledge of a king's faith to be conveyed to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>.' Then, stretching out his hand, he expired. <br />When this intelligence was communicated to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he went to see the body of the dead monarch, and contemplated with tears a death so unsuitable to his dignity. He also directed his corpse to he buried as that of a king, and his relics to be conveyed to the sepulchres of his ancestors. </p>                        </div>

Having, by this speech, revived the spirits of his soldiers for new exertions, he subdued <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370546RHyr class=place long=54.6 lat=37>Hyrcania</a> and the Mardians. Here Thalestris, or Minithya, queen of the <a href=/people/154 target=_blank>Amazons</a>, came to meet him, having travelled for twenty-five days, with three hundred women in her train, and through extremely populous nations, in order to have issue by him. Her appearance and arrival was a cause of astonishment to all, both from her dress, which was an unusual one for women, and from the object of her visit.

But that he might not appear to be the only person who yielded to the vices of those whom he had conquered in the field, he permitted his soldiers also, if they had formed a connexion with any of the female captives, to marry them; thinking that they would feel less desire to return to their country, when they had some appearance of a house and home in the camp, and that the fatigues of war would be relieved by the agreeable society of their wives.

This custom was also continued under <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s successors.

If the fathers of any of them were killed, the orphans notwithstanding received their father's pay; and their childhood was a sort of military service in various expeditions.

For this offence, <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a>, an old man, next to the king in rank, and his son <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, were put to death; an examination by torture having been previously held on both of them.

He exhorted his soldiers to write to their relatives, as they would now have fewer opportunities on account of the scene of warfare being further from home. The packets of letters, as they were given in, he commanded to be privately brought to him, and having learned from them what every one thought of him, he put all those, who had given unfavourable opinions of his conduct, into one regiment, with an intention either to destroy them, or to distribute them in colonies in the most distant parts of the earth. <br />He then subdued the Drancae, the Evergetae, the Parymae, the Parapammeni, the Adaspii, and other nations that dwelt at the foot of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433424LCau class=place long=42.45 lat=43.351>Caucasus</a>. <br />In the meantime <a href=/people/980 target=_blank>Bessus</a>, one of the former friends of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, who had not only betrayed his sovereign, but put him to death, was brought to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> in chains, who, that he might be punished for his treachery, delivered him to the brother of <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> to be tortured, considering not so much that <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> had been his enemy, as that he had been the friend of the man by whom he had been lulled. <br />That he might leave his name to these parts, he founded the city of Alexandria on the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/473393WTan class=place long=39.336 lat=47.268>Tanais</a>, completing a wall six miles in circuit in seventeen days, and transplanting into it the inhabitants of three cities that had been built by <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>.

Exulting at the murder, too, he scoffed at the dead man for his defence of <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a>, and his commendation of his mode of warfare. But when his mind, satiated with the bloodshed, grew calm, and reflection took the place of passion, he began, as he contemplated at one time the character of the dead, and at another the occasion of his death, to feel the deepest sorrow for the deed; grieving that he had listened to his father's praises with more anger than he ought to have listened to insults on his memory, and that an old and blameless friend had been slain by him at a feast and carousal. Driven, therefore, to repentance, with the same vehemence with which he had before been impelled to resentment, he determined to die. Bursting into tears, he embraced the dead man, laid his hand on his wounds, and confessed his madness to him as if he could hear; then, snatching up a weapon, he pointed it against his breast, and would have committed suicide, had not his friends interposed. His resolution to die continued even for several days after; for to his other causes of sorrow was added the remembrance of his nurse, the sister of <a href=/people/1153 target=_blank>Clitus</a>, on whose account, though she was far away, he was greatly ashamed of his conduct, lamenting that so base a return should be made her for rearing him; and that, in the maturity of life and conquest, he should have requited her, in whose arms he had spent his infancy, with bloodshed instead of kindness. He reflected, too, what remarks and odium he must have occasioned, as well in his own army as among the conquered nations; what fear and dislike of himself among his other friends; and how dismal and sad he had rendered his entertainment, appearing not less to be dreaded at a feast than when armed in the field of battle. <a href=/people/1334 target=_blank>Parmenio</a> and <a href=/people/591 target=_blank>Philotas</a>, his cousin <a href=/people/246 target=_blank>Amyntas</a>, his murdered stepmother and brothers, with <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, <a href=/people/904 target=_blank>Eurylochus</a>, <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>, and other slaughtered nobles of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, presented themselves to his imagination. He in consequence persisted in abstaining from food for four days, until he was drawn from his purpose by the prayers of the whole army, who conjured him 'not to lament the death of one, so far as to ruin them all; since, after bringing them into the remotest part of the barbarians' country, he would leave them amidst hostile nations exasperated by war.' The entreaties of <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> the philosopher had great effect upon him, a man who was intimate with him from having been his fellow-student under <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, and who had been subsequently sent for, by the king himself, to record his acts for the perusal of posterity. </p>                        </div>

He then led his army to view the sacred mountain, which was clad with the adornments of nature, the vine and ivy, as beautifully as if it had been tilled by art, and decked by the labour of the cultivator. But the troops, as they approached the hill, were impelled, by a sudden commotion in their minds, to utter devout cries to the god, and ran frantically up and down, to the amazement of the king, but without suffering any harm; whence he might understand that, by sparing the town, he had not so much secured its safety, as that of his own army. <br />He next proceeded to the Daedalian mountains, and the dominions of Queen <a href=/people/9153 target=_blank>Cleophis</a>; who, after surrendering to <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, recovered her throne from him by admitting him to her bed; saving by her charms what she had been unable to secure by her valour.

Coming to battle with him, accordingly, he directed his soldiers to attack the rest of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, but desired that their king should be reserved as an antagonist for himself. Nor did <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> decline the contest; but his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> being wounded in the first shock, he fell headlong to the ground, and was saved by his guards gathering round him. <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a>, covered with a number of wounds, was made prisoner, and was so grieved at being defeated, that when his life was granted him by the enemy, he would neither take food nor suffer his wounds to be dressed, and was scarcely at last prevailed upon to consent to live. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, from respect to his valour, sent him back in safety to his kingdom. Here he founded two cities, one called <a href=/people/1952 target=_blank>Nicaea</a>, and the other, from the name of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, <a href=/people/4904 target=_blank>Bucephale</a>. <br />He then overthrew the Adrestae, the Gesteani, the Presidae, and the <a href=/people/3845 target=_blank>Gangaridae</a>, with great slaughter among their troops. When he had reached the Cuphites, where the enemy awaited him with two thousand cavalry, the whole army, wearied not less with the number of their victories than with their toils in the field, besought him with tears that 'he would at length make an end of war, and think on his country and his return; considering the years of his soldiers, whose remainder of life would scarcely suffice for their journey home.' One pointed to his hoary hairs, another to his wounds, another to his body worn out with an age, another to his person disfigured with scars, saying 'that they were the only men who had endured unintermitted service under two kings, <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> and <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>;' and conjuring him in conclusion that 'he should restore their remains at least to the sepulchres of their fathers, since they failed not in zeal but in age; and that, if he would not spare his soldiers, he should yet spare himself, and not wear out his good fortune by pressing it too far.' Moved with these reasonable supplications, he ordered a camp to be formed, as if to mark the termination of his conquests, of greater size than usual, by the works of which the enemy might be astonished, and an admiration of himself be left to posterity. No task did the soldiers execute with more alacrity. After great slaughter of the enemy, they returned to this camp with mutual congratulations. </p>                        </div>

Gaining the victory in a battle, he led his army against their city; and supposing, as he looked from the wall, which he had been the first to mount, that the place was destitute of defenders, he leaped down into the area of the city without a single attendant. The enemy, seeing him alone, gathered round upon him with a shout, to try if by taking one life they could put an end to war in the world, and exact vengeance for the defeats of so many nations. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> withstood them with equal spirit, fighting alone against thousands. It is, indeed, incredible, that neither the multitude of enemies, nor the thick showers of javelins, nor the loud outcries of his assailants, could in the least alarm him; and that he alone should have spread havoc and terror among so many thousands. But seeing that he was likely to be overpowered by numbers, he fixed himself against the trunk of a tree that stood by the wall, by the help of which he long resisted a host, when, his danger being known, his friends leaped down to him, many of whom were slain, and the battle continued doubtful, till the whole army, making a breach in the wall, came to his aid. Being wounded in the struggle by an arrow, and likely to faint through loss of blood, he placed his knee on the ground, and fought till he had killed the man by whom he had been wounded. The curing of the wound caused him more suffering than the wound itself. </p>                        </div>

Taking the city afterwards by storm, and returning to the fleet, he made oblations to the ocean, praying for a prosperous return to his country; and having thus, as it were, driven his chariot round the goal, and fixed the boundaries of his empire, as far as either the deserts would suffer him to proceed by land, or the sea was navigable, he sailed up the mouth of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/254683WInd class=place long=68.3192 lat=25.4487>Indus</a> with the tide.

This munificence was highly prized, not only for the sum given, but for the character of the gift, and was received not more thankfully by the debtors than by the creditors, exaction being as troublesome to the one as payment to the other. Twenty thousand talents were expended in this largess. Discharging some of the veterans, he recruited the army with younger soldiers. But those that were retained, murmuring at the discharge of the older men, demanded that they themselves should be released likewise; desiring that 'their years, not of life, but of service, should be counted,' and thinking it reasonable that 'those who had been enlisted in the service together, should together be set free from the service.' Nor did they address the king only with entreaties, but also with reproaches, bidding him 'carry on his wars alone, with the aid of his father <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>Ammon</a>, since he looked with disdain on his soldiers.' <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, on the other hand, sometimes upbraided his men, and sometimes charged them in gentle terms, 'not to tarnish their glorious services by mutiny.'

But as if, by this reply, he had sounded the signal for battle among his friends, or had thrown the apple of discord amongst them, they all rose in emulation against each other, and tried to gain the favour of the army by secretly paying court to the common soldiers.

He was a man endowed with powers of mind far beyond ordinary human capacity. His mother <a href=/people/272 target=_blank>Olympias</a>, the night in which she conceived him, dreamed that she was entwined with a huge <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>; nor was she deceived by her drearn; for she certainly bore in her womb a conception superior to mortality; and though her descent from the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aeacidae</a>, a family of the remotest antiquity, and the royal dignity of her father, brother, husband, and indeed of all her ancestors, conferred sufficient splendour upon her, yet by no one's influence was she rendered more illustrious than that of her son. Some omens of his future greatness appeared at his birth. Two <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagles</a> sat the whole of the day on which he was born on the top of his father's palace, giving indication of his double empire over Europe and Asia. The very same day, too, his father received the news of two victories, one in the war with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=ethnic long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyrians</a>, the other in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games, to which he had sent some four-horse chariots; an omen which portended to the child the conquest of the world. As a boy, he was ably instructed in elementary learning; and, when his boyhood was past, he improved himself, for five years, under his famous instructor <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>. On taking possession of the throne, he gave orders that he should be styled 'King of all the earth and of the world; ' and he inspired his soldiers with such confidence in him, that, when he was present, they feared the arms of no enemy, though they themselves were unarmed. He, in consequence, never engaged with any enemy whom he did not conquer, besieged no city that he did not take, and invaded no nation that he did not subjugate. He was overcome at last, not by the prowess of any enemy, but by a conspiracy of those whom he trusted, and the treachery of his own subjects. </p>                        </div>

But the conquered nations could not give credit to the report of his death, because, as they had believed him to be invincible, they had also conceived that he was immortal, reflecting how frequently he had been snatched from imminent destruction, and how often, when he was given up for lost, he had suddenly presented himself to his soldiers, not only safe, but victorious. As soon, however, as the report of his death was confirmed, all the barbarous nations, whom he had shortly before subdued, lamented for him, not as an enemy, but as a father. The mother, too, of King <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a>, who, though she had been reduced, after the death of her son, from the summit of royal dignity to the state of a captive, had, till that day, through the kindness of the conqueror, never felt weary of life, committed suicide when she heard of the death of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>; not that she felt more for an enemy than she had felt for her son, but because she had experienced the attention of a son from him whom she had feared as an enemy. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, on the other hand, did not mourn for him as a countryman, and a prince of such eminence, but rejoiced at his death as at that of an enemy, execrating his excessive severity and the perpetual hardships of war to which he exposed them. The chiefs, moreover, were looking to sovereignty and offices of command; the common soldiers to the treasury and heaps of gold, as a prize unexpectedly presented to their grasp; the one meditating on the possibility of seizing the throne, the other on the means of securing wealth and plenty; for there were in the treasury fifty thousand talents, while the annual tribute produced thirty thousand. Nor did the friends of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> look to the throne without reason; for they were men of such ability and authority, that each of them might have been taken for a king. Such was the personal gracefulness, the commanding stature, and the eminent powers of body and mind, apparent in all of them, that whoever did not know them, would have thought that they had been selected, not from one nation, but from the whole earth. Never before, indeed, did <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, or any other country, abound with such a multitude of distinguished men; whom <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> first, and afterwards <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, had selected with such skill, that they seemed to have been chosen, not so much to attend them to war, as to succeed them on the throne.

Their very equality inflamed their discord, no one being so far superior to the rest, that any other would submit to him.

The leaders among them, all, however, were the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=ethnic long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolians</a>. <br />This being reported to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he gave orders that a thousand ships of war should be raised among his allies, with which he might carry on war in the west; and he intended to make an expedition, with a powerful force, to level <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> with the ground. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, in consequence, collecting an army of thirty thousand men and two hundred ships, went to war with <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, to whom the government of Greece had been assigned; and when he declined to come to battle, and sheltered himself within the walls of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224PHer class=place long=22.4313 lat=38.794>Heraclea</a>, they besieged him there; At that time <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> orator, who had been banished from his country on the charge of taking gold from <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a> (a man who had fled from <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s severity), bribing him to prevail on the city to go to war with <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, happened then to be living in exile at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg class=place long=23.34285 lat=37.997>Megara</a>, and learning that <a href=/people/731 target=_blank>Hyperides</a> was sent as an ambassador by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> to persuade the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=ethnic long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesians</a> to join in the war, followed him, and, by his eloquence, brought over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>, and other states, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> interest. For this service a ship was sent for him by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and he was recalled from banishment.

This occurrence gave so much encouragement to <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, that he ventured to break down the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> rampart. He then sought assistance from <a href=/people/5744 target=_blank>Leonatus</a>, who was soon reported to be approaching with his army; but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> met him in battle array, and he was severely wounded in an action of the cavalry, and died. <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, though he saw his auxiliaries defeated, was yet rejoiced at the death of <a href=/people/5744 target=_blank>Leonatus</a>, congratulating himself that his rival was taken off, and his force added to his own. Taking <a href=/people/5744 target=_blank>Leonatus</a>'s army under his command, therefore, and thinking himself a match for the enemy, even in a regular battle, he immediately released himself from the siege, and marched away to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>. The forces of the Greeks, too, having driven the enemy from the territory of Greece, went off to their several cities. </p>                        </div>

This response appearing but a jest, by reason of the paucity of inhabitants in the island of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364255PThe class=place long=25.477 lat=36.364>Thera</a>, from which a colony was desired to go to build a city in a country of such vast extent as Africa, the matter was neglected. Some time after, the Therans, as being guilty of disobedience, were forced by a pestilence to comply with the god's directions. But the number of the colonists was so extremely small that they scarcely filled one ship. Arriving in Africa, they dislodged the inhabitants from a hill named Cyras, and took possession of it for themselves, on account both of the pleasantness of the situation and the abundance of springs in it. Here <a href=/people/586 target=_blank>Battus</a>, their leader, the strings of his tongue being loosed, began to speak; which circumstance, as one part of the god's promises was fulfilled, gave them encouragement to entertain the further hope of building a city. Pitching their camp, accordingly, they received information of an old tradition, that <a href=/people/7063 target=_blank>Cyrene</a>, a maiden of extraordinary beauty, was carried off by <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394230LPel class=place long=23.046 lat=39.437>Pelion</a>, a mountain in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, and brought to that very mountain on which they had seized a hill, where, becoming pregnant by the god, she brought forth four sons, <a href=/people/3435 target=_blank>Nomius</a>, <a href=/people/1065 target=_blank>Aristaeus</a>, Authocus, and <a href=/people/12140 target=_blank>Argaeus</a>; and that a party being sent by her father <a href=/people/3859 target=_blank>Hypsaeus</a>, king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs class=place long=22.3 lat=39.4>Thessaly</a>, to seek for the damsel, were so attracted by the charms of the place, that they settled there with her.

But this project did not escape <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>; the plot was in consequence turned, upon the contrivers of it; and they who expected to attack him unguarded, were attacked themselves when they were on their march, and wearied with watching through the previous night.

He boldly gave notice, however, that 'if any one of them felt dismayed at the news, he had full liberty to depart.'

Such veneration was there for the greatness of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, that the influence of hig sacred name was sought even by means of women. <br />When he returned to his camp, letters were found scattered through it, in which great rewards were offered to any that should bring the head of <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>. This coming to his knowledge, <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, assembling his men, first offered them his congratulations that 'none had been found among them who preferred the expectation of a reward stained with blood to the obligation of his military oath.' He then craftily added that these letters had been forged by himself to sound their feelings; but that his life was in the hands of them all; and that neither <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> nor any other general would be willing to conquer by such means as would afford the worst of examples against himself.' By acting thus, he both preserved for the present the attachment of such as were wavering, and made it likely that if anything similar should happen in future, the soldiers would think that they were not tampered with by the enemy, but sounded by their own general.

After taking everything into consideration, therefore, he thought it best to apply to the <a href=/people/12213 target=_blank>Argyraspides</a> of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, a body of men that had never yet been conquered, and radiant with the glory of so many victories. But the <a href=/people/12213 target=_blank>Argyraspides</a> disdained all leaders in comparison with <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, and thought service under other generals dishonourable to the memory of so great a monarch. <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> had, therefore, to address them with flattery; he spoke to each of them in the language of a suppliant, calling them his 'fellow-soldiers,' his 'patrons,' or his 'companions in the dangers and exploits of the east;' sometimes styling them 'his refuge for protection, and his only security;' saying that 'they were the only troops by whose valour the east had been subdued, the only troops that had gone beyond the achievements of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a> and the monuments of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>; that by them <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had become great, by them had attained divine honours and immortal glory;' and he begged them 'to receive him, not so much in the character of a general, as in that of a fellow-soldier, and to allow him to be one of their body.' Being received on these terms, he gradually succeeded, first by giving them hints individually, and afterwards by gently correcting whatever was done amiss, in gaining the sole command. Nothing could be done in the camp without him; nothing managed without the aid of his judgment. </p>                        </div>

In this battle they lost, with their wives and children, not only their glory from so many wars, but also the booty obtained in their long service. But <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a>, who was the cause of their disaster, and had no other hope of safety remaining, encouraged them after their repulse, assuring them that 'they had the superiority in courage, as five thousand of the enemy had been slain by them; and that if they persevered in the war, their enemies would gladly sue for peace;' adding, that 'the losses, by which they estimated their defeat, were two thousand women, and a few children and slaves, which they might better recover by conquering, than by yielding the victory.' The <a href=/people/12213 target=_blank>Argyraspides</a>, on the other hand, declared that 'they would neither attempt a retreat, after the loss of their property and wives, nor would they war against their own children,' and pursued him with reproaches 'for having involved them, when they were returning home after so many years of completed service, and with the fruits of so many enterprises, and when on the point of being disbanded, in fresh efforts and vast struggles in the field; for having deluded them, when they were recalled, as it were, from their own hearths, and from the very threshold of their country, with vain promises; and for not allowing them, after having lost all the gains of their fortunate service, to support quietly under their defeat the burden of a poor and unhappy old age.' Immediately after, without the knowledge of their leaders, they sent deputies to <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>, requesting that 'he would order what was theirs to be restored to them.' <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> promised that 'he would restore what they asked, if they would deliver up <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> to him.'

Four times within the present year have you bound yourselves by oath to obey me; but on that point I shall say nothing, for reproaches do not become the unfortunate. One favour only I entreat, that, if the performance of <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>'s promises depends on my life, you would allow me to die among yourselves; for to him it signifies nothing how or where I fall, and I shall be delivered from an ignominious end. If I obtain this request, I release you from the oath by which you have so often devoted yourselves to me. Or if you are ashamed to offer violence to me at my entreaty, give me a sword, and permit your general to do for you, without the obligation of an oath, that which you have taken an oath to do for your general.' Not being able, however, to obtain his request, he changed his tone of entreaty to that of anger, and exclaimed, 'May the gods, then, the avengers of perjury, look down in judgment upon you, ye accursed wretches, and bring upon you such deaths as you have brought upon your leaders. It was you, the same who now stand before me, that were lately sprinkled with the blood of <a href=/people/294 target=_blank>Perdiccas</a>, and that planned a similar end for <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>.

Then, full of indignation, he began to walk before his guards towards the camp of <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>.

For when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, in his anger, had pretended that <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a> the philosopher, for his opposition to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> mode of doing obeisance, was concerned in a plot that had been formed against him, and, by cruelly mangling all his limbs, and cutting off his ears, nose, and lips, had rendered him a shocking and miserable spectacle, and had had him carried about, also, shut up in a cage with a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>, for a terror to others, <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, who was accustomed to listen to <a href=/people/342 target=_blank>Callisthenes</a>, and to receive precepts of virtue from him, took pity on so great a man, undergoing punishment, not for any crime, but for freedom of speech, and furnished him with poison to relieve him from his misery. At this act <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was so displeased, that he ordered <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> to be exposed to a fierce <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>; but when the beast, furious at the sight of him, had made a spring towards him, <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> plunged his hand, wrapped in his cloak, into the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>'s mouth, and, seizing fast hold of his tongue, killed him. This exploit being related to the king, his wonder at it ended in pleasure, and he regarded <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> with more affection than before, on account of his extraordinary bravery. <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, likewise, endured the ill-treatment of the king with magnanimity, as that of a parent.

His brother <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, having previously attempted to do him the same service, had expired in the king's arms. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, however, as he alighted from his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, happened to wound <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a> in the forehead with the point of his spear, so severely that the blood could not by any means be stopped, till the king, taking off his diadem, placed it on his head by way of closing the wound; an act which was the first omen of royal dignity to <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>.

The merit of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> was well known, and his birth had been attended with extraordinary circumstances. His mother <a href=/people/948 target=_blank>Laodice</a>, being married to <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, a man of eminence among <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>'s generals, seemed to herself, in a dream, to have conceived from a union with <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, and, after becoming pregnant, to have received from him, as a reward for her compliance, a ring, on the stone of which was engraved an anchor, and which she was desired to give to the child that she should bring forth. A ring similarly engraved, which was found the next day in the bed, and the figure of an anchor, which was visible on the thigh of <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> when he was born, made this dream extremely remarkable.

This mark of his paternity continued also among his descendants; for his sons and grandsons had an anchor on their thigh, as a natural proof of their extraction.; After the division of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> empire among the followers of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, he carried on several wars in the east. He first took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and then, his strength being increased by this success, subdued the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=ethnic long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrians</a>. He next made an expedition into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, which, after the death of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, had shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck, and put his governors to death. The author of this liberation was <a href=/people/4292 target=_blank>Sandrocottus</a>, who afterwards, however, turned their semblance of liberty into slavery; for, making himself king, he oppressed the people whom he had delivered from a foreign power, with a cruel tyranny. This man was of mean origin, but was stimulated to aspire to regal power by supernatural encouragement; for, having offended <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by his boldness of speech, and orders being given to kill him, he saved himself by swiftness of foot; and while he was lying asleep, after his fatigue, a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> of great size having come up to him, licked off with his tongue the sweat that was running from him, and after gently waking him, left him. Being first prompted by this prodigy to conceive hopes of royal dignity, he drew together a band of robbers, and solicited the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> to support his new sovereignty. Some time after, as he was going to war with the generals of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, a wild elephant of great bulk presented itself before him of its own accord, and, as if tamed down to gentleness, took him on its back, and became his guide in the war, and conspicuous in fields of battle. <a href=/people/4292 target=_blank>Sandrocottus</a>, having thus acquired a throne, was in possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>, when <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> was laying the foundations of his future greatness; who, after making a league with him, and settling his affairs in the east, proceeded to join in the war against <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a>. As soon as the forces, therefore, of all the confederates were united, a battle was fought, in which <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> was slain, and his son <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> put to flight. <br />But the allied generals, after thus terminating the war with the enemy, turned their arms again upon each other, and, as they could not agree about the spoil, were divided into two parties. <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a> joined <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>. <a href=/people/146 target=_blank>Cassander</a> dying, <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, his son, succeeded him.

The cause of this matricide was that, in the division of the kingdom between the brothers, she seemed to have favoured <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. This deed appeared the more atrocious to every one, as there was no proof of injustice on the part of the mother; although, indeed, in a case of matricide, no reason can be alleged sufficient to justify the crime. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, in consequence, resolving to go to war with his brother, to avenge his mother's death, solicited aid from <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>; and <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, in hopes of seizing the throne of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, made no delay in complying with his request. <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, alarmed at his approach, persuaded <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, his son-in-law, rather to be reconciled to his brother than to allow his father's enemy to enter <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>. <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, therefore, finding that a reconciliation was commenced between the brothers, removed <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by treachery, and, having seized on the throne of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, called an assembly of the army, to defend himself before them for the murder.

As, both, however, refused their request, they had recourse to <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>, whom they themselves had exiled; such being the urgency of their distresses, that they recalled to the guardian ship of his country him whom they had forbidden to enter his country. But <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>, being rendered more desperate by his banishment, and regarding the dissension among the people as a means of securing to himself the government, first sought a secret interview with <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, the enemy of his countrymen, and made a league with him on the understanding that when he was re-established in his country, he should, on betraying the city into his hands, be made lieutenant-governor of it. But the treachery which he had conceived against his countrymen, he afterwards turned against <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself; for on returning from banishment, to be as it were the arbiter of the disputes in the city, he, at the time appointed for delivering the town to <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a>, made <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridates</a> himself prisoner, with a party of his friends, and released him from captivity only on the receipt of a large sum of money. And as, in this case, he suddenly changed himself from a friend into an enemy, so, in regard to his countrymen, he soon, from a supporter of the senate's cause, became a patron of the common people, and not only inflamed the populace against those who had conferred his power upon him, and by whom he had been recalled into his country and established in the citadel, but even exercised upon his benefactors the most atrocious inflictions of tyrannic cruelty. Summoning the people to an assembly, he declared that 'he would no longer support the senate in their proceedings against the populace, but would even interpose his authority, if they persisted in their former severities; and that, if the people thought themselves able to check the tyranny of the senate, he would retire with his soldiers, and take no further part in their dissensions; but that, if they distrusted their ability to make resistance, he would not be wanting to aid them in taking revenge. They might therefore,' he added, 'determine among themselves; they might bid him withdraw, if they pleased, or might request him to stay as a sharer in the popular cause.' The people, induced by these fair speeches, conferred on him the supreme authority, and, while they were incensed at the power of the senate, surrendered themselves, with their wives and children, as slaves to the power of a single tyrant. <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a> then apprehended sixty senators (the rest had taken flight), and threw them into prison. The people rejoiced that the senate was overthrown, and especially that it had fallen by means of a leader among the senators, and that, by a reverse of fortune, their support was turned to their destruction. <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>, by threatening all his prisoners with death, made the price offered for their ransom the higher; and, after receiving from them large sums of money, as if he would secretly withdraw them from the violence threatened by the people, despoiled those of their lives whom he had previously despoiled of their fortunes. </p>                        </div>

But such marriages were more intolerable to the women than immediate death; and many, in consequence, killed themselves before the nuptial rites were celebrated, and many in the midst of them, first killing their new husbands, and delivering themselves from dishonourable sufferings by a spirit of noble virtue. A battle was then fought, in which the tyrant, being victorious, dragged such of the senators as he took prisoners before the faces of their countrymen in triumph. Returning into the city, he threw some into prison, stretched others on the rack, and put others to death; and not a place in the city was unvisited by the tyrant's cruelty. Arrogance was added to severity, insolence to inhumanity. From a course of continued good fortune, he sometimes forgot that he was a man, sometimes called himself the son of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. When he appeared in public, a golden <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a>, as a token of his parentage, was carried before him; he wore a purple robe, buskins like kings in tragedies, and a crown of gold. His son he named Ceraunos, to mock the gods, not only with false statements, but with impious names. Two noble youths, <a href=/people/3797 target=_blank>Chion</a> and <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a>, incensed that he should dare to commit such outrages, and desiring to deliver their country, formed a conspiracy to put him to death. They were disciples of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> the philosopher, and being desirous to exhibit to their country the virtue in which they were daily instructed by the precepts of their master, placed fifty of their relations, as if they were their attendants, in ambush; while they themselves, in the character of men who had a dispute to be settled, went into the citadel to the tyrant. Gaining admission, as being well known, the tyrant, while he was listening attentively to the one that spoke first, was killed by the other. But as their accomplices were too late in coming to their support, they were overpowered by the guards; and hence it happened that though the tyrant was killed, their country was not liberated. <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/134 target=_blank>Clearchus</a>, made himself tyrant in a similar way; and for many years, with various successive changes, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388224PHer class=ethnic long=22.4313 lat=38.794>Heracleans</a> continued under the yoke of tyrants. </p>                        </div>

This was the first commencement of his calamities, the prelude to approaching rain; for executions of several great men were added to the murder of his son, who were put to death for expressing concern at the young prince's fate; and, in consequence, both those about the court who escaped this cruelty, and those who were in command of the troops, began at once to desert to <a href=/people/72 target=_blank>Seleucus</a>, and incite him to make war upon <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>; an enterprise to which he was already inclined from a desire to emulate his glory.

But at this age they both had the fire of youth, and an insatiable desire of power; for though they alone possessed the whole world, they yet thought themselves confined within narrow limits, and measured their course of life, not by their length of years, but by the extent to which they carried their dominion. </p>                        </div>

Of his daughters he gave some in marriage to the neighbouring princes, and by means of these alliances acquired great power. He gave to <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>, the son of King <a href=/people/64 target=_blank>Priam</a>, for his eminent services, the kingdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403197RCha class=ethnic long=19.7 lat=40.3>Chaonians</a>, and <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> the widow of <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a> in marriage, after she had been his own wife, he having received her at the division of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> spoil.

The throne afterwards passed in regular descent to <a href=/people/4434 target=_blank>Arrybas</a>, over whom, as he was an orphan, and the only survivor of a noble family, guardians were publicly appointed, the concern of all being so much the greater to preserve and educate him.

He was the first, accordingly, that established laws, a senate, annual magistrates, and a regular form of government; and as a settlement was found for the people by <a href=/people/831 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>, so a more civilized way of life was introduced by <a href=/people/4434 target=_blank>Arrybas</a>.

The child, too, being sought for by the populace to be put to death, through their hatred to the father, was concealed and carried off into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, and delivered to <a href=/people/1089 target=_blank>Beroe</a>, who was the wife of king <a href=/people/1094 target=_blank>Glaucias</a>, and of the family of the <a href=/people/1328 target=_blank>Aeacidae</a>, to be brought up.

Many cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, moved by the result of this battle, surrendered to <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a>; among others also <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=place long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locri</a>, betraying the Roman garrison, revolted to him.

The nation of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=ethnic long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyrians</a> was founded by the Phaenicians, who, suffering from an earthquake, and abandoning their country, settled at first near the Syrian lake, and afterwards on the coast near the sea, where they built a city, which, from the abundance of fish, they named <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a>, for so the Phaenicians call a fish in their language. Many years after, their city being stormed by the king of the Ascalonians, sailing away to the place where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> stands, they built that city the year before the fall of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>. Here, harassed for a long time, and in various ways, by attacks from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, they resisted, indeed, successfully, but, as their strength was exhausted, they suffered the most cruel treatment from their slaves, who were then extraordinarily numerous. These traitors, having entered into a conspiracy, killed their masters and all the free people of the city, and thus, becoming masters of the place, took possession of the houses of their owners, assumed the government, appropriated wives to themselves, and begot, what they themselves were not, freemen. Out of so many thousands of slaves, there was one who was moved to compassion by the mild disposition of his aged master and the hard fortune of his little son, and looked upon them, not with savage fierceness, but with humanity, affection, and pity. He put them out of the way, therefore, as if they had been killed; and when the slaves came to deliberate about the condition of their government, and had resolved that a king should be elected from their own body, and that he should be preferred, as most acceptable to the gods, who should first see the rising sun, he mentioned the matter to <a href=/people/735 target=_blank>Strato</a> (for that was the name of his master), who was then in concealment. Being instructed by him, and proceeding with the rest, about the middle of the night, to a certain plain, he alone, when they were all looking towards the east, kept his eye directed towards the west. This at first seemed madness to the others, to look in the west for the rising sun; but when day began to advance, and the rising luminary to shine on the highest eminences of the city, he, while all the rest were watching to see the sun itself, was the first to point out to them the sunshine on the loftiest pinnacle of the town. This thought seemed above the wit of a slave; and when they asked him who had put it into his head, he confessed that it was his master. It was then seen how far the abilities of freemen surpass those of slaves, who, though they may be first in viciousness, are not first in wisdom. The old man and his son were therefore spared; and the slaves, thinking that they had been preserved by the interposition of some deity, made <a href=/people/735 target=_blank>Strato</a> king. After his death, the throne descended to his son, and subsequently to his grandsons. This atrocity of these slaves was much noticed, and was a terrible example to the whole world. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> the Great, when he was prosecuting his wars, some time after, in the east, having taking the city, crucified, as an avenger of the general safety, and in memory, of the former massacre, all those who survived the siege; preserving from injury only the family of <a href=/people/735 target=_blank>Strato</a>, and restoring the throne to his descendants; and sending to the island, at the same time, inhabitants that were free-born and guiltless, that, as the race of slaves was extirpated, an entirely new generation might be established in the city. </p>                        </div>

Meanwhile their king died at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, appointing his son <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a> and his daughter <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a>, a maiden of extraordinary beauty, his heirs. But the people gave the throne to <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a>, who was quite a boy. <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a> married <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a>, her uncle, who was priest of <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, a dignity next to that of the king. <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a> had great but concealed riches, having laid up his gold, for fear of the king, not in his house, but in the earth; a fact of which, though people had no certain knowledge of it, report was not silent. <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a>, excited by the account, and forgetful of the laws of humanity, murdered his uncle, who was also his brother-in-law, without the least regard to natural affection. <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a> long entertained a hatred to her brother for his crime, but at last, dissembling her detestation, and assuming mild looks for the time, she secretly contrived a mode of flight, admitting into her confidence some of the leading men of the city, in whom she saw that there was a similar hatred of the king, and an equal desire to escape. She then addressed her brother in such a way as to deceive him; pretending that 'she had a desire to remove to his house, in order that the home of her husband might no longer revive in her, when she was desirous to forget him, the oppressive recollection of her sorrows, and that the sad remembrances of him might no more present themselves to her eyes.' To these words of his sister, <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a> was no unwilling listener, thinking that with her the gold of <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a> would come to him. But <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a> put the attendants, who were sent by the king to assist in her removal, on board some vessels in the early part of the evening, and sailing out into the deep, made them throw some loads of sand, put up in sacks, as if it was money, into the sea. Then, with tears and mournful ejaculations, she invoked <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a>, entreating that 'he would favourably receive his wealth which he had left behind him, and accept that as an offering to his shade, which he had found to be the cause of his death.' Next she addressed the attendants, and said that 'death had long been desired by her, but as for them, cruel torments and a direful end awaited them, for having disappointed the tyrant's avarice of those treasures, in the hopes of obtaining which he had committed fratricide.' Having thus struck terror into them all, she took them with her as companions of her flight. Some bodies of senators, too, who were ready against that night, came to join her, and having offered a sacrifice to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, whose priest <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a> had been, proceeded to seek a settlement in exile. </p>                        </div>

The stipulation was received as a manifest omen of good fortune. It was a custom among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a> to send their daughters, on stated days before their marriage, to the sea-shore, to prostitute themselves, and thus procure money for their marriage portions, and to pay, at the same time, offerings to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a> for the preservation of their chastity in time to come. Of these <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a> ordered about eighty to be seized and taken on board, that her men might have wives, and her city a population. During the course of these transactions, <a href=/people/2015 target=_blank>Pygmalion</a>, having heard of his sister's flight, and preparing to pursue her with unfeeling hostility, was scarcely induced by the prayers of his mother and the menaces of the gods to remain quiet; the inspired augurs warning him that 'he would not escape with impunity, if he interrupted the founding of a city that was to become the most prosperous in the world.' By this means some respite was given to the fugitives; and <a href=/people/433 target=_blank>Elissa</a>, arriving in a gulf of Africa, attached the inhabitants of the coast, who rejoiced at the arrival of foreigners, and the opportunity of bartering commodities with them, to her interest. Having then bargained for a piece of ground, as much as could be covered with an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>-hide, where she might refresh her companions, wearied with their long voyage, until she could conveniently resume her progress, she directed the hide to be cut into the thinnest possible strips, and thus acquired a greater portion of ground than she had apparently demanded; whence the place had afterwards the name of <a href=/people/3548 target=_blank>Byrsa</a>. The people of the neighbourhood subsequently gathering about her, bringing, in hopes of gain, many articles to the strangers for sale, and gradually fixing their abodes there, some resemblance of a city arose from the concourse. Ambassadors from the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>, too, brought them presents as relatives, and exhorted them 'to build a city where they had chanced to obtain a settlement.'

At the commencement of digging the foundations an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>'s head was found, which was an omen that the city would be wealthy, indeed, but laborious and always enslaved. It was therefore removed to another place, where the head of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> was found, which, indicating that the people would be warlike and powerful, portended an auspicious site.

The deputies, fearing to report this message to the queen, acted towards her with Carthaginian artifice, saying that 'the king asked for some person to teach him and his Africans a more civilized way of life, but who could be found that would leave his relations and go to barbarians, and people that were living like wild beasts?' Being then reproached by the queen, 'in case they refused a hard life for the benefit of their country, to which, should circumstances require, their life itself was due,' they disclosed the king's message, saying that 'she herself, if she wished her city to be secure, must do what she required of others.' Being caught by this subtlety, she at last said (after calling for a long time with many tears and mournful lamentations on the name of her husband <a href=/people/4808 target=_blank>Acerbas</a>), that 'she would go whither the fate of her city called her.' Taking three months for the accomplishment of her resolution, and having raised a funeral pile at the extremity of the city, she sacrificed many victims, as if she would appease the shade of her husband, and make her offerings to him before her marriage; and then, taking a sword, she ascended the pile, and, looking towards the people, said, that 'she would go to her husband as they had desired her,' and put an end to her life with the sword.

Being afflicted, among other calamities, with a pestilence, they adopted a cruel religious ceremony, an execrable abomination, as a remedy for it; for they immolated human beings as victims, and brought children (whose age excites pity even in enemies) to the altars, entreating favour of the gods by shedding the blood of those for whose life the gods are generally wont to be entreated. </p>                        </div>

At this time Cartalo, the son of <a href=/people/2241 target=_blank>Malchus</a> the exiled general, returning by his father's camp from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a> (whither he had been sent by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, to carry the tenth of the plunder of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, which his father had taken, to <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>), and being desired by his father to wait on him, replied that 'he would discharge his religious duties to the public, before those of merely private obligation.' His father, though he was indignant at his conduct, was nevertheless afraid to obstruct him in the performance of his religious offices. Some days after, Cartalo, having obtained leave of absence from the people, and returning to his father, presented himself before all the people, dressed in the purple and fillets of his sacerdotal dignity, when his father took him aside, and said, 'Hast thou dared, most unnatural wretch, to appear before so many of thy miserable countrymen, thus arrayed in purple and gold, and to enter, with all the marks of peaceful prosperity about thee, and exulting as it were in triumph, into this sad and mournful camp? Couldst thou display thyself nowhere else to thy fellow creatures? Was no place fitter for it than where the misery of thy father, and the distress of his unhappy banishment, were to be seen? I have to add, too, that when thou wast summoned a short time ago, thou proudly despisedst, I do not say thy father, but certainly the general of thy countrymen. And what else dost thou exhibit in that purple and those crowns, but the titles of my victories? Since thou, therefore, acknowledgest nothing in thy father but the name of an exile, I also will assume the character, not of a father, but of a general, and will make such an example of thee, that no one may hereafter dare to sport with the miseries and sorrows of a parent.' He accordingly ordered him to be nailed, in all his finery, on a high cross within view of the city. A few days after he took <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, and assembling the people, complained of the injustice of his banishment, pleaded necessity as his excuse for making war upon them, and added that 'being content with his victory, and the punishment of the authors of their country's misery, he granted a free pardon for his unjust banishment to all the rest.' Having accordingly put ten senators to death, he left the city to the government of its laws. But being accused himself, shortly after, of aspiring to be king, he paid the penalty of his twofold cruelty to his son and his country. He was succeeded, as commander-in-chief, by <a href=/people/343 target=_blank>Mago</a>, by whose exertions the power of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, the extent of its territories, and its military glory, was much increased. </p>                        </div>

They all then crowded to the harbour, and inquired of the few that came out of their ships, survivors of the calamity, respecting their relatives.

He, lifting up his hands to heaven, sometimes bewailed his own lot, sometimes the misfortune of the state, and sometimes complained of 'the gods, who had deprived him of such honours obtained in the field, and the glory of so many victories, who, after he had taken so many cities, and had defeated the enemy by land and sea, had destroyed his victorious army, not by war, but by a pestilence. Yet he brought,' he said, 'this important consolation to his countrymen, that though the enemy might rejoice at their ill-success, they could assume no glory from it, as they could neither say that those who had died were slain by them, nor that those who had returned had been put to flight. That the plunder which they had taken in their deserted camp was not what they could exhibit as the spoils of a conquered enemy, but what they had seized, as falling to them for want of owners, through the accidental deaths of its possessors. That, as far as the enemy was concerned, they had come off conquerors; as to the pestilence, they were certainly conquered; but that, for himself, he took nothing more to heart than that he could not die among the brave, and was reserved, not to enjoy life, but to be the sport of calamity.

When he had walked, with such lamentations, through the city, and had arrived at the entrance to his own house, he dismissed the crowd that followed him, as if it were the last time that he should speak to them, and then, locking his door and admitting no one, not even his sons, to his presence, he put an end to his life. </p>                        </div>

This answer, from a city in alliance with them, the deputies did not despise, but going into the nearest temple, and offering sacrifice, they implored aid from those gods. The signs from the victims appearing favourable, and their request, as they supposed, being granted, they were no less rejoiced than if they were to carry the gods with them; and, spreading couches for them in the vessel, and setting out with happy omens, they brought their countrymen comfort though not assistance. </p>                        </div>

They hated the arms which they had unsuccessfully taken up, and would have abandoned their former way of life for one of luxury, had not <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> arisen among them. This philosopher was born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, the son of <a href=/people/475 target=_blank>Demaratus</a>, a rich merchant, and after being greatly advanced in wisdom, went first to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and afterwards to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, to learn the motions of the stars and study the origin of the universe, and acquired very great knowledge.

Furnished with all these attainments, he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Crotona</a>, and, by his influence, recalled the people, when they were giving themselves up to luxury, to the observance of frugality. He used daily to recommend virtue, and to enumerate the ill effects of luxury, and the misfortunes of states that had been ruined by its pestilential influence; and he thus produced in the people such a love of temperance, that it was at length thought incredible that any of them should be extravagant. He frequently gave instruction to the women apart from the men, and to the children apart from their parents. He impressed on the female sex the observance of chastity, and submission to their husbands; on the rising generation, modesty and devotion to learning. Through his whole course of instruction he exhorted all to love temperance, as the mother of every virtue; and he produced such an effect upon them by the constancy of his lectures, that the women laid aside their vestments embroidered with gold, and other ornaments and distinctions, as instruments of luxury, and, bringing them into the temple of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Juno</a>, consecrated them to the goddess, declaring that modesty, and not fine apparel, was the true adornment of their sex. How much he gained upon the yoking men, his victory over the stubborn minds of the women may serve to indicate. Three hundred of the young men, however, being united by an oath of fraternity, and living apart from the other citizens, drew the attention of the city upon them, as if they met for some secret conspiracy; and the people, when they were all collected in one building, proceeded to burn them in it.

The plot being disclosed to the magistrates by his agents, his destructive intentions were frustrated, but not punished, lest the matter, if publicly known, should occasion more trouble, in the case of so powerful a man, than the mere design of it had caused. Satisfied, therefore, with putting a stop to it, they merely set bounds by a decree to the expenses of marriage entertainments, and ordered the decree to be obeyed, not by him alone, but universally, that nothing personal to him, but the general correction of an abuse, might seem to be intended. Prevented by this measure, he, for a second attempt, raised the slaves, and appointing another day for the massacre of the senate, but finding himself again betrayed, he threw himself, for fear of being brought to trial, into a strong fortress with a body of twenty thousand armed slaves. Here, while he was soliciting the Africans, and the king of the Moors, to join him, he was captured, and after being scourged, having his eyes put out, and his arms and legs broken, as if atonement was to be exacted from every limb, he was put to death in the sight of the people, and his body, mangled with stripes, was nailed to a cross. All his children and relations, too, though guiltless, were delivered to the executioner, that no member of so nefarious a family might survive either to imitate his villainy, or to revenge his death. </p>                        </div>

He was not content with strolling about the streets, but would even stand drinking in them; he was not satisfied with being seen in taverns and impure houses, but would sit in them for whole days. He would dispute with the most abandoned fellows about the merest trifles, walk about in rags and dirt, and afford laughter to others more readily than he would laugh at them. He would stand in the shambles, devouring with his eyes what he was not able to purchase; he would wrangle with the dealers before the aediles, and do everything in such a manner as to appear an object of contempt rather than of fear. At last he assumed the profession of a schoolmaster, and taught children in the open streets, either that he might continually be seen in public by those who feared him, or might be more readily despised by those who did not fear him; for though he had still plenty of the vices peculiar to tyrants, yet his present conduct was an affectation of vices, and not the effect of nature, and he adopted it rather from cunning than from having lost the self-respect becoming a sovereign, having experienced how odious the names of tyrants are, even when they are deprived of power. He strove, therefore, to diminish the odium incurred from his past by the contemptibleness of his present life, not looking to honourable but to safe practices. Yet amidst all these arts of dissimulation, he was accused of aspiring to the sovereignty, and was left at liberty only because he was despised. </p>                        </div>

But with regard to this phenomenon <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> was at no less pains to satisfy them than he had been with regard to the war; alleging that, 'if it had happened before they set out, he should have thought it a portent unfavourable to their departure, but since it had occurred after they had set sail, its signification was directed against those to whom they were going. Besides,' he said, 'the eclipses of the heavenly bodies always presaged a change in the present state of things, and it was therefore certain that an alteration was foretold in the flourishing condition of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> and in their own adverse circumstances.' Having thus pacified his soldiers, he ordered all the ships, with the consent of the army, to be set on fire, in order that, the means of flight being taken away, they might understand that they must either conquer or die. <br />While they were devastating the country wherever they went, and laying farm-houses and fortresses in ashes, <a href=/people/381 target=_blank>Hanno</a> advanced to meet them with thirty thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>.

At the same time a great rumour of the destruction of the Carthaginian army, and of the capture of their cities, was spread through all Africa, and astonishment fell upon every one, wondering how so sudden a war could have surprised so great an empire, especially from an enemy already conquered. This wonder was gradually changed into a contempt for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>; and not long after, not only the populace of Africa, but the most eminent cities, out of fondness for change, revolted to <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, and furnished the victorious army with corn and money. </p>                        </div>

For after the departure of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> from the island, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, prosecuting the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> with less vigour, were reported to have been utterly cut off by <a href=/people/3336 target=_blank>Antander</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>.

But when he came, accordingly, with a numerous army, to take a share in the war, <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, after throwing him off his guard by the affability of his address and the abjectness of his flattery, and after they had supped together several times, and he had been adopted by <a href=/people/6729 target=_blank>Opheltas</a> as a son, put him to death, and taking the command of his forces, defeated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, who were renewing the war with all their might, in a second great battle, but with much loss to both armies. At this result of the contest, such despair was felt by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>, that, had not a mutiny occurred among the troops of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, <a href=/people/2843 target=_blank>Bomilcar</a>, the Carthaginian general, would have gone over to him with his army.

Immediately on his arrival, all the cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, having previously heard of his achievements in Africa, unanimously submitted to him; and being thus enabled to drive the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, he made himself master of the whole island. Returning afterwards to Africa, he was received by his army in a state of mutiny; for the discharge of their arrears of pay had been deferred by the son till the arrival of his father. Summoning them, therefore, to a general assembly, he proceeded to pacify them with soothing words, saying that 'pay was not to be asked of him, but to be taken from the enemy; that they must gain a common victory, and common spoil; and that they must continue to support him for a short time, till what remained of the war was finished, as they were certain that the capture of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a> would satisfy all their desires.' The mutiny being thus allayed, he led the army, after an interval of some days, against the camp of the enemy, but commencing an engagement too rashly, lost the greater part of his force. Retreating to his camp, therefore, and finding the odium of his rash engagement affecting his character, and dreading, at the same time, a revival of the former murmurs at his failure in paying the arrears, he fled from his camp at midnight, attended only by his son <a href=/people/1440 target=_blank>Archagathus</a>. When the soldiers heard of his departure, they were in no less consternation than if they had been captured by the enemy, exclaiming that 'they had been twice deserted by their leader in the midst of the enemy's country, and that the care of their lives had been abandoned by him by whom not even their burial should have been neglected.' As they were going to pursue <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, they were met by some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a>, and returned to the camp, but not without having seized and brought back <a href=/people/1440 target=_blank>Archagathus</a>, who, through mistaking his way in the night, had been separated from his father. <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, with the ships in which he had returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, and the men that he had left to guard them, arrived safe at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>; affording a signal instance of dishonourable conduct, a prince deserting his army, and a father abandoning his children. <br />In Africa, meanwhile, after the flight of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, his soldiers, making a capitulation with the enemy, and putting to death the sons of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, surrendered themselves to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a>. <a href=/people/1440 target=_blank>Archagathus</a>, when he was going to be killed by <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a>, a former friend of his father, asked him 'what he thought <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a> would do to the children of him by whom he was rendered childless?' <a href=/people/312 target=_blank>Arcesilaus</a> replied, that 'he felt no concern, since he knew that his children would certainly survive those of <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>.'

Then, as if he were confined within too narrow limits in an island (a part of the dominion of which, even when he first began to rise, he could scarcely have hoped to obtain), he proceeded, after the example of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, who had subdued many cities of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, to cross, over into that country. His first enemies there were the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a>, who, at that period, seem to have been the bravest and most powerful people of the country, and to have been extremely ready to attack their neighbours; for they had driven the inhabitants of many of the Greek cities from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and had conquered in war the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a> their founders, and made peace with them on equal terms; such being the fierceness of their nature, that they had no respect even for those to whom they owed their origin. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a> were accustomed to breed up their children with the same kind of education as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Spartans</a>; for, from their earliest boyhood, they were kept in the wilds among the shepherds, without any slaves to attend them, and even without clothes to wear or to sleep upon, that, from their first years, they might be accustomed to hardiness and spare diet, having no intercourse with the city. Their food was what they took in hunting, and their drink milk or water. Thus were they prepared for the toils of war. <br />Fifty of these people, who, at first, used to plunder the lands of their neighbours, but who, as numbers flocked to join them, increased in strength, and were tempted by hopes of greater booty, disturbed the whole of the neighbouring country; and <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, the tyrant of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, being wearied with complaints from his allies, had sent six hundred Africans to put a stop to their ravages. But the marauders, having seized a fort which the Africans had built, and which was betrayed into their hands by a woman named Bruttia, proceeded to build a city there for the shepherds, who, at the report of a new settlement, came in numbers to join them; and, from the name of the woman, they called themselves <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392165RBre class=ethnic long=16.5 lat=39.2>Bruttii</a>. <br />Their first war was with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404160RLeu class=ethnic long=16 lat=40.4>Lucanians</a>, from whom they sprung. Encouraged by a victory over them, and making peace on equal terms, they subdued the rest of their neighbours by force of arms, and acquired, in a short time, such extraordinary strength, that they were thought formidable even by princes.

Being affected by the distemper through his whole body, and a pestilential humour spreading through all his nerves and joints, he was tormented, as it were, by an intestine war among all his members. As his life was despaired of, a contention arose between his son and grandson, each claiming the right of succession to his power as if he were already dead; and the grandson, after killing the son, got possession of the supreme dignity. <a href=/people/103 target=_blank>Agathocles</a>, therefore, when the pain of his disease and his anxiety of mind were grown intolerable, the one being increased by the severity of the other, resolved on embarking his wife Texena, and two infant sons that he had by her, with all his treasure, and servants, and regal furniture (in which no king at that time was richer), and sending her back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, from whence he had received her, fearing that they would find the usurper of his power their enemy. His wife, however, long entreated that she might not be separated from her sick husband, that the affliction of her departure might not be added to the atrocities of his grandson, and that she might not be made to appear as cruel in forsaking her husband as he in attacking his grandfather; saying that, 'by marrying him, she not only engaged to share his good fortune, but all his fortune; nor would she unwillingly purchase, with the hazard of her own life, the privilege of receiving her husband's last breath, and of performing, with all the care of conjugal duty and affection, the last offices at his funeral, which, when she was gone, no one would take upon himself to discharge.' The little children, at parting, embraced and clung to their father with doleful lamentations; while the wife, who was to see her husband no more, could not desist from kissing him. Nor were the tears of the old man less moving; the children wept for their dying father, the father for his banished children. They bewailed the forlorn condition of their parent, a sick old man; he lamented that his offspring, born to the prospect, of a throne, should be left in want. At the same time the whole palace resounded with the cries of those who were witnesses to so cruel a separation.

Alarmed at this danger from another quarter, and uncertain what to do, or whither first to direct his efforts, he took time, while he was in suspense between the two, for consideration. As the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=ethnic long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthaginians</a> threatened him on one side, and the Romans on the other, it seemed hazardous not to transport a force into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and more hazardous to withdraw troops from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, lest the one should be lost by not receiving assistance, or the other by being deserted.

The fortune of <a href=/people/314 target=_blank>Hiero</a>, in his infancy, had been as it were a presage of his future dignity.

His extraction on the mother's side, however, was so mean as to be even dishonourable; for he was the child of a female slave, and was in consequence exposed by his father as a disgrace to his family. But, when he was thus left destitute of human aid, <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> for several days fed him with honey, which was heaped round him as he lay. Hence his father, admonished by a communication from the soothsayers, who signified that sovereign power was foreboded to the infant, took him home again, and brought him up most carefully with the hope that he would attain the promised honour. As he was learning his lesson at school, too, among his equals in age, a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, that suddenly appeared in the midst of the boys, snatched from him his book. And when he was grown up, and commencing his first campaign, an <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>eagle</a> settled on his shield, and an <a href=/people/10997 target=_blank>owl</a> upon his spear; a prodigy which indicated that he would be prudent in counsel, active in the field, and a king. He fought frequently, moreover, with persons that challenged him, and always gained the victory; and he was presented by king <a href=/people/85 target=_blank>Pyrrhus</a> with many military gifts. The handsomeness of his person was remarkable, and his bodily strength wonderful.

But the criminal intentions of <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> were understood by his sister.

Soon after, as if the spoils of mortals were too mean for him, he turned his thoughts to the temples of the immortal gods, saying, with a profane jest, that 'the gods, being rich, ought to be liberal to men.' He suddenly, therefore, directed his march towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a>, regarding plunder more than religion, and caring for gold more than for the wrath of the deities, 'who,' he said, 'stood in no need of riches, as being accustomed rather to bestow them on mortals.' <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SApo class=place long=22.5011 lat=38.48225>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> is situate on Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385226LPar class=place long=22.6219 lat=38.5354>Parnassus</a>, on a rock steep on all sides. A concourse of people, who, collecting from the parts around, through veneration for the majesty of the god, settled on the rock, formed a city there. Thus, not walls, but precipices, not defences formed by the hand, but by nature, protect the temple and the city; so that it is utterly uncertain whether the strength of the place, or the influence of the deity residing in it, attracts more admiration. The central part of the rock falls back in the shape of an amphitheatre; and, in consequence, if ever shouts are raised, or if the noise of trumpets is mingled with them, the sound, from the rocks echoing and re-echoing to one another, is heard many times repeated, and louder than it was made at first. This effect, on those who are ignorant of its cause, and are struck with wonder at it, produces a greater awe of the power of the god. In the winding of the rock, about half way up the hill; there is a small plain, and in it a deep fissure in the ground, which is open for giving oracles; for a cold exhalation, driven upwards by some force, as it were by a wind, produces in the minds of the priestesses a certain madness, and compels them, filled with the influence of the god, to give answers to such as consult them. Hence many rich presents of kings and nations are to be seen there, which, by their magnificence, testify the grateful feelings of those that have paid their vows, and their belief in the oracles given by the deity. </p>                        </div>

Two of the captains, Emanus and Thessalorus, who had joined him for a share in the booty, advised that 'no delay should be made,' while the enemy were unprovided for defence, and the alarm at their coming still fresh; that in the interval of a night, the courage of the enemy would perhaps revive, and assistance come to them; and that the approaches, which were now open, might be blocked up.' But the common soldiers, when, after a long endurance of scarcity, they found a country abounding with wine and other provisions, had dispersed themselves over the fields, rejoicing as much at the plenty as if they had gained a victory, and leaving their standards deserted, wandered about to seize on everything like conquerors. This conduct gave some respite to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225PDel class=ethnic long=22.5056 lat=38.4806>Delphians</a>. At the first report that the Gauls were approaching, the country people are said to have been prohibited by the oracle from carrying away their corn and wine from their houses.

Amidst this contest between the two, the priests of all the temples, as well as the priestesses themselves, with their hair loose, and with their decorations and fillets, rushed, trembling and frantic, into the front ranks of the combatants, exclaiming that 'the god was come; that they had seen him leap down into his temple through the opening roof; that, while they were all humbly imploring aid of the deity, a youth of extraordinary beauty, far above that of mortals, and two armed virgins, coming from the neighbouring temples of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, met them; that they had not only perceived them with their eyes, but had heard also the sound of a bow and the rattling of arms;' and they therefore conjured them with the strongest entreaties, 'not to delay, when the gods were leading them on, to spread slaughter among the enemy, and to share the victory with the powers of heaven.' Incited by these exhortations, they all rushed eagerly to the field of battle, where they themselves also soon perceived the presence of the divinity; for a part of the mountain, broken off by an earthquake, overwhelmed a host of the Gauls, and some of the densest bodies of the enemy were scattered abroad, not without wounds, and fell to the earth. A tempest then followed, which destroyed, with hail and cold, those that were suffering from bodily injuries. The general <a href=/people/1090 target=_blank>Brennus</a> himself, unable to endure the pain of his wounds, ended his life with his dagger. The other general, after punishing the advisers of the war, made off from Greece with all expedition, accompanied with ten thousand wounded men. But neither was fortune more favourable to those who fled; for in their terror, they passed no night under shelter, and no day without hardship and danger; and continual rains, snow congealed by the frost, famine, fatigue, and, what was the greatest evil, the constant want of sleep, consumed the wretched remains of the unfortunate army. The nations and people too, through whom they marched, pursued their stragglers, as if to spoil them. Hence it happened that, of so great an army, which a little before, presuming on its strength, contended even against the gods, not a man was left to be a memorial of its destruction. </p>                        </div>

But the Gauls were so struck with the vast quantity of gold and silver set before them, and so tempted with the richness of such a spoil, that they returned more inclined to war than they had come. The king had also ordered his elephants to be shown them, as monsters unknown to those barbarians, and his ships laden with stores to be displayed; little thinking that he was thus exciting the cupidity of those to seize his treasures, whom he sought to strike with terror by the ostentation of his strength. The ambassadors, returning to their countrymen, and exaggerating every thing excessively, set forth at once the wealth and unsuspiciousness of the king; saying that 'his camp was filled with gold and silver, but secured neither by rampart nor trench, and that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a>, as if they had sufficient protection in their wealth, neglected all military duties, apparently thinking that, as they had plenty of gold, they had no use for steel.' </p>                        </div>

Being all of one mind, therefore, they attacked the king's camp by night; but he, foreseeing the storm that threatened him, had given notice to his soldiers to remove all their baggage, and to conceal themselves noiselessly in a neighbouring wood; and the camp was only saved because it was deserted. The Gauls, when they found it destitute not only of defenders, but of sentinels, suspecting that there was not a flight, but some stratagem on the part of the enemy, were for some time afraid to enter the gates. At last, leaving the defences entire and untouched, and more like men come to explore than to plunder, they took possession of the camp; and then, carrying off what they found, they directed their course towards the coast. Here, as they were incautiously plundering the vessels, and fearing no attack, they were cut down by the sailors, and a part of the army that had fled thither with their wives and children; and such was the slaughter among them that the report of this victory procured <a href=/people/31 target=_blank>Antigonus</a> peace, not only from the Gauls, but from his other barbarous neighbours. <br />The nation of the Gauls, however, was at that time so prolific, that they filled all Asia as with one swarm.

This embassy being disregarded, another arrived some time after, which, saying nothing on behalf of the orphan, ordered that 'the cities, which had fallen to the Roman people by the right of war, should be restored to their former condition.' On his refusal to comply with this mandate, war was declared against him, which he, after lightly undertaking it, prosecuted with ill success. <br />At the same time, the tyrant <a href=/people/404 target=_blank>Nabis</a> had taken possession of several cities of Greece.

This distrust ruined the mighty preparations for war, the skill of a leader being wanting to conduct it. The communication from the senate was, that .

Then, requesting indulgence for the freedom with which he was going to speak, he said, that 'he approved none of the present suggestions or proceedings; nor did he like Greece as a seat of the war, when <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was a far more advantageous field for it; for the Romans could not be conquered but by their own arms, nor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> subdued but by the resources of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>; since that people differed from others, and their mode of warfare from that of other nations.

If any one should attack them in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, therefore, he might conquer them with their own strength, their own resources, their own arms, as he himself had done; but if any one left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to them, which was the fountain-head, as it were, of their power, he would act just as absurdly, as a man who should attempt, not to exhaust rivers at their sources, but to alter their channels or dry them up when great floods of water had collected in them. He had entertained this,' he said, 'as his private opinion, and had readily offered his advice to that effect; and that he repeated it now, in the presence of his friends, that they might all understand the way to go to war with the Romans, who, though invincible abroad, might be reduced at home; for they might be deprived of their city sooner than of their empire, and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> sooner than of their provinces; since they had lost their city to the Gauls, and been almost crushed by him; nor was he ever defeated till he had quitted their country, but that, when he returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, the fortune of the war was immediately changed with the seat of it.' </p>                        </div>

All proceedings were therefore rendered ineffectual by the various flatteries of those who sought to please the king; nothing was conducted with judgment or reason. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> himself, resigning himself to luxury during the winter, was every day engaged in celebrating some new marriage. <a href=/people/584 target=_blank>Acilius</a> the Roman consul, on the other hand, who had been appointed to command in this war, provided forces, arms, and every thing necessary for the contest, with the utmost activity: he animated the confederate cities, and drew to his interest such as were undecided. Nor was the result of the conflict at variance with the preparations of each party for it; for, in the first engagement, when the king saw his men giving ground, he did not support those who were in distress, but put himself at the head of those that fled, and left his rich camp a prey to the conquerors. But having reached Asia in his flight, while the Romans were busied about the spoil, he began to repent of having neglected <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>'s counsel, and, taking that general again into his friendship, conducted every thing according to his directions. In the mean time intelligence was brought that <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a>, the Roman general, was approaching with eighty ships of war, having been despatched by the senate to carry on the war by sea. This news gave him hopes of retrieving his fortune; and accordingly he resolved to fight a battle by sea before any of the cities in alliance with him could revolt to the enemy, hoping that the defeat which he had suffered in Greece might be compensated by a new victory. The fleet was therefore entrusted to <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, and a battle was fought; but neither were the Asiatic soldiers a match for the Romans, nor their vessels equal to the beaked ships of the enemy.

The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a> were delighted that their descendants, after having conquered the west and Africa, were now laying claim to Asia as their hereditary domain, remarking that 'the ruin of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a> had been an event to be desired, since it was so happily to revive again.' On the other hand, an insatiable longing to gaze on their ancient home, the birth-place of their ancestors, and the temples and images of the gods, had taken possession of the Romans. <br />As the Romans were coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>, king <a href=/people/49 target=_blank>Eumenes</a> met them with some auxiliary troops; and soon after a battle was fought with <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>; in which one of the Roman legions, on the right wing, being beaten back, and fleeing to their camp with more disgrace than danger, Marcus <a href=/people/116 target=_blank>Aemilius</a>, a military tribune, who had been left to defend the camp, ordered his men to arm themselves, and advance without the rampart, and to threaten the fugitives with their swords drawn, saying that 'they should be put to death unless they returned to the field, and should find their own camp more hostile to them than that of the enemy.' The legion, alarmed at such peril on both sides, returned to the battle, their fellow soldiers, who had stopped their flight, accompanying them, and, making great havoc among the enemy, were the first cause of the victory. Fifty thousand of the enemy were slain, and eleven thousand taken prisoners. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> suing for peace, nothing was added to the former articles, <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> observing that 'the spirit of the Romans was never broken if they were defeated, and, if they were victorious, they were not rendered tyrannical by success.' The cities that were taken they divided among their allies, deeming that glory was more desirable for the Romans than dominions merely for pleasure; and that the honour of victory was worthy of being attached to the Roman name, but that the luxuries of wealth might be left to their adherents. </p>                        </div>

The circumstance, however, procured <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> no thanks for his embassy at home, but rather odium and detraction; for envy drew upon him hatred from his brother <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, and with his father, the cause of the indulgence shown him, as soon as he knew it, become a source of dislike towards him, as he was indignant that the character of his son should have had more weight with the senate than his own authority as a father or his dignity as a king. <a href=/people/65 target=_blank>Perseus</a>, in consequence, observing his father's chagrin, laid before him, day after day, accusations against <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> in his absence, and rendered him first an object of hatred, and afterwards of suspicion, charging him at one time with friendship for the Romans, and at another with treachery to his father.

Here, when he had long led a quiet life, but found himself envied for his great wealth, he deposited some urns, filled with lead, in the temple of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Diana</a>, as if thus to secure his treasure. The city, in consequence, being no longer concerned about him, as they supposed that they had his wealth in pledge, he betook himself to <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a>, putting his gold into some statues which he carried with him, lest his riches, if seen, should endanger his life. <a href=/people/319 target=_blank>Prusias</a> being subsequently defeated in a battle by land, and transferring the war to the sea, <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, by a new stratagem, was the cause of procuring him a victory; for he ordered <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a> of every kind to be enclosed in earthen pots, and to be thrown, in the hottest of the engagement, into the enemy's ships. This seemed at first ridiculous to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=demonym long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontic</a> soldiers, that the enemy should fight with earthen pots, as if they could not fight with the sword. But when the ships began to be filled with <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>, and they were thus involved in double peril, they yielded the victory to the enemy. <br />When the news of these transactions was brought to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, ambassadors were despatched by the senate to require the two kings to make peace, and demand the surrender of <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>. But <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, learning their object, took poison, and frustrated their embassy by his death. <br />This year was rendered remarkable by the deaths of the three greatest generals then in the world, <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>, <a href=/people/184 target=_blank>Philopoemen</a>, and <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio Africanus</a>.

Such, too, was his prudence in command, that though he had to rule armies of different nations, he was never annoyed by any conspiracy among his troops, or betrayed by their want of faith, though his enemies had often attempted to expose him to both. </p>                        </div>

But a prosperous family of ten sons made Israhel more famous than any of his ancestors. Having divided, his kingdom, in consequence, into ten governments, he committed them to his sons, and called the whole people <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> from <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a>, who died soon after the division, and ordered his memory to be held in veneration by them all, as his portion was shared among them. The youngest of the brothers was Joseph, whom the others, fearing his extraordinary abilities, secretly made prisoner, and sold to some foreign merchants. Being carried by them into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, and having there, by his great powers of mind, made himself master of the arts of magic, he found in a short time great favour with the king; for he was eminently skilled in prodigies, and was the first to establish the science of interpreting dreams; and nothing, indeed, of divine or human law seems to have been unknown to him; so that he foretold a dearth in the land some years before it happened, and all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> would have perished by famine, had not the king, by his advice, ordered the corn to be laid up for several years; such being the proofs of his knowledge, that his admonitions seemed to proceed, not from a mortal, but a god. His son was <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, whom, besides the inheritance of his father's knowledge, the comeliness of his person also recommended. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, being troubled with scabies and leprosy, and moved by some oracular prediction, expelled him, with those who had the disease, out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, that the distemper might not spread among a greater number. Becoming leader, accordingly, of the exiles, he carried off by stealth the sacred utensils of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, who, endeavouring to recover them by force of arms, were obliged by tempests to return home; and <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, having reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335363UDam class=place long=36.311 lat=33.509>Damascus</a>, the birth-place of his forefathers, took possession of mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/299339RSin class=place long=33.9 lat=29.9>Sinai</a>, on his arrival at which, after having suffered, together with his followers, from a seven days' fast in the deserts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a>, he consecrated every seventh day (according to the present custom of the nation) for a fast-day, and to be perpetually called a sabbath, because that day had ended at once their hunger and their wanderings.

After this atrocious outburst of rage, he assumed a mean dress, let his beard and hair grow like those of persons under legal prosecution, never went abroad or showed himself to the people, held no feasts in his palace, and behaved in no respect, indeed, like a man in his senses; so that he seemed to be paying penalty for his crimes to the manes of those whom he had murdered. Abandoning the government of his kingdom, too, he employed himself in digging and sowing in his garden, mixing noxious herbs with harmless ones, and sending them all indiscriminately, moistened with poisonous juices, as special presents to his friends. From this employment he turned to that of working in brass, and amused himself with modelling in wax, and casting and hammering out brazen figures.

Asia was assigned by the senate to the command of <a href=/people/11081 target=_blank>Licinius Crassus</a>, who, being more eager to plunder the treasures of <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a> than to distinguish himself in the field, and fighting a battle, at the end of the year, with his army in disorder, was defeated, and paid the penalty for his blind avarice by the loss of his life. The consul <a href=/people/3443 target=_blank>Perperna</a> being sent in his place, reduced <a href=/people/916 target=_blank>Aristonicus</a>, who was defeated in the first engagement, under his power, and carried off the treasures of <a href=/people/90 target=_blank>Attalus</a>, bequeathed to the Roman people, on ship-board to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

Nor was he afterwards more merciful to those of his subjects who had invited him to the throne, for license to use the sword being given to the foreign soldiers, all places daily ran with blood. He divorced his sister, too, offering violence to her daughter, a young maiden, and then taking her in marriage. The people, terrified at these proceedings, fled to other countries, and became exiles from their native soil through fear of death. <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a>, in consequence, being left alone with his soldiers in so large a city, and finding himself a king, not of men, but of empty houses, invited, by a proclamation, foreigners to become residents in it.

This deed occasioned grief and sorrow, not only to the queen, but also to the whole city, and threw such a gloom over a banquet intended to be most joyous, that the whole palace was suddenly filled with mourning.

But his preparations for luxury were not less than those for war, for three hundred thousand camp followers, of whom the greater number were cooks, bakers, and stage-players, attended on eighty thousand armed men. Of silver and gold, it is certain, there was such an abundance that the common soldiers fastened their buskins with gold, and trod upon the metal for the love of which nations contend with the sword. Their cooking instruments, too, were ot silver, as if they were going to a banquet, not to a field of battle. Many kings of the east met <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> on his march, offering him themselves and their kingdoms, and expressing the greatest detestation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> pride. Nor was there any delay in coming to an engagement. <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, being victorious in three battles, and having got possession of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, began to be thought a great man. All the neighbouring people, in consequence, joining him, nothing was left to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> but their own country. It was then that <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a> sent <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, with a body of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, to seize the throne, so that <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> might be recalled from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a> to secure his own dominions. In the meantime, since he could not overthrow <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> by open force, he made attempts upon him everywhere by stratagem. On account of the number of his forces, <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had distributed his army, in winter quarters, through several cities; and this dispersion was the cause of his ruin; for the cities, finding themselves harassed by having to furnish supplies, and by the depredations of the soldiers, revolted to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, and, on an appointed day, conspired to fall upon the army divided among them, so that the several divisions might not be able to assist each other. News of the attack being brought to <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, he hastened with that body of troops which he had in winter-quarters with him, to succour the others that lay nearest. On his way he was met by the king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, with whom he himself fought more bravely than his troops; but at last, as the enemy had the superiority in valour, he was deserted, through fear on the part of his men, and killed. <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a> had funeral rites performed for him as a king, and married the daughter of <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, whom <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> had brought with him, and of whom he had become enamoured. He then began to regret having sent away <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and hastily despatched some troops of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> to fetch him back; but they found that prince, who had been in fear of pursuit, already seated on his throne, and, after doing all they could to no purpose, returned to their king. </p>                        </div>

The name of <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> was given to the youth, and great succours were sent him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>.

Some days after, having ordered a golden statue of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> himself, of great weight, to be taken away secretly, and being caught in the sacrilegious act, he was forced to flee by a rising of the people, and being overtaken by a violent storm, and deserted by his men, he fell into the hands of robbers, and being brought before <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>, was put to death. <br /><a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>, having thus recovered his father's throne, and being freed from foreign perils, found his life endangered by a plot of his own mother; who, after betraying, from desire of power, her husband <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>, and putting to death her other son, was discontented at her dignity being eclipsed by the victory of <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>, and presented him with a cup of poison as he was returning home from taking exercise.

In addition to these obligations of relationship, he mentioned also the superstitious regard paid to the temple in which she had taken refuge, observing that 'the gods were so much the more religiously to be revered by him, as he had been the better enabled to conquer by their favour and protection; and that neither by killing her would he diminish the strength of <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a>, nor increase it by restoring her to him.'

Soon after <a href=/people/100 target=_blank>Cleopatra</a> expired, uttering imprecations on her unnatural murderers, and commending the avenging of her fate to the outraged deities. And not long after, another battle being fought, <a href=/people/1362 target=_blank>Cyzicenus</a>, being victorious, took <a href=/people/4737 target=_blank>Tryphaena</a>, the wife of <a href=/people/1346 target=_blank>Grypus</a>, who had just before killed her sister, prisoner, and by putting her to death made atonement to the manes of his wife. </p>                        </div>

Next to the royal authority is the order of the people, from which they take generals in war and magistrates in peace. Their language is something between those of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=ethnic long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed class=ethnic long=48 lat=35.5>Medes</a>, being a compound of both.

The fashion of their arms is that of their own country and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/475310RSky class=place long=31.01 lat=47.5>Scythia</a>. They have an army, not like other nations, of free men, but chiefly consisting of slaves, the numbers of whom daily increase, the power of manumission being allowed to none, and all their offspring, in consequence, being born slaves. These bondmen they bring up as carefully as their own children, and teach them, with great pains, the arts of riding and shooting with the bow. As any one is eminent in wealth, so he furnishes the king with a proportionate number of horsemen for war. Indeed when fifty thousand cavalry encountered <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, as he was making war upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, only four hundred of them were free men. <br />Of engaging with the enemy in close fight, and of taking cities by siege, they know nothing. They fight on horseback, either galloping forward or turning their backs. Often, too, they counterfeit flight, that they may throw their pursuers off their guard against being wounded by their arrows. The signal for battle among them is given, not by trumpet, but by drum. Nor are they able to fight long: but they would be irresistible, if their vigour and perseverance were equal to the fury of their onset. In general they retire before the enemy in the very heat of the engagement, and, soon after their retreat, return to the battle afresh; so that, when you feel most certain that you have conquered them, you have still to meet the greatest danger from them. Their armour, and that of their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, is formed of plates, lapping over one another like the feathers of a bird, and covers both man and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> entirely.

Indeed the difference between slaves and freemen is, that slaves go on foot, but freemen only on horseback. Their general mode of sepulture is dilaniation by birds or <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a>; the bare bones they at last bury in the ground. In their superstitions and worship of the gods, the principal veneration is paid to rivers. The disposition of the people is proud, quarrelsome, faithless, and insolent; for a certain roughness of behaviour they think becoming to men, and gentleness only to women. They are always restless, and ready for any commotion, at home or abroad; taciturn by nature; more ready to act than speak, and consequently shrouding both their successes and miscarriages in silence.

Not long after these occurrences the civil war among the Romans, between <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, broke out, in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> took the side of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, both from the friendship that they had formed with him in the <a href=/people/44 target=_blank>Mithridatic</a> war, and because of the death of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, whose son they understood to be of <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s party, and supposed that, if <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a> were victorious, he would avenge his father's fate. When <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s party was worsted, they sent assistance to <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> against <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Augustus</a> and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>; and, after the war was ended, they made an alliance with <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, and, under the leadership of <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>, again laid waste <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> and Asia, and assailed, with a vast force, the camp of <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>, who, like <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> before him, had routed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> army in the absence of <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>. <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>, pretending to be afraid, kept himself a long time in his camp, and suffered the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> to insult him. At last, however, when they were full of security and exultation, he sent out part of his legions upon them, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, put to flight by their onset, went off in several directions; when <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>, supposing that his fugitive troops had drawn off all the Roman forces in pursuit of them, attacked <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>'s camp, as if it had been left without defenders. Upon this, <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>, pouring forth the rest of his troops, put the whole force of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, with their king <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>, to the sword; nor did the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, in any war, ever suffer a greater slaughter. <br />When the news of this discomfiture reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a>, the father of <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>, who had just before heard that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> had been ravaged, and Asia occupied by his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, and was boasting of his son <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a> as the conqueror of the Romans, was affected, on hearing of the death of his son and the destruction of his army, at first with grief, and afterwards with disorder of the intellect. For several days he neither spoke to any one, nor took food, nor uttered a sound, so that he seemed to have become dumb. Some time after, when his sorrow found vent in words, he did nothing but call upon <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>; <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a> seemed to be seen and heard by him; <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a> appeared to talk with him, and stand by him; though at other times he mourned and wept for him as lost. After long indulgence in grief, another cause of concern troubled the unhappy old man, as he had to determine which of his thirty sons he should choose for his successor in the room of <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a>. His numerous concubines, from whom so large a progeny had sprung, were perpetually working on the old man's feelings, each anxious for her own offspring, But the fate of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>, in which it is now, as it were, customary that the princes should be assassins of their kindred; ordained that the most cruel of them all, <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a> by name should be fixed upon for their king. </p>                        </div>

On this prince <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> made war, with sixteen effective legions, for having sent troops against him and <a href=/people/108 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; but being severely harassed in several engagements, he was forced to retreat from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=place long=58.5 lat=37>Parthia</a>. <a href=/people/861 target=_blank>Phraates</a>, upon this success, becoming still more insolent, and being guilty of many fresh acts of cruelty, was driven into exile by his subjects.

He therefore briefly touches on the origin of the Roman empire, so as neither to exceed the bounds of the work that he had proposed, nor to pass unnoticed the origin of a city which is now the mistress of the world. <br />The first inhabitants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> were the Aborigines, whose king, <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a>, is said to have been a man of such extraordinary justice, that no one was a slave in his reign, or had any private property, but all things were common to all, and undivided, as one estate for the use of every one; in memory of which way of life, it has been ordered that at the <a href=/people/12227 target=_blank>Saturnalia</a> slaves should everywhere sit down with their masters at the entertainments, the rank of all being made equal. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> was accordingly called, from the name of that king, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/427115UAur class=place long=11.5048 lat=42.6662>Saturnia</a>; and the hill on which he dwelt Saturnius, on which now stands the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, as if <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Saturn</a> had been dislodged from his seat by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>. After him, third in descent, they say that <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> was king, in whose time <a href=/people/686 target=_blank>Evander</a> came into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> from <a href=/people/4640 target=_blank>Pallanteum</a>, a city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>, accompanied with a small band of his countrymen, to whom <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> kindly gave land, and the mountain which he afterwards called <a href=/people/3651 target=_blank>Palatium</a>. At the foot of this mountain he built a temple to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375220LLyk class=demonym long=21.975 lat=37.4569>Lycaean</a> god, whom the Greeks call <a href=/people/97 target=_blank>Pan</a>, and the Romans <a href=/people/7890 target=_blank>Lupercus</a>, the naked statue of the deity being covered with a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>-skin, in which dress the priests now run up and down during the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercalia</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. This <a href=/people/800 target=_blank>Faunus</a> had a wife named Fatua, who, being constantly filled with a spirit of divination, gave notice, in fits of frenzy as it were, of things to come; and hence, to this day, those who are accustomed to be thus inspired, are said fatuari.

After this event, they had to carry on war in concert against <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a>, king of the <a href=/people/1141 target=_blank>Rutulians</a>, because he had been disappointed of marrying <a href=/people/1059 target=_blank>Lavinia</a>; and in the war both <a href=/people/12087 target=_blank>Turnus</a> and <a href=/people/266 target=_blank>Latinus</a> were killed, <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>, in consequence, becoming by right of victory master of both nations, built a city which he called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417125ULav class=place long=12.4793 lat=41.6564>Lavinium</a>, from the name of his wife.

But <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>, having deprived <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>, who was the elder, of his share of the throne, condemned his daughter <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Rhea</a> to perpetual virginity, that no male offspring of <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>'s family might arise to claim the crown, palliating the injury by an appearance of honour, so that she might not seem to have been compelled, but to have been chosen one of the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>vestal virgins</a>. Being shut up, accordingly, in a grove sacred to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, she gave birth to two boys, whether the offspring of an illicit connexion with a mortal, or of the god <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, is uncertain. This affair becoming known, <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a>, whose fears were increased by the birth of twins, ordered the children to be exposed, and threw his niece into prison, of which ill-treatment she died. <a href=/people/2811 target=_blank>Fortune</a>, however, having a care for the raising of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, threw the children in the way of a she-<a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> to be suckled, which, having lost her cubs, and longing to empty her overcharged teats, offered herself as a nurse to the infants. As she made frequent returns to the children, as if they had been her own offspring, <a href=/people/12127 target=_blank>Faustulus</a>, a shepherd, observed her proceedings, and, withdrawing them from the beast, brought them up in a rude way of life among his <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>. That they were the sons of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, was believed, as on plain proof, either because they were born in the grove of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, or because they were nursed by a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, which is under the protection of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>. The names of the boys were <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a> and <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>. As they grew up among the shepherds, daily contests in strength increased their vigour and agility. While they were frequently engaged, with great activity, in preventing robbers from seizing the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, it happened that <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>, having been taken by the robbers, was brought before the king, as if he had himself been guilty of that which he was endeavouring to prevent in others, and had been accustomed to make depredations on <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>'s flocks.

In those times kings, instead of diadems, had spears, which the Greeks called sceptres; for the ancients, from the earliest period, worshipped spears as gods, and in memory of this superstition spears are still given to the statues of the gods. <br />In the time of King <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquin</a>, a company of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a> from Asia, sailing up the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, formed an alliance with the Romans, and proceeding from thence to the inmost part of the gulf of Gaul, built the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a> amidst the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=ethnic long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurians</a> and the savage Gallic tribes, and performed great exploits there, both in defending themselves against the fierce Gauls, and in attacking, of themselves, those by whom they had previously been molested. <br />The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387268UPho class=ethnic long=26.7532 lat=38.6704>Phocaeans</a>, compelled by the smallness and infertility of their territory, had applied themselves more to the sea than to the culture of the ground, supporting themselves by fishing, merchandise, and above all by <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>piracy</a>, which in those days was thought an honourable occupation. Venturing accordingly to visit the remotest shores of the ocean, they came into the gulf of Gaul and to the mouth of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a>; and, charmed with the pleasantness of the country, and relating, on their return home, what they had seen, they tempted others to go to the same parts. Of the fleet <a href=/people/1766 target=_blank>Simos</a> and <a href=/people/5934 target=_blank>Protis</a> were the captains, who applied to the king of the Segobrigii, named <a href=/people/8012 target=_blank>Nannus</a>, in whose territory they were anxious to build a city, desiring his friendship. On that day, as it happened, the king was engaged in preparing for the nuptials of his daughter Gyptis, whom, after the custom of that people, he intended to give in marriage to a son-in-law to be chosen at the feast. The suitors having been all invited to the wedding, the Grecian strangers were also requested to join the festival. The maiden was then introduced, and being desired by her father to give water to him whom she chose for her husband, she overlooked all the rest, and turning to the Greeks, held out water to <a href=/people/5934 target=_blank>Protis</a>, who, from the king's guest becoming his son-in-law, was presented by his father-in-law with the ground for building a city. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a> was accordingly built near the mouth of the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/437046WRho class=place long=4.5989 lat=43.6544>Rhone</a>, in a retired bay, and as it were in a corner of the sea. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=ethnic long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurians</a>, jealous of the growing greatness of the city, harassed the Greeks with continual war; but they, repelling their attacks, rose to such a degree of strength, that they conquered their enemies and planted several colonies in the lands which they captured. </p>                        </div>

Then too, they grew accustomed to live according to laws, and not by violence; then they learned to prune the vine and plant the olive; and such a radiance was shed over both men and things, that it was not Greece which seemed to have immigrated into Gaul, but Gaul that seemed to have been transplanted into Greece. <br />After <a href=/people/8012 target=_blank>Nannus</a>, king of the Segobrigii, from whom the ground for building the city had been received, was dead, and his son <a href=/people/5572 target=_blank>Comanus</a> had succeeded to the throne, a certain <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> told him that '<a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a> would one day be the ruin of the neighbouring people, and that he ought to suppress it in its rise, lest, when it grew stronger, it should overpower him.' To this prediction he added the following fable: 'A <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>bitch</a> once asked a shepherd, when she was big with young, for a place to bring forth her <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a>; having obtained it, she requested again that she might be allowed to bring them up in the same place; and at last, when her young were grown up, and she could depend upon their support, she claimed possession of the place as her own. In like manner,' he continued, 'the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>, who are now regarded as your tenants, will one day become masters of your territory.' Moved by these persuasions, the king formed a plan to overthrow <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>; in pursuance of which, on the day appointed for the feast of <a href=/people/12068 target=_blank>Flora</a>, he sent into the city several stout and able men. who were admitted as friends; an additional number he ordered to be conveyed concealed in wagons, covered over with baskets and boughs of trees; while he himself lay hid among the neighbouring hills, that after the gates had been opened in the night by the men before mentioned, he might come up in time to execute the plot, and might fall upon the city overcome with sleep and the fumes of wine. But a certain woman, a relative of the king, who had an intrigue with a Greek youth, revealed the plot to him, through compassion for his youth and beauty, during their intercourse, and bade him escape from the danger. He however reported the matter to the magistrates, and the treachery being thus made public, all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=ethnic long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurians</a> were seized, those concealed being dragged from among their baskets; and when they were all put to death, a plot was formed to surprise the plotter, and seven thousand of the enemy, with the king himself, were slain. Since that time the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=ethnic long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilians</a>, on festal days, have been accustomed to shut their gates, to keep watch, to place sentinels on the walls, to examine strangers, to take all kinds of precaution, and to guard the city as carefully in time of peace as if they were at war. Thus what was wisely instituted, is still observed, not from the necessity of circumstances, but from the habit of acting prudently. </p>                        </div>

It is less than either of these countries, but more fruitful than either; for it is neither scorched, like Africa, by a burning sun, nor disturbed, like Gaul, by incessant winds, but, being situate betwixt both, it is rendered, by moderate heat on the one hand, and genial and seasonable showers on the other, fertile in all kinds of fruits of the earth, so that it supplies abundance of everything, not only for its own inhabitants, but for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. From hence, indeed, comes not only great plenty of corn, but of wine, honey, and oil. Its iron is excellent, and its breed of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> swift. Not only is the produce of the surface to be admired, but the abundant riches of the metals hidden beneath it. There is great plenty, too, of flax and hemp, and certainly no country is more productive of vermilion. The courses of the rivers are not violent and rapid, so as to be hurtful, but gentle, watering the vineyards and the plains; they are also well stocked with fish from the estuaries of the sea, and most of them are rich in gold, which they carry down with their waters. It is joined to Gaul by one unbroken ridge of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a>; on every other side it is surrounded by sea. The shape of the country is almost square, except that it grows narrower towards the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a>, the shores contracting in that quarter. The length of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a> is six hundred miles. The salubrity of the air is the same through the whole of Spain, for its atmosphere is infected with no unwholesome mists from fens. Besides, there are constant breezes from the sea on every side, by which, as they penetrate the whole country, the exhalations from the earth are dispersed, and the greatest health is secured to the inhabitants. </p>                        </div>

His temperance and moderation were such, that though he often defeated armies commanded by consuls, yet, after such achievements, he made no change in the fashion of his dress or arms, or in his diet, but adhered to the same way of life with which he commenced his military career; so that any one of the common soldiers seemed better off than the general himself. </p>                        </div>

This prince, having a grandson born to him, the offspring of an intrigue on the part of his daughter, tried various means, through shame for her unchastity, to have the child put to death; but he, being preserved by some good fortune, through all calamities, came at last to the throne, from a compassionate feeling for the many perils that he had undergone. First of all he ordered him to be exposed, that he might be starved, and, when he sent some days after to look for his body, he was found nursed by the milk of various wild beasts. When he was brought home, he caused him to be thrown down in a narrow road, along which herds of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> used to pass; being so cruel that he would rather have his grandchild trampled to pieces, than despatched by an easy death.

By constantly following this nurse, the boy acquired extraordinary swiftness of foot, and long ranged the mountains and woods among herds of deer, with fleetness not inferior to theirs. At last, being caught in a snare, he was presented to the king; and then, from the similitude of his features, and certain marks which had been burnt on his body in his infancy, he was recognized as his grandson. Afterwards, from admiration at his escapes from so many mischances and perils, he was appointed by his grandfather to succeed him on the throne. The name given him was <a href=/people/9460 target=_blank>Habis</a>; and, as soon as he became king, he gave such proofs of greatness, that he seemed not to have been delivered in vain, through the power of the gods, from so many exposures to death. He united the barbarous people by laws; he was the first that taught them to break <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> for the plough, and to raise corn from tillage; and he obliged them, instead of food procured from the wilds, to adopt a better diet, perhaps through dislike of what he had eaten in his childhood. The adventures of this prince might seem fabulous, were not the founders of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> said to have been suckled by a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a>, and <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=ethnic long=54 lat=29.5>Persians</a>, to have been brought up by a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>. By him the people were interdicted from servile duties, and the commonalty were divided among seven cities. After <a href=/people/9460 target=_blank>Habis</a> was dead, the sovereignty was retained for many generations by his successors. <br />In another part of Spain, which consists of islands, the supreme power was in the hands of <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a>. Here there is such abundance of food for <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a>, that unless the feeding of the animals were occasionally interrupted, they would burst. Hence the herds of <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a>, which in those days were accounted the only species of wealth, were so renowned, that they tempted <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> out of Asia by the greatness of such a prize. <a href=/people/894 target=_blank>Geryon</a> himself, too, they say, was not a man with three bodies, as is told in fables, but that there were three brothers living in such unanimity, that they seemed all actuated by one soul; and that they did not attack <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> of their own accord, but, seeing their herds driven off, endeavoured to recover what they had lost by force of arms. </p>                        </div>

Subsequently, too, the success of their first attempt encouraging them, they sent their general <a href=/people/235 target=_blank>Hamilcar</a>, with a large army, to take possession of the whole country, who, having performed great exploits, but pursuing his fortune too rashly, was drawn into an ambush and killed.
