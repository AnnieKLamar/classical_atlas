                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.1.5'><b>&sect; Att.1.5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I (Att. I, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME We are such intimate friends that more than almost anyone else you can appreciate the grief as well as the actual public and private loss that the death of my cousin Lucius is to me. There is absolutely no gratification which any human being can receive from the kindly character of another that I have not been accustomed to receive from him. I am sure, therefore, that you will share my grief. For, in the first place, whatever affects me affects you; and in the second place, you have yourself lost in him a friend and connexion of the highest character and most obliging disposition, who was attached to you from personal inclination, as well as from my conversation. As to what you say in your letter about your sister, she will herself bear me witness what pains I have taken that my brother Quintus should show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat inclined to be angry with her, I wrote to him in such a way as I thought would not hurt his feelings as a brother, while giving him some good advice as my junior, and remonstrating with him as being in the wrong. The result is that, from frequent letters since received from him, I feel confident that everything is as it ought and as we should wish it to be. As to the frequency of my letters you have no ground for your complaint. The fact is our good sister <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a> never informed me of there being a courier ready to take a letter. Farthermore, I never chanced to know of anyone going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, and I was not till recently informed of your being at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>. Again, as to the business of <a href=/people/6165 target=_blank>Acutilius</a> which you had left in my hands. I had settled it on my first visit to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after your departure. But it turned out that, in the first place, there was no urgency in the matter, and, in the second place, as I felt confidence in your judgment, I preferred that <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a> rather than myself should advise you by letter on the subject. For having submitted my ears to <a href=/people/6165 target=_blank>Acutilius</a> for several days (and I think you know his style), I should scarcely have regarded it as a hardship to write you a letter describing his grumblings after patiently enduring the bore (and it was rather a bore, I can tell you) of hearing them. Moreover, though you find fault with me, allow me to observe that I have had only one letter from you, though you had greater leisure for writing, and more opportunity of sending letters. As to what you say in your letter, Even if anyone is inclined to be offended with you, I ought to bring him to a better mind  — I understand to what you allude, and I have not neglected the matter. But the truth is that the extent of his displeasure is something surprising. However, I have not omitted to say anything there was to say in your behalf: but on what points I am to hold out your wishes, I consider, ought to be my guide. If you will write me word distinctly what they are, you will find that I have had no desire to be more exacting, and in the future shall be no more yielding, than you wish. As to the business of <a href=/people/3084 target=_blank>Tadius</a>. He tells me that you have written him word that there was no need of farther trouble, since the property is secured by prescription. I am surprised that you do not know that in the case of a statutory wardship of an unmarried girl prescription cannot be pleaded. I am glad you like your purchase in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. What I commissioned you to get for me, and anything you see suitable to my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa, I should be glad if you will, as you say in your letter, procure for me, only don't put yourself to any inconvenience. The truth is, there is no other place that gives me complete rest after all my worries and hard work. I am expecting my brother Quintus every day. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> has a severe attack of rheumatism. She is devoted to you, to your sister, and your mother, and adds her kindest regards in a postscript. So does my pet <a href=/people/2948 target=_blank>Tulliola</a>. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> me, and be assured that I love you as a brother. </p>                        </div>

I wished you to know this in case you were still hankering after it. We may be quite satisfied, I think, with my brother's feelings towards <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a> He is with her at present in his villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, and has <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> Turanius with him, who is great in belles lettres. The date of my father's death was the 28th of November. That is about all my news. If you light on any articles of vertu suitable for a gymnasium, which would look well in the place you know of; please don't let them slip. I am so delighted with my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa that I never feel really happy till I get there.

For instance, it is owing to this uncertainty on my part that this very letter is somewhat short, because not being sure as to where you are, I don't choose my confidential talk to fall into strange hands. The Megaric statues and the Hermae, which you mentioned in your letters, I am waiting for impatiently. Anything you have of the same kind which may strike you as worthy of my Academia, do not hesitate to send, and have complete confidence in my money-chest. My present delight is to pick up anything particularly suitable to a gymnasium. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> promises the use of his ships. I beg you to be zealous in these matters. <a href=/people/8423 target=_blank>Thyillus</a> begs you (and I also at his request) to get him some writings of the <a href=/people/1941 target=_blank>Eumolpidae</a>. </p>                        </div>

Your mother and sister are regarded with affection by me and my brother Quintus. I have spoken to <a href=/people/6165 target=_blank>Acutilius</a>. He says that he has not heard from his agent, and professes surprise that you should make any difficulty of his having refused to guarantee you against farther demands. As to the business of <a href=/people/3084 target=_blank>Tadius</a>, the announcement in your letter that you have settled the matter Out of court I saw gratified and pleased him very much. That friend of mine — a most excellent man, upon my honour, and most warmly attached to me — is very angry with you. If I could but know how much you care about it, I should be able to decide how much trouble I am to take in the matter. I have paid L. <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> the 20,400 sesterces written for the Megaric statues in accordance with your letter to me. As to your Hermae of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381239LPen class=demonym long=23.8831 lat=38.0807>Pentelic</a> marble with bronze heads, about which you wrote to me — I have fallen in love with them on the spot. So pray send both them and the statues, and anything else that may appear to you to suit the place you know of, my passion, and your taste — as large a supply and as early as possible. Above all, anything you think appropriate to a gymnasium and terrace. I have such a passion for things of this sort that while I expect assistance from you, I must expect something like rebuke from others. If <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> has no vessel there, put them on board anyone you please.

The result is that, though I do send an answer, I am forced by the shortness of the time to write only these few words. First, as to softening my friend's feeling towards you, or even reconciling him outright, I pledge you my word to do so. Though I have been attempting it already on my own account, I will now urge the point more earnestly and press him closer, as I think I gather from your letter that you are so set upon it. This much I should like you to realize, that he is very deeply offended; but since I cannot see any serious ground for it, I feel confident that he will do as I wish and yield to my influence. As for my statues and Hermeracles, pray put them on board, as you say in your letter, at your very earliest convenience, and anything else you light upon that may seem to you appropriate to the place you know of, especially anything you think suitable to a palaestra and gymnasium. I say this because I am sitting there as I write. so that the very place itself reminds me. Besides these, I commission you to get me some medallions to let into the walls of my little entrance-court, and two engraved stone-curbs. Mind you don't engage your library to anyone, however keen a lover you may find; for I am hoarding up my little savings expressly to secure that resource for my old age. As to my brother, I trust that all is as I have ever wished and tried to make it. There are many signs of that result — not least that your sister is enceinte. As for my election, I don't forget that I left the question entirely to you, and I have all along been telling our common friends that I have not only not asked you to come, but have positively forbidden you to do so, because I understood that it was much more important to you to carry through the business you have now in hand, than it is to me to have you at my election. I wish you therefore to feel as though you had been sent to where you are in my interests. Nay, you will find me feeling towards you, and hear of it from others, exactly as though my success were obtained not only in your presence, but by your direct agency. <a href=/people/2948 target=_blank>Tulliola</a> gives notice of action against you.

Besides, <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> has been always at my side to prompt me to spare no pains to induce <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> to be reconciled to you. But after doing everything that could be done, not only did I fail to renew his old feelings towards you, but I could not even succeed in eliciting the reason of his alienation. On his part, however, he keeps harping on that arbitration case of his, and the other matters which I knew very well before you left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> were causing him offence. Still, he has certainly got something else fixed deeper in his mind; and this no letters from you, and no commissioning of me will obliterate as easily as you will do in a personal interview, I don't mean merely by your words, but by the old familiar expression of your face — if only you think it worth while, as you will if you will listen to me, and be willing to act with your habitual kindness. Finally, you need not wonder why it is that, whereas I intimated in my letters that I felt hopeful of his yielding to my influence, I now appear to have no such confidence; for you can scarcely believe how much more stubborn his sentiment appears to me than I expected, and how much more obstinate he is in this anger. However, all this will either be cured when you come, or will only be painful to the party in fault. As to the sentence in your letter, you suppose by this time I am praetor-elect, let me tell you that there is no class of people at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> so harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for office; and that no one knows when the elections will be.

I am surprisingly delighted with the mere thought of that place, to say nothing of its actual occupation. Mind also not to let anyone else have your books.

I, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME, JULY: The state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that you are supremely interested, is this, as far as can be as yet conjectured. The only person actually canvassing is P. <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>. He meets with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or disguise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason for their refusal that they are under obligations to me. So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about that my friends are found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my own canvass just at the very time that <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> tells me that your servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus at the time of the tribunician elections on the 17th of July. My fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem certain, are <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a> and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> and Q. <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a>. At this I imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make you positively smite your forehead, there are people who actually think that <a href=/people/6313 target=_blank>Caesonius</a> will stand. I don't think <a href=/people/1693 target=_blank>Aquilius</a> will, for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar. <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon. As for <a href=/people/2293 target=_blank>Aufidius</a> and <a href=/people/8088 target=_blank>Palicanus</a>, I don't think you will expect to hear from me about them. Of the candidates for this year's election <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is considered certain. <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a> is looked upon as the rival of <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a>. These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems pas impossible to bring in <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> over their heads. But no one else thinks so. What seems most to my interests is that <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a> should get in with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact that he is Commissioner of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPFl class=place long=12.4759 lat=41.9115>via Flaminia</a>, and when that has been finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected consul this election. Such in outline is the position of affairs in regard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill I shall obtain a libera legatio and make an excursion in the course of September to visit <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, but so as not to be back later than January. When I have ascertained the feelings of the nobility I will write you word. Everything else I hope will go smoothly, at any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town. You must undertake to secure for me the entourage of our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, since you are nearer than I. Tell him I shall not be annoyed if he doesn't come to my election. So much for that business. But there is a matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me. Your uncle <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P. <a href=/people/2267 target=_blank>Varius</a>, began an action against his cousin A. <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> for the property which (as he alleged) the latter had received from <a href=/people/2267 target=_blank>Varius</a> by a collusive sale. He was joined in this action by the other creditors, among whom were <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> and P. <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, and the man whom they thought would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a>; though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this stage in the proceedings. <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> asked me to appear for him against satyrus. Now, scarcely a day passes that <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> does not call at my house. The chief object of his attentions is L <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, but I am next in his regard. He has been of great service both to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much embarrassed by my intimacy with <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a> as well as that with <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, on whom the success of my election depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these facts to <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>; at the same time I assured him that if the case had been one exclusively between himself and <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a>, I would have done what he wished. As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being concerned — and that too men of the highest rank, who without the aid of anyone specially retained by <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, would have no difficulty in maintaining their common cause — it was only fair that he should have consideration both for my private friendship and my present situation. He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have wished or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth 'he has entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me, which was only of a few day's standing. Pray forgive me, and believe that I was prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress, considering that he had shown me every sort of kindness and attention. But if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the interests of my canvass prevented me. Yet, even granting that to be so, I think you should pardon me, since not for sacred beast or oxhide shield. You see in fact the position I am in and how necessary I regard it, not only to retain but even 'to acquire all possible sources of popularity. I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any rate anxious to have done so. The <a href=/people/9498 target=_blank>Hermathena</a> you sent I am delighted with: it has been placed with such Charming effect that the whole gymnasium seems arranged speclally for it. I am exceedingly obliged to you. </p>                        </div>

But to return to my first remark: I never saw anything more shameless, artful, and dilatory. I am on the point of sending my freedman, I have commissioned Titus — excuses and delays at every turn! But perhaps it is a case of l'homme propose, for <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s advance couriers tell me that he means to move in the senate that a successor to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> ought to be named, and the praetor intends to bring the proposal before the people at the same time. The facts are such that I cannot defend him in view of the opinion either of the aristocrats or the people, and, what is more than anything else, that I have no wish to do so. For a thing has happened into the truth of which I charge you to look thoroughly. I have a freedman, who is a worthless fellow enough; I mean <a href=/people/4557 target=_blank>Hilarus</a>, an accountant and a client of your own. The interpreter <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> gives me this information about him, and <a href=/people/8423 target=_blank>Thyillus</a> writes me word that he has been told the same story: that the fellow is with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, and that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, in exacting money payments, frequently remarks that a part is being collected for me, and that I have sent a freedman to look after our common interests. I felt exceedingly disturbed, and yet could not believe it; but at any rate there has been some gossip of the sort. Pray look into the whole matter, learn the truth, find out the author, and get the empty-headed idiot out of the Country, if you possibly can. <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> mentions Cn. <a href=/people/3070 target=_blank>Plancius</a> as the origin of this gossip.

I feel sure you will be sorry for it. I have nothing else to tell you. And, indeed, at the moment of writing, I am in considerable distress: for a delightful youth, my reader <a href=/people/2547 target=_blank>Sosthenes</a>, has just died, and his death has affected me more than that of a slave should, I think, do.

I, 13) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 27 JANUARY: I have now received three letters from you — one by the hands of M. <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a>, which you gave him, I think, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416129UTTa class=place long=12.8711 lat=41.5647>Three Taverns</a>; a second which your host at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> delivered to me; a third dated, according to you, from on board your pinnace, when the cable was already slipped. They were all three, to use a phrase from the schools of rhetoric flavoured with the salt of learning, and illumined with the marks of affection. In these letters, indeed, I am urgently pressed by you to send answers, but what renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the difficulty of finding a trustworthy carrier. How few of these gentry are able to convey a letter rather weightier than usual without lightening it by skimming its contents! Besides, I do not always care to send whenever anyone is starting for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>: for I suppose that, having offered victims before your <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amaltheia</a>, you at once started for the siege of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a>. And yet I am not even certain when you start to visit <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> or how much time you are devoting to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. Accordingly, I don't venture to trust either <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=ethnic long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirotes</a> with a letter somewhat more outspoken than usual. Now some events have occurred since you left me worth my writing to you, but they must not be trusted to the risk of a letter being lost, opened, or intercepted. Well, then, to begin with: I was not called upon to speak first, and the pacifier of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a> was preferred to me, and though this met with some murmurs of disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it was done. For I am thereby freed from any obligation to show respect to an ill-conditioned man, and am at liberty to support my position in the Republic in spite of him. Besides, the second place has a dignity almost equal to that of princeps senatus, and does not put one under too much of an obligation to the consul. The third called on was <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>; the fourth, if you want to go still farther, <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. The consul himself is a man of a small and ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon of that splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the absence of wit: it is his face rather than his facetiousness that causes merriment: he takes practically no part in public business, and is quite alienated from the Optimates. You need expect no service to the state from him, for he has not the will to do any, nor fear any damage, for he hasn't the courage to inflict it. His colleague, however, treats me with great distinction, and is also a zealous supporter of the loyalist party. For the present their disagreement has not come to much; but I fear that this taint may spread farther. For I suppose you have heard that when the state function was being performed in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s house a man in woman's dress got in, and that the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestals</a> having performed the rite again, mention was made of the matter in the senate by Q. <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a> — he was the first, so don't think that it was one of us consulars — and that on the matter being referred by a decree of the senate to the [Virgins and] pontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had been committed: that then, on a farther decree of the senate, the consuls published a bill: and that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> divorced his wife. On this question <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, from friendship for P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, is doing his best to get the bill promulgated by himself (though in accordance with a decree of the senate and on a point of religion) rejected. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> as yet is strongly for severe measures. The loyalists hold aloof owing to the entreaties of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>: bands of ruffians are being got together: I myself, at first a stern <a href=/people/78 target=_blank>Lycurgus</a>, am becoming daily less and less keen about it: <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is hot and eager. In short, I fear that between the indifference of the loyalists and the support of the disloyal it may be the cause of great evils to the Republic. However, your great friend — do you know whom I mean? — of whom you said in your letter that, not venturing to blame me, he was beginning to be complimentary, is now to all appearance exceedingly fond of me, embraces me, loves and praises me in public, while in secret (though unable to disguise it) he is jealous of me. No good-breeding, no straightforwardness, no political morality, no distinction, no courage, no liberality! But on these points I will write to you more minutely at another time; for in the first place I am not yet quite sure about them, and in the next place I dare not entrust a letter on such weighty matters to such a casual nobody's son as this messenger. The praetors have not yet drawn their lots for the provinces. The matter remains just where you left it. The description of the scenery of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> which you ask for I will include in my speech. I had already noticed the mistake in the date, 3rd of December. The points in my speeches which you praise, believe me, I liked very much myself, but did not venture to say so before. Now, however, as they have received your approval, I think them much more Attic than ever. To the speech in answer to <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>. I have made some additions. The book shall be sent you, since affection for me gives you a taste for rhetoric. What news have I for you? Let me see. Oh, yes! The consul <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> has bought <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>'s house for 3,400 sestertia. What is that to me? you will say. Why, thus much. The price has convinced people that I made no bad bargain, and they begin to understand that in making a purchase a man may properly use his friends' means to get what suits his position. The <a href=/people/2670 target=_blank>Teucris</a> affair drags on, yet I have hopes. Pray settle the business you have in hand. You shall have a more outspoken letter soon. </p>                        </div>

I, 14) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 13 FEBRUARY: I fear it may seem affectation to tell you how occupied I have been; but I am so distracted with business that I have only just found time for this short letter, and that has been stolen from the most urgent engagements. I have already described to you <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s first public speech — it did not please the poor, nor satisfy the disloyal, nor find favour with the wealthy, nor appear sound to the loyalists; accordingly, he is down in the world. Presently, on the instigation of the consul <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, that most insignificant of tribunes, <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a>, brought <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> on to the platform. The meeting was in the circus <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a>, and there was in the same place that day a crowd of market people — a kind of tiers etat. He asked him to say whether he approved of the jurymen being selected by the praetor, to form a panel for the praetor himself to employ. That was the regulation made by the senate in the matter of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s sacrilege. Thereupon <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> made a highly aristocratic speech, and replied (and at great length) that in all matters the authority of the senate was of the greatest weight in his eyes and had always been so. Later on the consul <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> in the senate asked <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> his opinion as to the sacrilege and the bill that had been published. His speech in the senate amounted to a general commendation of all decrees of the house, and when he sat down he said to me, I think my answer covers your case also. When <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> observed that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had got a cheer from the idea in men's minds that he approved my consulship, he rose also to. his feet and delivered a speech in the most complimentary terms on my consulship, going so far as to say that he owed it to me that he was still a senator, a citizen, nay, a free man; and that he never beheld wife, home, or country without beholding the fruits of my conduct. In short: that whole topic, which I am wont to paint in various colours in my speeches (of which you are the <a href=/people/340 target=_blank>Aristarchus</a>), the fire, the sword — you know my paint-pots — he elaborated to the highest pitch. I was sitting next to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. I noticed that he was agitated, either at <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> earning the gratitude which he had himself neglected, or to think that my achievements were, after all, of such magnitude that the senate was so glad to hear them praised, especially by a man who was the less under an obligation to praise me, because in everything I ever wrote my praise of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was practically a reflection on him. This day has brought me very close to <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, and yet in spite of all I accepted with pleasure any compliment — open or covert — from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. But as for my own speech, good heavens! how I did put it on for the benefit of my new auditor <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>! If I ever did bring every art into play, I did then — period, transition, enthymeme, deduction — everything. In short, I was cheered to the echo. For the subject of my speech was the dignity of the senate, its harmony with the equites, the unanimity of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, the dying embers of the conspiracy, the fall in prices, the establishment of peace. You know my thunder when these are my themes. It was so loud, in fact, that I may cut short my description, as I think you must have heard it even in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. The state of things at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is this: the senate is a perfect <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a>. You cannot conceive anything firmer, more grave, or more high-spirited. For when the day came for proposing the bill in accordance with the vote of the senate, a crowd of our dandies with their chin-tufts assembled, all the <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> set, with <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s girlish son at their head, and implored the people to reject it. Moreover, <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> the consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke against it. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s hired ruffians had filled up the entrances to the voting boxes. The voting tickets were so manipulated that no ayes were distributed. Hereupon imagine <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> hurrying to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, delivering an admirable invective against the consul, if we can call that an invective which was really a speech of the utmost weight and authority, and in fact containing the most salutary advice. He is followed to the same effect by your friend <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, and many loyalists besides, among whom, however, the contribution of <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> was conspicuous. By this rally of the Optimates the comitia is dissolved, the senate summoned. On the question being put in a full house — in spite of the opposition of <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, and in spite of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> throwing himself at the feet of the senators one after the other — that the consuls should exhort the people to pass the bill, about fifteen voted with <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, who was against any decree being passed; on the other side there were fully four hundred. So the vote passed. The tribune <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> then gave in. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in which he bestowed some injurious epithets on <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, C. <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, and the consul <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>; me he only charged with having discovered everything. In regard to the assignation of provinces to the praetors, the hearing legations, and other business, the senate voted that nothing should be brought before it till the bill had been brought before the people. There is the state of things at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for you. Yet pray listen to this one thing more which has surpassed my hopes. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> is a superlatively good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he praises, shows attachment to, and imitates me. That other one (<a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>) is the less mischievous because of one vice — he is lazy, sleepy, unbusinesslike, an utter faineant, but in intention he is so disaffected that he has begun to loathe <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> since he made the speech in which some praise was bestowed on the senate. Accordingly, he has alienated all the loyalists to a remarkable degree. And his action is not dictated by love for <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> more than by a taste for a profligate policy and a profligate party. But he has nobody among the magistrates like himself, with the single exception of the tribune <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a>. The tribunes are excellent, and in <a href=/people/1444 target=_blank>Cornutus</a> we have a quasi-<a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. Can I say more? Now to return to private matters. <a href=/people/2670 target=_blank>Teucris</a> has fulfilled her promise. Pray execute the commission you undertook. My brother Quintus, who purchased the remaining three-fourths of the house in the <a href=/people/4077 target=_blank>Argiletum</a> for 725 sestertia, is now trying to sell his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> property, in order to purchase, if he can, the town house of <a href=/people/8084 target=_blank>Pacilius</a>. Make it up with <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>! I see that he is all agog to stand for the consulship. I will do my best. Be careful to let me know exactly how you are, where you are, and how your business goes on. 13 February. </p>                        </div>

I, 16) TO ATTICUS ROME (MAY) You ask me what has happened about the trial, the result of which was so contrary to the general expectation, and at the same time you want to know how I came to make a worse fight of it than usual. I will answer the last first. after the manner of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>. The fact is that, so long as I had to defend the authority of the senate, I battled with such gallantry and vigour that there were shouts of applause and crowds round me in the house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever thought that I showed courage in political business, you certainly would have admired my conduct in that cause. For when the culprit had betaken himself to public meetings, and had made an invidious use of my name, immortal gods! What battles! What havoc! What sallies I made upon <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, on the whole of that set! How I fell upon the old men for their instability, on the young for their profligacy! Again and again, so help me heaven! I regretted your absence not only as the supporter of my policy, but as the spectator also of my admirable fighting. However, when <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> hit on the idea of a law as to the sacrilege being proposed by the tribune <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a>, in which there was no difference from the bill of the consul except as to the kind of jurymen — on that point, however, the whole question turned — and got it carried by sheer fighting, because he had persuaded himself and others that he could not get an acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew in my sails, seeing the neediness of the jurors, and gave no evidence beyond what was so notorious and well attested that I could not omit it. Therefore, if you ask reason of the acquittal — to return at length to the former of the two questions — it was entirely the poverty and low character of the jury. But that this was possible was entirely the result of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>'s policy. In his alarm lest <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> should veto the law which was to be proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he failed to see that it was better that the culprit should be left under a cloud of disgrace and dishonour than that he should be trusted to the discretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate resentment he hastened to bring the case into court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough to cut his throat. But if you want to know the history of the trial, with its incredible verdict, it was such that <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>'s policy is now blamed by other people after the event, though I disapproved of it from the first. When the rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst loud cheers and counter-cheers — the accuser like a strict censor rejecting the most worthless, the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators all the best — as soon as the jury had taken their seats, the loyalists at once began to feel distrust. There never was a seedier lot round a table in a gambling hell. Senators under a cloud, equites out at elbows, tribunes who were not so much made of money as collectors of it, according to their official title. However, there were a few honest men in the panel, whom he had been unable to drive off it by rejection, and they took their seats among their uncongenial comrades with gloomy looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly disgusted at having to rub elbows with such rascals. Hereupon, as question after question was referred to the panel in the preliminary proceedings, the severity of the decisions passes belief: there was no disagreement in voting, the defendant carried none of his points, while the accuser got even more than he asked. He was triumphant. Need I say more? <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> would have it that he was the only one of us who had seen the truth. There was not a man who did not think it impossible for him to stand his trial without being condemned a thousand times over. Further, when I was produced as a witness, I suppose you have been told how the shouts of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s supporters were answered by the jury rising to their feet to gather round me, and openly to offer their throats to P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> in my defence. This seemed to me a greater compliment than the well-known occasion when your fellow citizens stopped <a href=/people/365 target=_blank>Xenocrates</a> from taking an oath in the witness-box, or when, upon the accounts of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> <a href=/people/3436 target=_blank>Numidicus</a> being as usual handed round, a Roman jury refused to look at them. The compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater. Accordingly, as the jurymen were protecting me as the mainstay of the country, it was by their voices that the defendant was overwhelmed, and with him all his advocates suffered a crushing blow. Next day my house was visited by as great a throng as that which escorted me home when I laid down the consulship. Our eminent <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagites</a> then exclaimed that they would not come into court unless a guard was assigned them. The question was put to the whole panel: there was only one vote against the need of a guard. The question is brought before the senate: the decree is passed in the most solemn and laudatory terms: the jurymen are complimented: the magistrates are commissioned to carry it out: no one thought that the fellow would venture on a defence. Tell me, ye <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>, now how first the fire befell ! You know Bald-head, the Nanneian millionaire, that panegyrist of mine, whose complimentary oration I have already mentioned to you in a letter. In two days' time, by the agency of a single slave, and one, too, from a school of gladiators, he settled the whole business — he summoned them to an interview, made a promise, offered security, paid money down. Still farther, good heavens, what a scandal! even favours from certain ladies, and introductions to young men of rank, were thrown in as a kind of pourboire to some of the jurors. Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely aloof, with the forum full of slaves, twenty-five jurors were yet found so courageous that, though at the risk of their lives, they preferred even death to producing universal ruin. There were thirty-one who were more influenced by famine than fame. On seeing one of these latter <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> said to him, Why did you ask us for a guard? Did you fear being robbed of the money? There you have, as briefly as I could put it, the nature of the trial and the cause of the acquittal. Next you want to know the present state of public affairs and of my own. That settlement of the Republic — firmly established by my wisdom, as you thought, as I thought by God's — which seemed fixed on a sure foundation by the unanimity of all loyalists and the influence of my consulship — that I assure you, unless some God take compassion on us, has by this one verdict escaped from our grasp: if verdict it is to be called, when thirty of the most worthless and dissolute fellows in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for a paltry sum of money obliterate every principle of law and justice, and when that which every man — I had almost said every animal — knows to have taken place, a <a href=/people/3974 target=_blank>Thalna</a>, a <a href=/people/408 target=_blank>Plautus</a>, and a Spongia, and other scum of that sort decide not to have taken place. However, to console you as to the state of the Republic, rascaldom is not as cheerful and exultant in its victory as the disloyal hoped after the infliction of such a wound upon the Republic. For they fully expected that when religion, morality, the honour of juries, and the prestige of the senate had sustained such a crushing fall, victorious profligacy and lawless lust would openly exact vengeance from all the best men for the mortification which the strictness of my consulship had branded in upon all the worst. And it is once more I — for I do not feel as if I were boasting vaingloriously when speaking of myself to you, especially in a letter not intended to be read by others — it was I once more, I say, who revived the fainting spirits of the loyalists, cheering and encouraging each personally. Moreover, by my denunciations and invectives against those corrupt jurors I left none of the favourers and supporters of that victory a word to say for themselves. I gave the consul <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> no rest anywhere, I got him deprived of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, which had been already plighted to him, I revived the fainting spirit of the senate and recalled it to its former severity. I overwhelmed <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> in the senate to his face, both in a set speech, very weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of repartees, of which I append a specimen for your delectation. The rest lose all point and grace without the excitement of the contest, or, as you Greeks call it, the ἀγών. Well, at the meeting of the senate on the 15th of May, being called on for my opinion, I spoke at considerable length on the high interests of the Republic, and brought in the following passage by a happy inspiration: Do not, Fathers, regard yourselves as fallen utterly, do not faint, because you have received one blow. The wound is one which I cannot disguise, but which I yet feel sure should not be regarded with extreme fear: to fear would show us to be the greatest of cowards, to ignore it the greatest of fools. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> was twice acquitted, so was <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a>, a third such criminal has now been let loose by jurors upon the Republic. You are mistaken, <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>: it is not for the city but for the prison that the jurors have reserved you, and their intention was not to retain you in the state, but to deprive you of the privilege of exile. Wherefore, Fathers, rouse up all your courage, hold fast to your high calling. There still remains in the Republic the old unanimity of the loyalists: their feelings have been outraged, their resolution has not been weakened: no fresh mischief has been done, only what was actually existing has been discovered. In the trial of one profligate many like him have been detected. — But what am I about? I have copied almost a speech into a letter. I return to the duel of words. Up gets our dandified young gentleman, and throws in my teeth my having been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a>. It wasn't true, but what did that matter to him? It is as though you were to say, replied I, that I had been in disguise! What business, quoth he, has an <a href=/people/8884 target=_blank>Arpinate</a> with hot baths? Say that to your patron, said I, who Coveted the watering-place of an <a href=/people/8884 target=_blank>Arpinate</a>. For you know about the marine villa. How long, said he, are we to put up with this king? Do you mention a king, quoth I, when Rex made no mention of you? He, you know, had swallowed the inheritance of Rex in anticipation. You have bought a house, says he. You would think that he said, quoth I, you have bought a jury. They didn't trust you on your oath, said he. Yes, said I, twenty-five jurors did trust me, thirty-one didn't trust you, for they took care to get their money beforehand. Here he was overpowered by a burst of applause and broke down without a word to say. My own position is this: with the loyalists I hold the same place as when you left town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a> I hold a much better one than at your departure. For it does me no harm that my evidence appears not to have availed. <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Envy</a> has been let blood without causing pain, and even more so from the fact that all the supporters of that flagitious proceeding confess that a perfectly notorious fact has been hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the wretched starveling mob, the blood-sucker of the treasury, imagines me to be high in the favour of <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> — and indeed we have been mutually united by frequent pleasant intercourse to such an extent, that our friends the boon companions of the conspiracy, the young chin-tufts, speak of him in ordinary conversation as Gnaeus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. Accordingly, both in the circus and at the gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable ovation without a single <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cat</a>-call. There is at present a lively anticipation of the elections, in which, contrary to everybody's wishes, our friend <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> is pushing the claims of <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a>'s son; and in that matter his weapons are neither his prestige nor his popularity, but those by which <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a> said that any fortress could be taken — if only an ass laden with gold could make its way up into it. Furthermore, that precious consul, playing as it were second fiddle to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, is said to have undertaken the business and to have bribery agents at his house, which I don't believe. But two decrees have already passed the house of an unpopular character, because they are thought to be directed against the consul on the demand of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> — one that search should be allowed in magistrates' houses, and a second, that all who had bribery agents in their houses were guilty of treason. The tribune <a href=/people/7893 target=_blank>Lurco</a> also, having entered on his office irregularly in view of the <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> law, has been relieved from the provisions both of the <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> and Fufian laws, in order to enable him to propose his law on bribery, which he promulgated with correct auspices though a cripple. Accordingly, the comitia have been postponed to the 27th of July. There is this novelty in his bill, that a man who has promised money among the tribes, but not paid it, is not liable, but, if he has paid, he is liable for life to pay 3,000 sesterces to each tribe. I remarked that P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> had obeyed this law by anticipation, for he was accustomed to promise, and not pay. But observe! Don't you see that the consulship of which we thought so much, which <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> used of old to call an apotheosis, if this <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> is elected, will become a mere farce and mockery? Therefore I think one should play the philosopher, as you in fact do, and not care a straw for your consulships! You say in your letter that you have decided not to go to Asia. For my part I should have preferred your going, and I fear that there may be some offence given in that matter. Nevertheless, I am not the man to blame you, especially considering that I have not gone to a province myself. I shall be quite Content with the inscriptions you have placed in your <a href=/people/8779 target=_blank>Amaltheium</a>, especially as <a href=/people/8423 target=_blank>Thyillus</a> has deserted me and <a href=/people/437 target=_blank>Archias</a> written nothing about me. The latter, I am afraid, having composed a Greek poem on the <a href=/people/4188 target=_blank>Luculli</a>, is now turning his attention to the Caecilian drama. I have thanked <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> on your account, and I have intrusted the letter to <a href=/people/2893 target=_blank>Mallius</a> I have heretofore written to you more rarely because I had no one to whom I could trust a letter, and was not sure of your address. I have puffed you well. If <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> should refer any business of yours to me, I will undertake it. But at present he is more intent on his own business, in which I am rendering him some assistance. If you mean to stay any length of time in one place you may expect frequent letters from me: but pray send even more yourself. I wish you would describe your <a href=/people/8779 target=_blank>Amaltheium</a> to me, its decoration and its plan; and send me any poems or stories you may have about <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amaltheia</a>. I should like to make a copy of it at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. I will forward you something of what I have written. At present there is nothing finished. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.1.17'><b>&sect; Att.1.17</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;XXII (Att. I, 17) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 5 DECEMBER: Your letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has made me realize that my brother Quintus's feelings have undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and judgments have varied widely from time to time. This has not only caused me all the pain which my extreme affection for both of you was bound to bring, but it has also made me wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such deep offence, or such an extraordinary change of feeling. And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had sunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of his offence was so great as your letter indicates; but on the other I did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished. However, I consoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>, or somewhere in your part of the country: and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview. For I need not say in writing to you, who know it quite well, how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive in taking offence. But it most unfortunately happened that you did not see him anywhere. For the impression he had received from the artifices of others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the old affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the strongest influence of all. And yet, as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours. For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it. But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to the letter he sent to you from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, and about the language which you suppose him to have used both at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> among your friends and on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness. For if you will only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally signs of a good heart and lastly — and this is the main thing — that we must mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?), or faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that there should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you and is not loved by you. That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city you let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for I am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek official advancement, while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an honourable privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you. In affection towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I put you first. For indeed, indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the variations of my fortunes. Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your consolation a welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at this moment of your absence, it is not only your advice — in which you excel — but the interchange of speech — in which no one gives me so much delight as you do — that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection is always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by securing popularity, or in the mere business of my family? In all these I missed you and our conversations before my brother left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and still more do I miss them since. Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum or at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation. The modest reserve which characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning these facts; but on this occasion it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your character put straight and cleared in my eyes. Yet, in the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger, there is one fortunate circumstance — that your determination of not going to a province was known to me and your other friends, and had been at various times before distinctly expressed by yourself; so that your not being his guest may be attributed to your personal tastes and judgments, not to the quarrel and rupture between you. And so those ties which have been broken will be restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will retain all their old inviolability. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I find politics in a shaky condition; everything is unsatisfactory and foreboding change. For I have no doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are all but alienated from the senate. Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the authority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict. I happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfactory nature of my cause. But here is another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light as possible! The companies which had contracted with the censors for Asia complained that in the heat of the competition they had taken the contract at an excessive price; they demanded that the contract should be annulled. I led in their support, or rather, I was second, for it was <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> who induced them to venture on this demand. The case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession of rash speculation. Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got no concession, they would be completely alienated from the senate. Here again I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and secured them a full and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December, delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders. The business is not yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the senate has been made manifest: for no one had spoken against it except the consul-designate, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>; while our hero <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> had still to speak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached. Thus I, in the maintenance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's work; but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, I am constructing what I may call a road towards the maintenance of our power, a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will nevertheless give you a hint. I cultivate close intimacy with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. I foresee what you will say. I will use all necessary precautions, and I will write another time at greater length about my schemes for managing the Republic. You must know that <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> has it in his mind to stand for the consulship at once; for there are said to be only two candidates in prospect. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is thinking of coming to terms with him by the agency of <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a>, and <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> also thinks he may effect a coalition with him by means of C. <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>. You smile? This is no laughing matter, believe me. What else shall I write to you? What? I have plenty to say, but must put it off to another time. If you mean to wait till you hear, let me know. For the moment I am satisfied with a modest request, though it is what I desire above everything — that you should come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> as soon as possible. 5 December. </p>                        </div>

I, 18) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 20 JANUARY: Believe me there is nothing at this moment of which I stand so much in need as a man with whom to share all that causes me anxiety: a man to love me; a man of sense to whom I can speak without affectation, reserve, or concealment. For my brother is away — that most open-hearted and affectionate of men. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is not a human being, but Mere sound and air, a howling wilderness. While you, who have so often lightened my anxiety and my anguish of soul by your conversation and advice, who are ever my ally in public affairs, my confidant in all private business, the sharer in all my conversations and projects — where are you? So entirely am I abandoned by all, that the only moments of repose left me are those which are spent with my wife, pet daughter, and sweet little <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. For as to those friendships with the great, and their artificial attractions, they have indeed a certain glitter in the outside world, but they bring no private satisfaction. And so, after a crowded morning levee, as I go down to the forum surrounded by troops of friends, I can find no one out of all that crowd with whom to jest freely, or into whose ear I can breathe a familiar sigh. Therefore I wait for you, I long for you, I even urge on you to come for I have many anxieties, many pressing cares, of which I think, if I once had your ears to listen to me, I could unburden myself in the conversation of a single walk. And of my private anxieties, indeed, I shall conceal all the stings and vexations, and not trust them to this letter and an unknown letter-carrier. These, however — for I don't want you to be made too anxious — are not very painful: yet they are persistent and worrying, and are not put to rest by the advice or conversation of any friend. But in regard to the Republic I have still the same courage and purpose, though it has again and again of its own act eluded treatment. For should I put briefly what has occurred since you left, you would certainly exclaim that the Roman empire cannot be maintained much longer. Well, after your departure our first scene, I think, was the appearance of the <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodian</a> scandal, in which having, as I thought, got an opportunity of pruning licentiousness and keeping our young men within bounds, I exerted myself to the utmost, and lavished all the resources of my intellect and genius, not from dislike to an individual, but from the hope of not merely correcting, but of completely curing the state. The Republic received a crushing blow when this jury was won over by money and the opportunity of debauchery. See what has followed we have had a consul inflicted upon us, whom none except us philosophers can look at without a sigh. What a blow that is! Though a decree of the senate has been passed about bribery and the corruption of juries, no law has been carried; the senate has been harassed to death, the Roman knights alienated. So that one year has undermined two buttresses of the Republic, which owed their existence to me, and me alone; for it has at once destroyed the prestige of the senate and broken up the harmony of the orders. And now enter this precious year! It was inaugurated by the suspension of the annual rites of Iuventas; for <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> initiated M. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>'s wife in some rites of his own! Our <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>, being annoyed at that, divorced his wife. Yet the old <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352248LIda class=demonym long=24.7708 lat=35.2263>Idaean</a> shepherd had only injured <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>; our Roman <a href=/people/112 target=_blank>Paris</a> thought <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> as proper an object of injury as <a href=/people/53 target=_blank>Menelaus</a>. Next there is a certain tribune named C. <a href=/people/1701 target=_blank>Herennius</a>, whom you, perhaps, do not even know — and yet you may know him, for he is of your tribe, and his father Sextus used to distribute money to your tribesmen — this person is trying to transfer P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> to the plebs, and is actually proposing a law to authorize the whole people to vote in <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s affair in the campus. I have given him a characteristic reception in the senate, but he is the thickest-skinned fellow in the world. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is an excellent consul, and much attached to me, but he has lowered his influence by promulgating (though only for form's sake) an identical bill about <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. But the son of <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a>, God in heaven! What a cowardly and spiritless fellow for a soldier! How well he deserves to be exposed, as he is, day after day to the abuse of <a href=/people/8088 target=_blank>Palicanus</a>! Farther, an agrarian law has been promulgated by <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, a poor production enough, almost identical with that of <a href=/people/3072 target=_blank>Plotius</a>. But meanwhile a genuine statesman is not to be found, even in a dream. The man who could be one, my friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> — for such he is, as I would have you know — defends his two penny embroidered toga by saying nothing. <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> never risks his popularity by a word. The others you know without my telling you. They are such fools that they seem to expect that, though the Republic is lost, their fish-ponds will be safe. There is one man who does take some trouble, but rather, as it seems to me, with consistency and honesty, than with either prudence or ability — <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. He has been for the last three months worrying those unhappy publicani, who were formerly devoted to him, and refuses to allow of an answer being given them by the senate. And so we are forced to suspend all decrees on other subjects until the publicani have got their answer. For the same reason I suppose even the business of the foreign embassies will be postponed. You now understand in what stormy water we are and as from what I have written to you in such strong terms you have a view also of what I have not written, come back to me, for it is time you did. And though the state of affairs to which I invite you is one to be avoided, yet let your value for me so far prevail, as to induce you to come there even in these vexatious circumstances. For the rest I will take care that due warning is given, and a notice put up in all places, to prevent you being entered on the census as absent; and to get put on the census just before the lustration is the mark of your true man of business. So let me see you at the earliest possible moment. Farewell. 20 January in the Consulship of Q. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and L. <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>. </p>                        </div>

I, 19) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 15 MARCH: It is not only if I had as much leisure as you, but also if I chose to send letters as short as yours usually are, should I easily beat you and be much the more regular in writing. But, in fact, it is only one more item in an immense and inconceivable amount of business, that I allow no letter to reach you from me without its containing some definite sketch of events and the reflections arising from it. And in writing to you, as a lover of your country, my first subject will naturally be the state of the republic; next, as I am the nearest object of your affection, I will also write about myself, and tell you what I think you will not be indisposed to know. Well then, in public affairs for the moment the chief subject of interest is the disturbance in Gaul. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469043UAug class=ethnic long=4.299 lat=46.945>Aedui</a> — our brethren — have recently fought a losing battle, and the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a> are undoubtedly in arms and making raids upon our province. The senate has decreed that the two Consuls should draw lots for the Gauls, that a levy should be held, all exemptions from service be suspended, and legates with full powers be sent to visit the states in Gaul, and see that they do not join the <a href=/people/12015 target=_blank>Helvetii</a>. The legates are Quintus <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> Creticus, L. <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>, and lastly — a case of rich unguent on lentils — <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, son of <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodianus</a>. And while on this subject I cannot omit mentioning that when among the consulars my name was the first to come up in the ballot, a full meeting of the senate declared with one voice that I must be kept in the city. The same occurred to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> after me; so that we two appeared to be kept at home as pledges of the safety of the Republic. Why should I look for the bravos of others when I get these compliments at home? Well, the state of affairs in the city is as follows. The agrarian law is being vehemently pushed by the tribune <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, with the support of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, but it has nothing popular about it except its supporter. From this law I, with the full assent of a public meeting, proposed to omit all clauses which adversely affected private rights. I proposed to except from its operation such public land as had been so in the consulship of P. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a> and L. <a href=/people/1017 target=_blank>Calpurnius</a>. I proposed to confirm the titles of holders of those to whom <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had actually assigned lands. I proposed to retain the men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/434109UVol class=place long=10.86 lat=43.4035>Volaterrae</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435119UArr class=place long=11.8804 lat=43.4605>Arretium</a> — whose lands <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had declared forfeited but had not allotted — in their holdings. There was only one section in the bill that I did not propose to omit, namely, that land should be purchased with this money from abroad, the proceeds of the new revenues for the next five years. But to this whole agrarian scheme the senate was opposed, suspecting that some novel power for <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was aimed at. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, indeed, had set his heart on getting the law passed. I, however, with the full approval of the applicants for land, maintained the holdings of all private owners — for, as you know, the landed gentry form the bulk of our party's forces — while I nevertheless satisfied the people and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> (for I wanted to do that also) by the purchase clause; for, if that was put on a sound footing, I thought that two advantages would accrue — the dregs might be drawn from the city, and the deserted portions of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> be repeopled. But this whole business was interrupted by the war, and has cooled off. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is an exceedingly good consul, and much attached to me. That other one is such a ninny that he clearly doesn't know what to do with his purchase. This is all my public news, unless you regard as touching on public affairs the fact that a certain <a href=/people/1701 target=_blank>Herennius</a>, a tribune, and a fellow tribesman of yours — a fellow as unprincipled as he is needy — has now begun making frequent proposals for transferring P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> to the plebs; he is vetoed by many of his colleagues. That is really, I think, all the public news. For my part, ever since I won what I may call the splendid and immortal glory of the famous fifth of December (though it was accompanied by the jealousy and hostility of many), I have never ceased to play my part in the Republic in the same lofty spirit, and to maintain the position I then inaugurated and took upon myself. But when, first, by the acquittal of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> I clearly perceived the insecurity and rotten state of the law courts; and, secondly, when I saw that it took so little to alienate my friends the publicani from the senate — though with me personally they had no quarrel; and, thirdly, that the rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me, I thought I must look out for some greater security and stronger support. So, to begin with, I have brought the man who had been too long silent on my achievements, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself, to such a frame of mind as not once only in the senate, but many times and in many words, to ascribe to me the preservation of this empire and of the world. And this was not so important to me — for those transactions are neither so obscure as to need and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> from a difference of opinion on these measures. testimony, nor so dubious as to need commendation — as to the Republic; for there were certain persons base enough to think that some misunderstanding would arise between me with him I have united myself in such close intimacy that both of us can by this union be better fortified in his own views, and more secure in his political position. However, the dislike of the licentious dandies, which had been roused against me, has been so far softened by a Conciliatory manner on my part, that they all combine to show me marked attention. In fine, while avoiding churlishness to anyone, I do not curry favour with the populace or relax any principle; but my whole course of conduct is so carefully regulated, that, while exhibiting an example of firmness to the Republic, in my own private concerns — in view of the instability of the loyalists, the hostility of the disaffected, and the hatred of the disloyal towards me — I employ a certain caution and circumspection, and do not allow myself, after all, to be involved in these new friendships so far but that the famous refrain of the cunning <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> frequently sounds in my ears: Keep sober and distrust these wisdom's sinews! Of my course and way of life, therefore, you see, I think, what may be called a sketch or outline. Of your own business, however, you frequently write to me, but I cannot at the moment supply the remedy you require. For that decree of the senate was passed with the greatest unanimity on the part of the rank and file, though without the support of any of us consulars. For as to your seeing my name at the foot of the decree, you can ascertain from the decree itself that the subject put to the vote at the time was a different one, and that this clause about free peoples was added without good reason. It was done by P. <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> the younger, who delivered his vote among the last, but it cannot be altered after such an interval of time. Accordingly, the meetings, which at first were crowded, have long ceased to be held. If you have been able, notwithstanding, by your insinuating address to get a trifle of money out of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyonians</a>, I wish you would let me know. I have sent you an account of my consulship written in Greek. If there is anything in it which to a genuine <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> like yourself seems to be un-Greek or unscholarly, I shall not say as <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> said to you (at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381134UPan class=place long=13.363 lat=38.118>Panhormus</a>, was it not?) about his own history, that he had interspersed certain barbarisms and solecisms for the express purpose of proving that it was the work of a Roman. No, if there is anything of that sort in my book, it will be without my knowledge and against my will. When I have finished the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> version I will send it to you; and thirdly, you may expect a poem on the subject, for I would not have any method of celebrating my praise omitted by myself. In this regard pray do not quote Who will praise his sire? For if there is anything in the world to be preferred to this, let it receive its due meed of praise, and I mine of blame for not selecting another theme for my praise. However, what I write is not panegyric but history. My brother Quintus clears himself to me in a letter, and asserts that he has never said a disparaging word of you to anyone. But this we must discuss face to face with the greatest care and earnestness: only do come to see me again at last! This <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a>, to whom I intrust my letter, seems to me a very good fellow, steady, devoted to you, and exactly the sort of man which your letter to me had described. 15 March. </p>                        </div>

I, 20) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 13 MAY: On my return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> on the 12th of May, our friend <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> handed me your letter dated 13th February. It is this letter of yours which I will now proceed to answer. And first let me say how glad I am that you have fully understood my appreciation of you; and next how excessively rejoiced I am that you have been so extremely reasonable in regard to those particulars in which you thought that I and mine had behaved unkindly, or with insufficient consideration for your feelings: and this I regard as a proof of no common affection, and of the most excellent judgment and wisdom. Wherefore, since you have written to me in a tone so delightful, considerate, friendly and kind, that I not only have no call to press you any farther, but can never even hope to meet from you or any other man with so much gentleness and good nature, I think the very best course I can pursue is not to say another word on the subject in my letters. When we meet, if the occasion should arise, we will discuss it together. As to what you say about politics, your suggestions indeed are both affectionate and wise, and the course you suggest does not differ substantially from my own policy — for I must neither budge an inch from the position imposed upon me by my rank, nor must I without forces of my own enter the lines of another, while that other, whom you mention in your letter, has nothing large-minded about him, nothing lofty, — nothing which is not abject and time-serving. However, the course I took was, after all, perhaps not ill-calculated for securing the tranquillity of my own life; but, by heaven, I did greater service to the Republic than, by suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, I did to myself, when I brought conviction home to the wavering mind of a man of the most splendid fortune, influence and popularity, and induced him to disappoint the disloyal and praise my acts. Now if I had been forced to sacrifice consistency in this transaction, I should not have thought anything worth that price; but the fact is that I have so worked the whole business, that I did not seem to be less consistent from my complacency to him, but that he appeared to gain in character by his approbation of me. In everything else I am so acting, and shall continue so to act, as to prevent my seeming to have done what I did do by mere chance. My friends the loyalists, the men at whom you hint, and that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a> which you say has fallen to my lot, I will not only never desert, but even if I am deserted by her, I shall still stand by my ancient creed. However, please consider this, that since the death of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> I am holding this road for the loyalists without any garrison or Company. For as Rhinton, I think, says: Some are stark naught, and some care not at all. However, how our friends the fish-breeders envy me I will write you word another time, or will reserve it till we meet. But from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> nothing shall ever tear me: either because that course is the right one, or because it is most to my interests, or because I am far from being dissatisfied with the estimation in which I am held by the senate. As to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyonians</a>, as I wrote to you before, there is not much to be hoped for in the senate. For there is no one now to lay a complaint before it. Therefore, if you are waiting for that, you will find it a tedious business. Fight some other way if you can. At the time the decree was passed no one noticed who would be affected by it, and besides the rank and file of the senators voted in a great hurry for that clause. For cancelling the senatorial decree the time is not yet ripe, because there are none to complain of it, and because also many are glad to have it so, some from spite, some from a notion of its equity. Your friend <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is an admirable consul: I have only one fault to find with him — he doesn't receive the news from Gaul of the restoration of peace with much pleasure. He wants a triumph, I suppose. I could have wished a little less of that sort of thing: in other respects he is splendid. But the son of <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> behaves in such a way, that his consulship is not a consulship but a stigma on our friend <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>. Of my writings I send you my consulship in Greek completed. I have handed that book to L. <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a>. My <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> works I think you like, but as a Greek you envy this Greek book. If others write treatises on the subject I will send them to you, but I assure you that, as soon as they have read mine, somehow or other they become slack. To return to my own affairs, L. <a href=/people/897 target=_blank>Papirius</a> <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>, an excellent man and an admirer of mine, has presented me with the books left him by <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>. As your friend <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> told me that I could take them without breaking the lex Cincia, I told him that I should have great pleasure in accepting them, if he brought them to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Wherefore, as you love me, as you know that I love you, do try by means of friends, clients, guests, or even your freedmen or slaves, to prevent the loss of a single leaf. For I am in urgent need of the Greek books which I suspect, and of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> books which I know, that he left: and more and more every day I find repose in such studies every moment left to me from my labours in the forum. You will, I say, do me a very great favour, if you will be as zealous in this matter as you ever are in matters in which you suppose me to feel strongly; and <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>'s own affairs I recommend to your kindness, for which he thanks you extremely. A prompt visit from yourself is a thing which I do not merely ask for, I advise it. </p>                        </div>

II, 1) TO ATTICUS (IN GREECE) ROME, JUNE: On the 1st of June, as I was on my way to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>, and eagerly getting out of the way of M. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>'s gladiators, your boy met me, and delivered to me a letter from you and a history of my consulship written in Greek. This made me glad that I had some time before delivered to L. <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a> a book, also written in Greek, on the same subject, to take to you. For if I had read yours first you might have said that I had pilfered from you. Although your essay (which I have read with pleasure) seemed to me just a trifle rough and bald, yet its very neglect of ornament is an ornament in itself, as women were once thought to have the best perfume who used none. My book, on the other hand, has exhausted the whole of <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a>'s unguent case, and all the paint-boxes of his pupils, and even <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>'s colours. This, as you tell me in another letter, you glanced over at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>, and afterwards I suppose received it from <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a>. I should not have ventured to send it to you until I had slowly and fastidiously revised it. However, <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a>, in his letter of acknowledgment from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, says that as he read my memoir, which I had sent him with a view to his writing on the same subject with more elaboration, he was not only not incited to write, but absolutely made afraid to do so. In a word, I have routed the Greeks. Accordingly, as a general rule, those who were pressing me for material to work up, have now ceased to bother me. Pray, if you like the book, see to there being copies at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> and other Greek towns for it may possibly throw some lustre on my actions. As for my poor speeches, I will send you both those you ask for and some more also, since what I write to satisfy the studious youth finds favour, it seems, with you also. [For it suited my purpose — both because it was in his Philippics that your fellow citizen <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a> gained his reputation, and because it was by withdrawing from the mere controversial and forensic style of oratory that he acquired the character of a serious politician — to see that I too should have speeches that may properly be called consular. Of these are, first, one delivered on the 1st of January in the senate, a second to the people on the agrarian law, a third on <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, a fourth for <a href=/people/4675 target=_blank>Rabirius</a>, a fifth on the Sons of the Proscribed, a sixth when I declined a province in public meeting, a seventh when I allowed <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> to escape, which I delivered the day after <a href=/people/1018 target=_blank>Catiline</a> fled, a ninth in public meeting on the day that the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a> made their revelation, a tenth in the senate on the 5th of December. There are also two short ones, which may be called fragments, on the agrarian law. This whole cycle I will see that you have. And since you like my writings as well as my actions, from these same rolls you will learn both what I have done and what I have said — or you should not have asked for them, for I did not make you an offer of them.] You ask me why I urge you to come home, and at the same time you intimate that you are hampered by business affairs, and yet say that you will nevertheless hasten back, not only if it is needful, but even if I desire it. Well, there is certainly no absolute necessity, yet I do think you might plan the periods of your tour somewhat more conveniently. Your absence is too prolonged, especially as you are in a neighbouring country, while yet I cannot enjoy your society, nor you mine. For the present there is peace, but if my young friend Pulcher's madness found means to advance a little farther, I should certainly summon you from your present sojourn. But <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> is offering him a splendid opposition and will continue to do so. Need I say more? He is a truly patriotic consul and, as I have ever thought, naturally an honest man. That person, however, makes no disguise, but avowedly desires to be elected tribune. But when the matter was mooted in the senate, I cut the fellow to pieces, and taunted him with his changeableness in seeking the tribuneship at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after having given out at <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, that he was a candidate for the aedileship; and went on to say that we needn't much trouble ourselves, for that he would not be permitted to ruin the Republic any more as a plebeian, than patricians like him had been allowed to do so in my consulship. Presently, on his saying that he had completed the journey from the straits in seven days, and that it was impossible for anyone to have gone out to meet him, and that he had entered the city by night, and making a great parade of this in a public meeting, I remarked that that was nothing new for him: seven days from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, three hours from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414138UInt class=place long=13.7899 lat=41.4373>Interamna</a>! Entered by night, did he? so he did before! No one went to meet him? neither did anyone on the other occasion, exactly when it should have been done! In short, I bring our young upstart to his bearings, not only by a set and serious speech, but also by repartees of this sort. Accordingly, I have come now to rally him and jest with him in quite a familiar manner. For instance, when we were escorting a candidate, he asked me whether I had been accustomed to secure <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> places at the gladiatorial shows?  No, said I. Well, I intend to start the practice, said he, as their new patron; but my sister, who has the control of such a large part of the consul's space, won't give me more than a single foot. Don't grumble, said I, about one of your sister's feet; you may lift the other also. A jest, you will say, unbecoming to a consular. I confess it, but I detest that woman — so unworthy of a consul. For A shrew she is and with her husband jars, and not only with <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, but also with <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, because she is annoyed at their interference in this business. You ask about the agrarian law: it has completely lost all interest, I think. You rather chide me, though gently, about my intimacy with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. I would not have you think that I have made friends with him for my own protection; but things had come to such a pass that, if by any chance we had quarreled, there would inevitably have been violent dissensions in the state. And in taking precautions and making provision against that, I by no means swerved from my well-known loyalist policy, but my object was to make him more of a loyalist and induce him to drop somewhat of his time-serving vacillation: and he, let me assure you, now speaks in much higher terms of my achievements (against which many had tried to incite him) than of his own. He testifies that while he served the state well, I preserved it. What if I even make a better citizen of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who has now the wind full in his sails — am I doing so poor a service to the Republic? Furthermore, if there was no one to envy me, if all, as they ought to be, were my supporters, nevertheless a preference should still be given to a treatment that would cure the diseased parts of the state, rather than to the use of the knife. As it is, however, since the knighthood, which I once stationed on the slope of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a>, with you as their standard-bearer and leader, has deserted the senate, and since our leading men think themselves in a seventh heaven, if there are bearded mullets in their fish-ponds that will come to hand for food, and neglect everything else, do not you think that I am doing no mean service if I secure that those who have the power, should not have the will, to do any harm? As for our friend <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, you do not love him more than I do: but after all, with the very best intentions and the most absolute honesty, he sometimes does harm to the Republic. He speaks and votes as though he were in the Republic of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, not in the scum of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>. What could be fairer than that a man should be brought to trial who has taken a bribe for his verdict? <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> voted for this: the senate agreed with him. The equites declared war on the senate, not on me, for I voted against it. What could be a greater piece of impudence than the equites renouncing the obligations of their contract? Yet for the sake of keeping the friendship of the order it was necessary to submit to the loss. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> resisted and carried his point. Accordingly, though we have now had the spectacle of a consul thrown into prison, of riots again and again stirred up, not one of those moved a finger to help, with whose support I and the consuls that immediately followed me were accustomed to defend the Republic. Well, but, say you, are we to pay them for their support? What are we to do if we can't get it on any other terms? Are we to be slaves to freedmen or even slaves? But, as you say, assez de serieux! <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> carried my tribe with better credit than his own; he lost that of <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>. His accusation of <a href=/people/896 target=_blank>Nasica</a> was not creditable, but was conducted with moderation: he spoke so badly that he appeared when in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> to have ground at the mills more than at the lessons of <a href=/people/949 target=_blank>Molon</a>. He was somewhat angry with me because I appeared for the defence: however, he is now making up to me again on public grounds. I will write you word how <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> is getting on when I have seen <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, who will be here in a couple of days. The injury done you by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyonians</a> you attribute to <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and his imitator <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>. Why? did not that blow reach many excellent citizens? But since the senate has so determined, let us commend it, and not be in a minority of one. My <a href=/people/1323 target=_blank>Amaltheia</a> is waiting and longing for you. My <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> and Pompeian properties please me immensely, except that they have overwhelmed me — me, the scourge of debt — not exactly in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=demonym long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinthian</a> bronze, but in the bronze which is current in the market. In Gaul I hope peace is restored. My Prognostics, along with my poor speeches, expect shortly. Yet write and tell me what your ideas are as to returning. For <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a> sent a message to me that you would be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> some time in July. That does not agree with your letter which you wrote to me about your name being put on the Census roll. <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>, as I have already told you, has presented me with all books left by his brother. This gift of his depends upon your seeing to it with care. Pray, if you love me, take measures for their preservation and transmission to me. You could do me no greater favour, and I want the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=demonym long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latin</a> books preserved with as much care as the Greek. I shall look upon them as virtually a present from yourself. I have written to <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>: I had not said anything to him about you by word of mouth; for I did not suppose that you carried on your business in that province, or look upon you in the light of general money-lender: but I have written, as in duty bound, with all seriousness. </p>                        </div>

II, 3) TO ATTICUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME) ROME (DECEMBER) First, I have good news for you, as I think. <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> has been acquitted. <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> was his counsel. The verdict is thought to have been a favour to <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a>'s son; and <a href=/people/799 target=_blank>Epicrates</a>, I suspect, has been up to some mischief. I didn't like his boots and his white leggings. What it is I shall know when you arrive. When you find fault with the narrow windows, let me tell you that you are criticising the Cyropaedeia. For when I made the same remark, <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a> used to answer that the views of the gardens through broad lights were not so pleasant. For let α be the eye,βγ the object seen, δ and ε the rays ... you see the rest. For if sight resulted from the impact of images, the images would be in great difficulties with a narrow entrance: but, as it is, that effusion of rays gets on quite nicely. If you have any other fault to find you won't get off without an answer, unless it is something that can be put right without expense. I now come to January and my political attitude, in which, after the manner of the <a href=/people/2935 target=_blank>Socratics</a>, I shall put the two sides; at the end, however, as they were wont to do, the one which I approve. It is, indeed, a matter for profound refection. For I must either firmly oppose the agrarian law — which will involve a certain struggle, but a struggle full of glory — or I must remain altogether passive, which is about equivalent to retiring to <a href=/people/8323 target=_blank>Solonium</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>; or, lastly, I must actually assist the bill, which I am told <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> fully expects from me without any doubt. For <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> has been with me (I mean <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s intimate), and solemnly assured me that he meant to avail himself of my advice and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s in everything, and intended to endeavour to reconcile <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. In this last course there are the following advantages: a very close union with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and, if I choose, with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> also; a reconciliation with my political enemies, peace with the common herd, ease for my old age. But the conclusion of the third book of my own poem has a strong hold on me: Meanwhile the tenor of thy youth's first spring, Which still as consul thou with all thy soul And all thy manhood heldest, see thou keep, And swell the chorus of all good men's praise.  These verses <a href=/people/736 target=_blank>Calliope</a> herself dictated to me in that book, which contains much written in an aristocratic spirit, and I cannot, therefore, doubt that I shall always hold that The best of omens is our country's cause. But let us reserve all this for our walks during the <a href=/people/4494 target=_blank>Compitalia</a>. Remember the day before the <a href=/people/4494 target=_blank>Compitalia</a>. I will order the bath to be heated, and <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> is going to invite <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a>. We will add your mother to the party.

I have ordered the money for it to be paid you at once, that you may not put it down to the Cost of presentation copies. But as I have mentioned the subject of money, I will beg you to try to come to a settlement with <a href=/people/1599 target=_blank>Titinius</a> in any way you can. If he doesn't stand by his own proposal, what I should like best is that what he bought at too dear a rate should be returned, if that can be done with <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a>'s Consent: if that too is impossible, let the money be paid rather than have any difficulty. I should be very glad if you would settle this before you leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with your usual kindness and exactness. So <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, you say, is for <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>? I only wish he would go — on the same terms as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398267USke class=person long=26.7002 lat=39.8074>Skepsian</a>! But I don't grudge him the job; for a more convenient time for my taking a free legation is when my brother Quintus shall have settled down again, as I hope, into private life, and I shall have made certain how that priest of the Bona <a href=/people/2402 target=_blank>Dea</a> intends to behave. Meanwhile I shall find my pleasure in the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a> with a mind undisturbed, or rather glad and cheerful; for it will never occur to me to envy <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> or to regret that I have not been false to myself. As to geography, I will try to satisfy you, but I promise nothing for certain. It is a difficult business, but nevertheless, as you bid me, I will take care that this country excursion produces something for you. Mind you let me know any news you have ferreted out, and especially who you think will be the next consuls. However, I am not very curious; for I have determined not to think about politics. I have examined <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>'s woodlands. What need I say?

I mean my friend <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who is as good as a hundred thousand in my eyes. What, too, will history say of me six hundred years hence? I am much more afraid of that than of the petty gossip of the men of today. But, I think, I had better lie low and wait. For if it is really offered to me, I shall be to a certain extent in a position of advantage, and then will be the time to weigh the matter. There is, upon my word, a certain Credit even in refusing. Wherefore, if <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> by chance has consulted you on the matter, do not absolutely decline. What I am expecting to hear from you is, what <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a> says, and how he endures being left in the lurch, and who are intended to be consuls — is it <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, or, as I am told in a letter, <a href=/people/11077 target=_blank>Servius Sulpicius</a> with <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>?-and whether there are any new laws or anything new at all; and, since <a href=/people/12142 target=_blank>Nepos</a> is leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who is to have the augurship — the one bait by which those personages could catch me! You see what a high price I put on myself! Why do I talk about such things, which I am eager to throw aside, and to devote myself heart and soul to philosophy. That, I tell you, is my intention. I could wish I had done so from the first. Now, however, that I have found by experience the hollowness of what I thought so splendid, I am thinking of doing business exclusively with the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>. In spite of that, please give me in your next some more definite information about <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> and who is intended to fill his place, and what is doing about P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, and, in fact, take your time and tell me everything as you promise; and pray write me word what day you think of leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in order that I may tell you where I am likely to be and send me a letter at once on the subjects of which I have written to you.

And, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, the subject is difficult of explanation and monotonous, and does not seem to admit of as much embellishment as I thought, and, in short — which is the chief point-any excuse for being idle seems to me a good one: for I am even hesitating as to settling at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> and spending the rest of my life there, where, indeed, I would rather have been a duovir than at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

Where there is no one besides myself who Cares whether one of the twenty commissioners is alive and well? Where no one intrudes upon me, and yet all are fond of me? This, this is the place to play the statesman in For yonder, not only am I not allowed to do so, but I am sick of it besides. Accordingly, I will compose a book of secret memoirs for your ear alone in the style of <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, or a more acrid one still. Nor have I now any politics except to hate the disloyal, and even that without any bitterness, but rather with a certain enjoyment in writing. But to return to business: I have written to the city quaestors about my brother's affair. See what they say to it, whether there is any hope of the cash in denarii; or whether we are to be palmed off with Pompeian cistophori. Furthermore, settle what is to be done about the wall.

II, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ANTIUM (APRIL) About the geography I will think again and again. But you ask for two of my speeches, one of which I did not care to write out because I had ended it abruptly, the other because I did not want to praise the man I did not like. But that, too, I will see about. At all events, something shall be forthcoming to prevent your thinking that I have been absolutely idle. I am quite delighted to hear what you tell me about Publius; pray ferret out the whole story, and bring it to me you when come, and meanwhile write anything you may make out or suspect, and especially as to what he is going to do about the legation. For my part, before reading your letter, I was anxious that the fellow should go, not, by heaven, in order to avoid his impeachment — for I am wonderfully keen to try issues with him — but it seemed to me that, if he had secured any popularity by becoming a plebeian, he would thereby lose it. Well, why did you transfer yourself to the Plebs? Was it to make a call on <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a>? Tell me: do the kings of Armenia refuse to receive patricians? In a word, I had polished up my weapons to tear this embassy of his to pieces. But if he rejects it, and thus moves the anger of those proposers and augurs of the lex curiata, it will be a fine sight! By <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, to speak the truth, our friend Publius is being treated a little contemptuously! In the first place, though he was once the only man at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s house, he is not now allowed to be one in twenty: in the next place, one legation had been promised him and another has been given. The former fine fat one for the levying of money is reserved, I presume, for <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/439129UPis class=person long=12.9145 lat=43.9109>Pisaurum</a> or for the gourmand <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>: this latter miserable business, which might be very well done by a courier, is given to him, and his tribuneship deferred till it suits them. Irritate the fellow, I beg you, as much as you can. The one hope of safety is their mutual disagreement, the beginning of which I have got scent of from <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. Moreover, <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a> is fuming at being cheated out of the consulship. Megabocchus and our blood-thirsty young men are most violently hostile. May there be added to this, I pray, may there be added, this quarrel about the augurate! I hope I shall often have some fine letters to send you on these subjects. But I want to know the meaning of your dark hint that some even of the quinqueviri are speaking out. What can it be? If there is anything in it, there is more hope than I had thought. And I would not have you believe that I ask you these questions with any view to action, because my heart is yearning to take part in practical politics. I was long ago getting tired of being at the helm, even when it was in my power.

I summon them: I ask if they have any letters. No, say they. What do you say, said I, nothing from <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>? Frightened to death by my voice and look, they confessed that they had received one, and that it had been lost on the journey. Need I say more? I was intensely annoyed. For no letter has come from you for the last few days without something in it important and entertaining. In these circumstances, if there was anything in the letter dated 15th April, worth telling, pray write at once, that I may not be left in ignorance; but if there was nothing but banter, repeat even that for my benefit. And let me inform you that young <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> has been to call on me. What he said about Publius agreed exactly with your letter. He himself, moreover, wonderfully holds our proud kings in hate. He told me that the young men generally were equally incensed, and could not put up with the present state of things. If there is hope in them, we are in a good way. My opinion is that we should leave things to take their course. I am devoting myself to my memoir. However, though you may think me a <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a>, I am really the laziest fellow in the world. But get into your head my several journeys, that.you may settle where you intend to come and see me.

II, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ANTIUM, MAY: <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> the quaestor having suddenly informed me that he was sending a slave to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I write these hurried lines in order to get out of you the wonderful conversations with Publius, both those of which you write, and that one which you keep dark, and assert that it would be too long to write your answer to him; and, still farther, the one that has not yet been held, which that <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Iuno</a> of a woman is to report to you when she gets back from <a href=/people/8323 target=_blank>Solonium</a>. I wish you to believe that there can be nothing I should like more. If, however, the compact made about me is not kept, I am in a seventh heaven to think that our friend the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> itish plebeian-maker will learn what a fine return he has made to my brilliant speeches, of which you may expect a splendid recantation. For, as well as I can guess, if that profligate is in favour with our tyrants, he will be able to crow not only over the cynic consular, but over your <a href=/people/12004 target=_blank>Tritons</a> of the fish-ponds also. For I shall not possibly be an object of anybody's jealousy when robbed of power and of my influence in the senate. If, on the other hand, he should quarrel with them, it will not suit his purpose to attack me. However, let him attack. Charmingly, believe me, and with less noise than I had thought, has the wheel of the Republic revolved more rapidly, anyhow, than it should have done owing to <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s error, but still more owing to the unconstitutional conduct of those who have neglected the auspices, the <a href=/people/1037 target=_blank>Aelian</a> law, the Iunian, the Licinian, the Caecilian and Didian, who have squandered all the safeguards of the constitution, who have handed over kingdoms as though they were private estates to tetrachs, and immense sums of money to a small coterie. I see plainly now the direction popular jealousy is taking, and where it will finally settle. Believe that I have learnt nothing from experience, nothing from <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, if you don't shortly see the time of our government an object of regret. For if the power of the senate was disliked, what do you think will be the case when it has passed, not to the people, but to three unscrupulous men? So let them then make whom they choose consuls, tribunes, and even finally clothe <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>'s men with the double-dyed purple of the priesthood, you will see before long that the great men will be not only those who have made no false step, but even he who did make a mistake, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. For, as to myself, if your comrade Publius will let me, I think of playing the sophist: if he forces me, I shall at least defend myself, and, as is the trick of my trade, I publicly promise to Strike back at him who first is wroth with me. May the country only be on my side: it has had from me, if not more than its due, at least more than it ever demanded. I would rather have a bad passage with another pilot than be a successful pilot to such ungrateful passengers. But this will do better when we meet. For the present take an answer to your questions. I think of returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> on the 3rd of May.

XI, 12) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TRES TABERNAE, 19 APRIL: Are they going to deny that Publius has been made a plebeian? This is indeed playing the king, and is utterly intolerable. Let Publius send some men to witness and seal my affidavit: I will take an oath that my friend Gnaeus, the colleague of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, told me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> that he had been present as augur to take the auspices. Two delightful letters from you delivered at the same time! For which I do not know what I am to pay you by way of reward for good news. That I owe you for them I candidly confess. But observe the coincidence. I had just made my way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> on to the via <a href=/people/2715 target=_blank>Appia</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416129UTTa class=place long=12.8711 lat=41.5647>Three Taverns</a>, on the very day of the <a href=/people/6341 target=_blank>Cerealia</a> (19th April), when my friend <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> meets me on his way from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. At the same piace and the same moment comes a slave from you with letters. The former asked me whether I hadn't heard the news? I said, No. Publius, says he, is a candidate for the tribuneship. You don't mean it? Yes, I do, says he, and at daggers drawn with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. His object is to rescind his acts. What says <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? said I. He denies having proposed any lex for his adoption. Then he poured forth about his own hatred, and that of <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> and <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> <a href=/people/12142 target=_blank>Nepos</a>. I embraced the youth and said good-bye to him, hastening to your letters. A fig for those who talk about a living voice! What a much clearer view I got of what was going on from your letters than from his talk! About the current rumours of the day, about the designs of Publius, about <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Iuno</a>'s trumpet calls, about <a href=/people/5485 target=_blank>Athenio</a> who leads his roughs, about his letter to Gnaeus, about the conversation of <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> and <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>. Besides, how eager you have made me to hear about the fast dinner party which you mention! I am greedy in curiosity, yet I do not feel at all hurt at your not writing me a description of the symposium: I would rather hear it by word of mouth. As to your urging me to write something, my material indeed is growing, as you say, but the whole is still in a state of fermentation — new wine in the autumn. when the liquor has settled down and become clarified, I shall know better what to write. And even if you cannot get it from me at once, you shall be the first to have it: only for some time you must keep it to yourself. You are quite right to like <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>; he is an excellent writer, and a much better citizen than these rulers of ours who reverse his name. I write this letter at four o'clock in the afternoon of the <a href=/people/6341 target=_blank>Cerealia</a> (12th April), immediately after reading yours, but I shall despatch it, I think, tomorrow, by anyone I may chance to meet on the road. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> is delighted with your letter, et <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> le philosophe salue Titus l'homme d'etat. </p>                        </div>

By heaven, I would start at once for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, only that I see that the most convenient place to await your visit is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>: but only up to the 6th of May! For you see with what bores my ears are pestered.

And in spite of all this am I to make good my words, Let us attempt something great, and requiring much thought and leisure? However, I will do something for you, and not spare my labour. </p>                        </div>

II, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, APRIL: As you say, things are as shifting (I see) in public affairs as in your letter; still, that very variety of talk and opinion has a charm for me. For I seem to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when I am reading your letter, and, as is the regular thing in questions of such importance, to hear something first on one side and then on the other. But what I can't make out is this — what he can possibly hit upon to settle the land question without encountering opposition. Again, as to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>'s firmness in putting off the comitia, it only conveys the expression of his own views, without really offering any remedy for the state of the Republic. Upon my word, my only hope is in Publius! Let him become, let him become a tribune by all means, if for no other reason, yet that you may be brought back from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>! For I don't see how you can possibly afford to miss him, especially if he shall elect to have a wrangle with me! But, seriously, if anything of the sort occurs, you would, I am certain, hurry back. But even supposing this not to be the case, yet whether he runs. amuck or helps to raise the state, I promise myself a fine spectacle, if only I may enjoy it with you sitting by my side. Just as I was writing these words, enter <a href=/people/5248 target=_blank>Sebosus</a>! I had scarcely got out a sigh when Good day, says <a href=/people/3343 target=_blank>Arrius</a>. This is what you call going out of town! I shall really be off to My native mountains and my childhood's haunts. In fine, if I can't be alone I would rather be with downright countryfolk than with such ultra-cockneys. However, I shall, since you don't say anything for certain, wait for you up to the 5th of May. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> is much pleased with the attention and care you have bestowed on her controversy with Mulvius. She is not aware that you are supporting the common cause of all holders of public land. Yet, after all, you do pay something to the publicani; she declines to pay even that, and, accordingly, she and <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> — most conservative of boys — send their kind regards. </p>                        </div>

II, 16) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 29 APRIL: On the day before the Kalends of May, when I had dined and was just going to sleep, the letter was delivered to me containing your news about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land. You needn't ask: at first it gave me such a shock that there was no more sleep for me, though that was the result of thought rather than pain. On refection, however, the following ideas occurred to me. In the first place, from what you had said in your previous letter — that you had heard from a friend of his that a proposal was going to be made which would satisfy everybody — I had feared some very sweeping measure, but I don't think this is anything of the sort. In the next place, by way of consolation, I persuaded myself that the hope of a distribution of land is now all centred on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> territory. That land cannot support more than 5,000, as to give ten iugera apiece: the rest of the crowd of expectants must necessarily be alienated from them. Besides, if there is anything that more than another could inflame the feeling of the aristocrats, who are, I notice, already irritated, it is this; and all the more that with port-dues in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> abolished, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land divided, what home revenue is there except the five per cent. on manumissions? And even that, I think, it will only take a single trumpery harangue, cheered by our lackeys, to throw away also. What our friend Gnaeus can be thinking of I can't imagine —  For still he blows, and with no slender pipe, But furious blasts by no mouth-band restrained to be induced to countenance such a measure as that. For hitherto he has fenced with these questions: he approved <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s laws, but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> must be responsible for his proceedings in carrying them; he himself was satisfied with the agrarian law; whether it could be vetoed by a tribune or no was nothing to do with him; he thought the time had come for the business of the Alexandrine king to be settled; it was no business of his to inquire whether <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> had been watching the sky on that occasion or no; as to the publicani he had been willing to oblige that order; what was going to happen if <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> came down to the forum at that time he could not have guessed. But now, my <a href=/people/3467 target=_blank>Sampsiceramus</a>, what will you say to this? That you have secured us a revenue from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335359LALi class=place long=35.9447 lat=33.5204>Antilibanus</a> and removed that from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land? Well, how do you mean to vindicate that? I shall coerce you, says he, by means of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s army. You won't coerce me, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, by your army so much as by the ingratitude of the so-called boni who have never made me any return, even in words, to say nothing of substantial rewards. But if I had put out my strength against that coterie, I should certainly have found some way of holding my own against them. As things are, in view of the controversy between your friend <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> and my friend <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> — the former recommending the life of action, the latter the life of contemplation — I think I have already obeyed both. For as to <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, I think I have satisfied his requirements; at present my eyes are fixed on the school which not only allows of my abstaining from business, but blames me for not having always done so. Wherefore let me throw myself, my dear Titus, into those noble studies, and let me at length return to what I ought never to have left. As to what you say about Quintus's letter, when he wrote to me he was also in front a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> and behind a — - . I don't know what to say about it; for in the first lines of his letter he makes such a lamentation over his continuance in his province, that no one could help being affected: presently he calms down sufficiently to ask me to correct and edit his Annals. However, I would wish you to have an eye to what you mention, I mean the duty on goods transferred from port to port. He says that by the advice of his council he has referred the question to the senate. He evidently had not read my letter, in which after having considered and investigated the matter, I had sent him a written opinion that they were not payable. If any Greeks have already arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> from Asiaon that business, please look into it and, if you think it right, explain to them my opinion on the subject. If, to save the good cause in the senate, I can retract, I will gratify the publicani: but if not, to be plain with you, I prefer in this matter the interests of all Asia and the merchants; for it affects the latter also very seriously. I think it is a matter of great importance to us. But you will settle it. Are the quaestors, pray, still hesitating on the cistophorus question? If nothing better is to be had, after trying everything in our power, I should be for not refusing even the lowest offer. I shall see you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> and offer you country entertainment, since you have despised this at the seaside. </p>                        </div>

He is preparing a despotism and no mistake about it: For what else is the meaning of that sudden marriage union, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land affair, the lavish expenditure of money? If these measures were final, even then the mischief had been very great; but the nature of the case makes finality impossible. For how could these measures possibly give them any pleasure in themselves? They would never have gone so far as this unless they had been paving the way for other fatal steps. Immortal Gods !-But, as you say, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> about the 10th of May we will not weep over these questions, lest the hard work and midnight oil I have spent over my studies shall turn out to have been wasted, but discuss them together calmly. For I am not so much consoled by a sanguine disposition as by philosophic indifference, which I call to my aid in nothing so much as in our civil and political business. Nay, more, whatever vanity or sneaking love of reputation there is lurking in me — for it is well to know one's faults — is tickled by a certain pleasurable feeling. For it used to sting me to the heart to think that centuries hence the services of <a href=/people/3467 target=_blank>Sampsiceramus</a> to the state would loom larger than my own. That anxiety, at least, is now put to rest. For he is so utterly fallen that, in comparison with him, <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> might seem to be standing erect after his fall. But all this when we meet. Yet, as far as I can see, you will be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> when I come. I shall not be at all sorry for that, if you can conveniently manage it. But if you come to see me, as you say in your letter, I wish you would fish out of <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> how Arabarches is disposed to me. You will, of course, inquire with your usual zeal, and bring me the result to serve as a kind of suggestion for the line of conduct I am to adopt. From his conversation we shall be able to get an inkling of the whole situation. </p>                        </div>

II, 18) TO ATTICUS (ON HIS WAY TO EPIRUS) ROME I have received several letters from you, which showed me with what eagerness and anxiety you desired to know the news. We are bound hard and fast on every side, and are no longer making any difficulty as to being slaves, but fearing death and exile as though greater evils, though they are in fact much smaller ones. Well, this is the position-one unanimously groaned over, but not relieved by a word from anyone. The object, I surmise, of the men in power is to leave nothing for anyone to lavish. The only man who opens his mouth and openly disapproves is the young <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. He is loudly cheered, and greeted in the forum in the most complimentary manner, and many other tokens of goodwill are bestowed on him by the loyalists; while <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> is pursued with shouts, jeers, and hisses. From such circumstances it is not hope but indignation that is increased, for you see the citizens allowed to express their sentiments, but debarred from carrying them out with any vigour. And to omit details, the upshot is that there is now no hope, I don't say of private persons, but even of the magistrates being ever free again. Nevertheless, in spite of this policy of repression, conversation, at least in society and at dinner tables, is freer than it was. Indignation is beginning to get the better of fear, though that does not prevent a universal feeling of despair. For this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> law contains a cause imposing an oath to be taken by candidates in public meeting, that they will not suggest any tenure of public land other than that provided in the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> laws. All the others take the oath without hesitation: Laterensis is considered to have shown extraordinary virtue in retiring from his canvass for the tribuneship to avoid the oath. But I don't care to write any more about politics. I am dissatisfied with myself, and cannot write without the greatest pain. I hold my own position with some dignity, considering the general repression, but considering my achievements in the past, with less courage than I should like. I am invited by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in a very gentlemanly manner to accept a legation, to act as legatus to himself, and even an open votive legation is offered me. But the latter does not give sufficient security, since it depends too much on the scrupulousness of <a href=/people/10152 target=_blank>Pulchellus</a> and removes me just when my brother is returning; the former offers better security and does not prevent my returning when I please. I am retaining the latter, but do not think I shall use it. However, nobody knows about it. I don't like running away; I am itching to fight. There is great warmth of feeling for me. But I don't say anything positive: you will please not to mention it. I am, in fact, very anxious about the manumission of <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> and some other things, but I have become hardened by this time. I could wish, or rather ardently desire, that you were here: then I should not want advice or consolation. But anyhow, be ready to fly hither directly I call for you. </p>                        </div>

II, 19) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (JULY) I have many causes for anxiety, both from the disturbed state of politics and from the personal dangers with which I am threatened. They are very numerous; but nothing gives me more annoyance than the manumission of <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>: To think that he should have no reverence for my authority! But of authority I say nothing — that he should have no fear of a quarrel with me, to put it mildly But what I am to do I don't know, nor indeed is there so much in the affair as you would think from the talk about it. For myself, I am positively incapable of being angry with those I love deeply. I only feel vexed, and that to a surprising degree. Other vexations are on really important matters. The threats of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> and the conflicts before me touch me only slightly. For I think I can either confront them with perfect dignity or decline them without any embarrassment. You will say, perhaps, Enough of dignity, like the proverb, 'Enough of the oak': an you love me, take thought for safety! Ah, dear me, dear me, why are you not here? Nothing, certainly, could have escaped you. I, perhaps, am somewhat blinded, and too much affected by my high ideal. I assure you there never was anything so scandalous, so shameful, so offensive to all sorts, Conditions and ages of men alike, as the present state of affairs. It is more so, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, than I could have wished, but not more than I had expected. Your populares have now. taught even usually quiet men to hiss. <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> is praised to the skies: I don't know why, but he has the same sort of applause as his Who by delays restored alone our State. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> — the man I loved — has, to my infinite sorrow, ruined his own reputation They hold no one by affection, and I fear they will be forced to use terror. I, however, refrain from hostility to their cause owing to my friendship for him, and yet I cannot approve, lest I should stultify my own past. The feeling of the people was shown as clearly as possible in the theatre and at the shows. For at the gladiators both master and supporters were overwhelmed with hisses. At the games of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> the actor <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> made a pert allusion to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, in the words: By our misfortunes thou art — Great. He was encored countless times. When he delivered the line, The time will come when thou wilt deeply mourn That self-same valour, the whole theatre broke out into applause, and so on with the rest. For the verses do seem exactly as though they were written by some enemy of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s to hit the time. If neither laws nor customs can control, etc., caused great sensation and loud shouts. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> having entered as the applause died away, he was followed by the younger <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. The latter received an ovation such as used to be given to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> when the constitution was still intact. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was much annoyed. A despatch is said to have been sent flying off to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. They are offended with the equites, who rose to their feet and cheered <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, and are at war with everybody. They are threatening the Roscian law, and even the corn law. There has been a great hubbub altogether. For my part, I should have preferred their doings being silently ignored; but that, I fear, won't be allowed. Men are indignant at what nevertheless must, it seems, be put up with. The whole people have indeed now one voice, but its strength depends rather on exasperation than anything to back it up. Furthermore, our Publius is threatening me: he is hostile, and a storm is hanging over my head which should bring you post haste to town. I believe that I am still firmly supported by the same phalanx of all loyal or even tolerably loyal men which supported me when consul. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> displays no common affection for me. He also asserts that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> is not going to say a word about me. In which he is not deceiving me, but is himself deceived. <a href=/people/3566 target=_blank>Cosconius</a> having died, I am invited to fill his place. That would indeed be a case of invited to a dead man's place. I should have been beneath contempt in the eyes of the world, and nothing could be conceived less likely to secure that very personal safety of which you speak. For those commissioners are disliked by the loyalists, and so I should have retained my own unpopularity with the disloyal, with the addition of that attaching to others. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wishes me to accept a legateship under him. This is a more honourable method of avoiding the danger. But I don't wish to avoid it. What do I want, then? Why, I prefer fighting. However, I have not made up my mind. Again I say, Oh that you were here! However, if it is absolutely necessary I will summon you. What else is there to say? What else? This, I think: I am certain that all is lost. For why mince matters any longer? But I write this in haste, and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, in rather a nervous state. On some future occasion I will either write to you at full length, if I find a very trustworthy person to whom to give a letter, or if I write darkly you will understand all the same. In these letters I will be <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, you <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a>; the rest shall be in riddles. Here I cultivate <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a>, and pay him assiduous attention. I hear <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>'s edicts have been sent to you. Our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is hot with indignation and wrath at them. </p>                        </div>

About politics I will write briefly: for I am now afraid lest the very paper should betray me. Accordingly, in future, if I have anything more to write to you, I shall clothe it in covert language. For the present the state is dying of a novel disorder for although everybody disapproves of what has been done, complains, and is indignant about it, and though there is absolutely no difference of opinion on the subject, and people now speak openly and groan aloud, yet no remedy is applied: for we do not think resistance possible without a general slaughter, nor see what the end of concession is to be except ruin. <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> is exalted to the skies as far as admiration and affection go. His edicts and speeches are copied out and read. He has reached the summit of glory in a novel way. There is now nothing so popular as the dislike of the popular party. I have my fears as to how this will end. But if I ever see my way clearly in anything, I will write to you more explicitly. For yourself, if you love me as much as I am sure you do, take care to be ready to come in all haste as soon as I call for you. But I do my best, and shall do so, to make it unnecessary. I said I would call you <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> in my letters, but it is not necessary to change your name. I'll call myself <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> and you <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, but I will use neither my own hand-writing nor seal, if the letter happens to be such as I should not wish to fall into the hands of a stranger. <a href=/people/1447 target=_blank>Diodotus</a> is dead; he has left me perhaps 1,000 sestertia. <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> has postponed the elections to the 18th of October, in an edict expressed in the vein of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a>. I have received the books from <a href=/people/1725 target=_blank>Vibius</a>: he is a miserable poet, but yet he is not without some knowledge nor wholly useless. I am going to copy the book out and send it back. </p>                        </div>

II, 21) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (JULY) Why should I write to you on the Republic in detail? It is utterly ruined; and is, so far, in a worse state than when you left it, that then a despotism seemed to be oppressing it which was popular with the multitude, and though offensive to the loyalists, yet short of actual mischief; but now all on a sudden they have become so universally hated, that I tremble to think what will be the end of it. For we have had experience of those men's resentment and violence, who have ruined everything in their anger against <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>; yet they were employing such slow poisons, that it seemed as though our end might be painless. Now, however, I fear they have been exasperated by the hisses of the crowd, the talk of the respectable classes, and the murmurs of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. For my part, I was in hopes, as I often used actually to say to you, that the wheel of the state chariot had made its revolution with scarcely any noise and leaving scarcely any visible rut; and it would have been so, if people could only have waited till the storm had blown over. But after sighing in secret for a long time they all began, first to groan, and at last to talk and shout. Accordingly, that friend of ours, unaccustomed to being unpopular, always used to an atmosphere of praise, and revelling in glory, now disfigured in body and broken in spirit, does not know which way to turn; sees that to go on is dangerous, to return a betrayal of vacillation; has the loyalists his enemies, the disloyal themselves not his friends. Yet see how soft-hearted I am. I could not refrain from tears when, on the 25th of July, I saw him making a speech on the edicts of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>. The man who in old times had been used to bear himself in that place with the utmost confidence and dignity, surrounded by the warmest affection of the people, amidst universal favour — how humble, how cast down he was then! How ill-content with himself, to say nothing of how unpleasing to his audience! Oh, what a spectacle! No one could have liked it but <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> — no one else in the world! Not I, for considering his headlong descent from the stars, he seemed to me have lost his footing rather than to have been deliberately following a path; and, as <a href=/people/460 target=_blank>Apelles</a>, if he had seen his <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Venus</a>, or <a href=/people/1057 target=_blank>Protogenes</a> his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282PIal class=place long=28.143 lat=36.399>Ialysus</a> daubed with mud, would, I presume, have felt great sorrow, so neither could I behold without great sorrow a man, portrayed and embellished with all the colours of my art, suddenly disfigured. Although no one thought, in view of the <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> business, that I was bound to be his friend, yet so great was my affection for him, that no amount of injury was capable of making it run dry. The result is that those Archilochian edicts of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> against him are so popular, that one can't get past the place where they are put up for the crowd of readers, and so deeply annoying to himself that he is pining with vexation. To me, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, they are distressing, both because they give excessive pain to a man whom I have always loved, and because I fear lest one so impulsive and so quick to strike, and so unaccustomed to personal abuse, may, in his passionate resentment, obey the dictates of indignation and anger. I don't know what is to be the end of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>. As things stand at present he is enjoying a wonderful reputation. For on his having postponed the comitia to October, as that is a measure which is always against the popular feeling, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had imagined that the assembly could be induced by a speech of his to go to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>'s house; but after a long harangue full of seditious suggestions, he failed to extract a word from any-one. In short, they feel that they do not possess the cordial goodwill of any section: all the more must we fear some act of violence. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> is hostile to us. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> persists in asserting that he will do nothing against me. It is risky for me to believe that, and I am preparing myself to meet his attack. I hope to have the warmest feelings of all orders on my side. I have personally a longing for you, and circumstances also demand your presence at that time. I shall feel it a very great addition to my policy, to my courage, and, in a word, to my safety, if I see you in time. <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a> does all I can expect. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> talks like an angel. I have hopes that I shall come off with flying colours, or at any rate without being molested. Be sure and tell me how you are, how you are amusing yourself, and what settlement you have come to with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=ethnic long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyonians</a>. </p>                        </div>

I am sure you would have stayed if you had foreseen what was going to happen. For then we should have had no difficulty in keeping <a href=/people/10152 target=_blank>Pulchellus</a> in order, or at least should have known what he was going to do. As things are, he darts about, talks like a madman, never sticks to anything: threatens now this one and now that: seems likely, in reality, to do whatever turns up. When he sees how unpopular the present state of things is, he seems to intend an attack upon the authors of it; but when he again recalls their power and armies, he transfers his hostility to the loyalists. Me personally he threatens at one time with violence, at another with impeachment. With him <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has remonstrated, and, as he tells me himself — for I have no other evidence — has urgently remonstrated, pointing out that he would himself lie under the extreme imputation of perfidy and unprincipled conduct, if any danger to me were created by the man whom he had himself armed by acquiescing in his becoming a plebeian: that both he and <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> had pledged themselves in regard to me: if <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> did not respect that, he should show such annoyance that everyone would understand that he valued my friendship above everything. Having said this and much else to the same effect, he told me that the fellow at first argued against it at great length and for a long time, but eventually gave way and declared that he would do nothing against his wishes. Nevertheless, he has not ceased since then speaking of me with the greatest bitterness. But even if be had not done so, I should have felt no confidence in him, but should have been making every preparation, as in fact I am doing. As it is, I am so conducting myself that every day the affections of people towards me and the strength of my position are enhanced. I don't touch politics in any shape or way; I employ myself with the greatest assiduity in pleading causes and in my regular forensic business. And this I feel is extremely gratifying, not only to those who enjoy my services, but also to the people generally. My house is crowded; I am met by processions; the memory of my consulship is renewed; men's feelings are clearly shown: my hopes are so raised, that the struggle hanging over me seems at times one from which I need not shrink. Now is the time that I need your advice, your love and fidelity. Wherefore come post haste! Everything will be easy for me if I have you. I can carry on many negotiations through our friend <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>, which will be on firmer ground with you to back them up; a great deal can be elicited from Publius himself, and be brought to my knowledge, which cannot possibly be kept concealed from you; a great deal also — but it is absurd to enumerate particulars, when I want you for everything. I would like you to be convinced of this above all, that everything will be simplified for me if I see you: but it all turns on this coming to pass before he enters on his office. I think that if you are here while <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> is egging on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> — as you can get out of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> himself, by the agency of <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Iuno</a>, how far they are acting in good faith — we shall escape molestation, or at any rate not be left under a delusion. You don't stand in need of entreaties or urgency from me. You understand what my wish is, and what the hour and the importance of the business demand. As to politics, I can tell you nothing except that everybody entertains the greatest detestation for those who are masters of everything. There is, however, no hope of a change. But, as you easily understand, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself is discontented and extremely dissatisfied with himself. I don't see Clearly what issue to expect: but Certainly such a state of affairs seems likely to lead to an outbreak of some sort. <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s books — a careless writer and a poor poet, and yet not without some useful information — I have sent back to you. I have had pleasure in admitting <a href=/people/3218 target=_blank>Numerius</a> <a href=/people/6713 target=_blank>Numestius</a> to my friendship, and I find him a man of character and good sense, worthy of your recommendation. </p>                        </div>

II, 23) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (JULY OR AUGUST) I don't think you have ever before read a letter of mine not written by my own hand. You will be able to gather from that how I am distracted with business. For as I had not a moment to spare and was obliged to take a walk in order to refresh my poor voice, I have dictated this while walking. The first thing, then, which I wish you to know is that our friend <a href=/people/3467 target=_blank>Sampsiceramus</a> is exceedingly dissatisfied with his position, and desires to be restored to the place from which he has fallen; that he confides his annoyance to me, and is without disguise seeking for a remedy — which I don't think can be found. The second thing is that all on that side, whether promoters or mere hangers-on, are falling out of fashion, though no one opposes them: there never was a greater unanimity of feeling or talk everywhere. For myself (for I am sure you wish to know it) I take part in no political deliberations, and have devoted myself entirely to my forensic business and work. Thereby, as may easily be understood, I have frequent occasion to refer to my past achievements and to express my regret. But the brother of our <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Iuno</a> is giving utterance to all kinds of alarming threats, and, while disclaiming them to <a href=/people/3467 target=_blank>Sampsiceramus</a>, makes an open avowal and parade of them to others. Wherefore, loving me as much as I know you do, if you are asleep, wake up; if you are standing, start walking; if you are walking, set off running; if you are running, take wings and fly. You can scarcely believe how much I confide in your advice and wisdom, and above all in your affection and fidelity. The importance of the interests involved perhaps demands a long disquisition, but the close union of our hearts is contented with brevity. It is of very great importance to me that, if you can't be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the elections, you should at least be here after his election is declared.

II, 24) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (JULY OR AUGUST) In the letter which I delivered to <a href=/people/6713 target=_blank>Numestius</a> I begged you to come back, in the most urgent and vehement terms it was possible to use. To the speed which I then enjoined even add something if you possibly can. And yet do not be agitated, for I know you well, and am not ignorant of how love is all compact of thought and fear. But the matter, I hope, is going to be less formidable in the end than it was at its beginning. That fellow <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, our old informer, promised <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, as far as I can make out, that he would secure young <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> being brought under some suspicion of guilt. Accordingly, he wormed his way into intimacy with the young man, and having, as is proved, often met him, at last went the length of telling him that he had resolved by the help of his slaves to make an attack upon <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and assassinate him. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> reported this to his father, the latter to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. The matter was reported to the senate. <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, on being brought in, at first denied that he had ever had any appointment with <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. However, he did not long stick to that, but immediately Claimed the protection of the state as giving information. There was a shout of no to this but he went on to state that there had been a confederacy of young men under the leadership of <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, to which <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a> had at first belonged, and Q. <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a> (I mean <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> ) and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, son of the flamen, with the privity of his father: that afterwards C. <a href=/people/1598 target=_blank>Septimius</a>, secretary to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, had brought him a dagger from <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>. That made the whole thing ridiculous, as though <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> would have been at a loss for a dagger unless the consul had given him one; and it was all the more scouted because on the 5th of May <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> had told <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to be on his guard against plots; on which occasion <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had thanked him. Young <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, being brought into the senate, spoke in answer to the allegations of <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>; and on this particular occasion the strongest thing against <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> was his having said that the plan of the young men was to attack <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in the forum, with the help of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>'s gladiators, and that in this the ring-leader was <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a>, who was ascertained to have been in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> at that time. A decree of the senate is passed that <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, having confessed to having 'worn a dagger,' should be cast into prison; that anyone releasing him would be guilty of treason to the state. The opinion generally held is that the whole affair had been arranged. <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> was to be caught in the forum with a dagger, and his slaves also with weapons, and he was then to offer to lay an information; and this would have been carried out, had not the Curios given <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> previous information. Presently the decree of the senate was read in public assembly. Next day, however, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — the man who formerly as praetor had bidden Q. <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> speak on the ground below — now brought <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> on to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BRoA class=place long=12.48458 lat=41.89258>Rostra</a>, and placed him on an elevation to which <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, though consul, was prevented from aspiring. Here that fellow said exactly what he chose about public affairs, and, having come there primed and instructed, first struck <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a>'s name out of his speech, though he had named him most emphatically in the senate, so that it was easy to see that a night and a nocturnal intercession had intervened: next he named certain men on whom he had not cast even the slightest suspicion in the senate: L. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, by whom he said that C. <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> was usually sent to him — the man who on a former occasion had backed a prosecution of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>; L. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, whose house had been agreed on as the headquarters of the Conspirators. Me he did not name, but he said that an eloquent consular, who lived near the consul, had said to him that there was need of some <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> <a href=/people/7192 target=_blank>Ahala</a> or <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> being found. He added at the very end, on being recalled by <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a> after the assembly had been dismissed, that he had been told by <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> that my son-in-law <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> was privy to these proceedings, as M. Laterensis also. At present <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> is on trial for violence before <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> Dives, and when condemned he intends to claim the impunity of an informer; and if he obtains that, there seem likely to be some prosecutions. I don't despise the danger, for I never despise any danger, but neither do I much fear it. People indeed show very great affection for me, but I am quite tired of life: such a scene of misery is it all. It was only the other day that we were fearing a massacre, which the speech of that gallant old man Q. <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a> prevented: now this one, which we might have feared any day, has suddenly turned up. In short, nothing can be more unfortunate than I, or more fortunate than <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, both in the splendour of his life and in the time of his death. However, in the midst of these miseries I keep my spirit erect and undismayed, and maintain my position in a most dignified manner and with great caution. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> bids me have no anxiety about <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, and shows the most cordial goodwill to me in everything he says. I desire to have you to suggest my policy, to be the partner in my anxieties, and to share my every thought. Therefore I have commissioned <a href=/people/6713 target=_blank>Numestius</a> to urge you, and I now entreat you with the same or, if possible, greater earnestness, to literally fly to us. I shall breathe again when I once see you. </p>                        </div>

For instance, you know I lately wrote to you about <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s kindness to me, and that you wrote me back word that the circumstance gave you the greatest delight. But I should have preferred your writing to him and saying that he was doing all I could expect — not because he was, but in order that he might do so. For he is a man of astonishing whims, as you know, tortuous and no wise — . But I stick to the rule Follies of those in power, etc. But, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, that other friend of yours, <a href=/people/5045 target=_blank>Hortalus</a> — with what a liberal hand, with what candour, and in what ornate language has he praised me to the skies, when speaking of the praetorship of <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> and that incident of the <a href=/people/11071 target=_blank>Allobroges</a>. I assure you nothing could have been more affectionate, complimentary, or more lavishly expressed. I very much wish that you would write and tell him that I sent you word of it. Yet why write? I think you are on your way and are all but here. For I have urged you so strongly to come in my previous letters. I am expecting you with great impatience, longing for you very much; nor do I call for you more than circumstances themselves and the state of the times. Nothing can be more desperate than the position of politics, nothing more unpopular than the authors of it. I — as I think, hope, and imagine — am safe behind a rampart of goodwill of the strongest kind. Wherefore fly to me: you will either relieve me from all annoyance or will share it. My letter is all the shorter because, as I hope, I shall be able in a very short time to talk over what I want to say face to face. Take care of your health. </p>                        </div>

III, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 29 APRIL: I ARRIVED at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 17th of April. On that day your slaves delivered me your letter, and some other slaves, on the next day but one, brought me another. As to your invitation and advice to stay at your house in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, your kindness is most gratifying, and far from being a novelty. It is a plan that would have exactly suited my wishes, if I might have spent all my time there: for I loathe a crowd of visitors, I can scarcely bear the light, and that solitude, especially in a spot so familiar, would have been the reverse of disagreeable. But to put up there as a mere stage in my journey! In the first place it is far out of my way, and in the next it is only four days from <a href=/people/6273 target=_blank>Autronius</a> and the rest, and in the third place you are not there. Had I been going to reside permanently, a fortified castle would have been an advantage, but to one only passing through it is unnecessary. Why, if I had not been afraid, I should have made for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> — there were circumstances that made me much wish to go — but as it is, I have enemies in the neighbourhood, you are not there, and I fear they might hold even that town not to be the legal distance from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, nor do you mention by what day I am to expect you. As to your urging me to remain alive, you Carry one point — that I should not lay violent hands upon myself: the other you cannot bring to pass — that I should not regret my policy and my continuance in life. For what is there to attach me to it, especially if the hope which accompanied me on my departure is nonexistent? I will not attempt to enumerate all the miseries into which I have fallen through the extreme injustice and unprincipled conduct, not so much of my enemies, as of those who were jealous of me, because I do not wish to stir up a fresh burst of grief in myself, or invite you to share the same sorrow. I say this deliberately — that no one was ever afflicted with so heavy a calamity, that no one had ever greater cause to wish for death; while I have let slip the time when I might have sought it most creditably. Henceforth death can never heal, it can only end my sorrow. In politics I perceive that you collect all circumstances that you think may inspire me with a hope of a change: and though they are insignificant, yet, since you will have it so, let us have patience. In spite of what you say, you will catch us up if you make haste. For I will either come into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> to be near you, or I will travel slowly through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411203LCan class=place long=20.3136 lat=41.1136>Candavia</a>. My hesitation about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> is not caused by vacillation on my part, but by the fact that I do not know where I am likely to see my brother. As to him, I neither know how I am to see him, nor how I shall let him go. That is the greatest and most distressing of all my distresses. I would indeed have written to you oftener, and at greater length, had it not been that sorrow, while it has affected all parts of my intellect, has above all entirely destroyed my faculty for this kind of writing. I long to see you. Take care of your health. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, 29 April. </p>                        </div>

Added to this, while I was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a> two messages reached me: the first, that my brother was coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> by ship; the second, that he was coming through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a> by land. Accordingly, I sent a message to meet him at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, telling him to come thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>. I myself continued my journey, and arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a> on the 23rd of May, but have no certain intelligence about his journey except that he had left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> some time ago. At present I am feeling very nervous as to what steps are being taken at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Although you say in one of your letters, dated the 15th of May, that you hear that he will be vigorously prosecuted, in another you say that things are calming down. But then the latter is dated a day before the former; which makes me all the more anxious. So while my own personal sorrow is every day tearing my heart and wearing out my strength, this additional anxiety indeed scarcely leaves me any life at all. However, the voyage itself was very difficult, and he perhaps, being uncertain where I was, has taken some other course. For my freedman <a href=/people/8136 target=_blank>Phaetho</a> saw nothing of him. <a href=/people/8136 target=_blank>Phaetho</a> was driven by the wind from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Ilium</a> to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>, and met me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225PPel class=place long=22.518 lat=40.754>Pella</a>. How formidable other circumstances are I am fully aware, and I don't know what to say to you. I fear everything, nor is there any misery which would not seem possible in my present unfortunate position. Miserable as I still am in the midst of my heavy trials and sorrows, now that this anxiety is added to them, I remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a> in a state of suspense without venturing upon any step whatever. Now to answer you. I have not seen <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> <a href=/people/891 target=_blank>Trypho</a>. I comprehend from your letter what you and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> have been saying. That any movement in politics is impending I Cannot see as Clearly as you either see, or perhaps only suggest for my <a href=/people/3927 target=_blank>Consolation</a>. For, as the Case of <a href=/people/12245 target=_blank>Tigranes</a> was passed over, all hope of a rupture is at an end. You bid me thank <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>: I will do so; also <a href=/people/3859 target=_blank>Hypsaeus</a>. As to your advice not to go farther off till the acta of the month of May reach me, I think I shall do as you suggest. But where to stay? I have not yet come to any decision. And indeed my mind is so uneasy about Quintus, that I can determine on nothing. However, I will let you know immediately. From the incoherent nature of my letters I think you will understand the agitation of my mind, caused not so much by my misery, though I have been overwhelmed by an in-credible and unparalleled calamity, as by the recollection of my blunder. For by whose unprincipled advice I was egged on and betrayed you certainly now perceive, and oh that you had perceived it before, and had not given your whole mind to lamentation along with me! Wherefore, when you are told that I am prostrate and unmanned with grief, consider that I am more distressed at my own folly than at the result of it, in having believed a man whom I did not think to be treacherous. My writing is impeded both by the recollection of my own disasters, and by my alarm about my brother. Yes, pray look after and direct all the affairs you mention. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> expresses the warmest gratitude to you.

III, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) THESSALONICA, 13 JUNE: My brother Quintus having quitted Asia before the 1st of May, and arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> on the 15th, he would have to make great haste to prevent proceedings being commenced against him in his absence, supposing there to be some one who was not content with the misfortunes we have already sustained. Accordingly, I preferred that he should hurry on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> rather than come to me; and at the same time — for I will tell you the truth, and it will give you a notion of the extent of my wretchedness — I could not make up my mind to see him, devotedly attached to me as he is, and a man of most tender feelings, or to obtrude upon him my miseries and ruin in all their wretchedness, or to endure their being seen by him. And I was besides afraid of what certainly would have happened — that he would not have had the resolution to leave me. I had ever before my eyes the time when he would either have to dismiss his lictors,' or be violently torn from my arms. The prospect of this bitter pain I have avoided by the other bitter pain of not seeing my brother. It is all you, who advised me to continue living, that have forced me into this distressful position. Accordingly, I am paying the penalty of my error. However, I am sustained by your letter, from which I easily perceive how high your own hopes are. This did give me some consolation, but only, after all, till you passed from the mention of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> Because, though a provincial governor retained his lictors till he reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he was bound to go straight home or dismiss them. to the passage beginning Now try and win over <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> and men of that sort. In heaven's name, my dear <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, don't you yet perceive by whose means, by whose treachery, by whose dishonest advice, I have been ruined? But all this I will discuss with you when we meet. I will only say this much, which I think you know: it is not my enemies, but my jealous rivals, that have ruined me. Now, however, if things are really as you hope, I will keep up my spirits, and will rely upon the hope on which you bid me rely.

For myself one of my miseries also consists in fear — the business of my unhappy brother. If I could only know how it stands, I should know what I ought to do.

III, 10) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) THESSALONICA, 17 JUNE: The public transactions up to the 25th of May I have learnt from your letter. I am waiting for the rest, as you advised, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>; and when they arrive I shall be better able to decide where to be. For if there is any reason, if any action is being taken, if I shall see any hopes, I shall either wait in the same place or go to your house; but if, as you say, these hopes have vanished into air, I shall look out for something else. At present you do not give me any indication except the disagreement of those friends of yours, which, however, arises between them on every kind of subject rather than myself. Therefore I don't see what good it is to me. However, as long as you all will have me hope, I shall obey you. For as to your scoldings so frequent and so severe, and your saying that I am faint-hearted, I would ask you what misery is there so heavy as not to be included in my disfranchisement? Did anyone ever fall from such a high position, in so good a cause, with such endowments of genius, wisdom and popularity, with such powerful supports from all loyalists? Can I forget what I was, and not feel what I am? Of what honour, of what glory, of what children, of what means, of what a brother I am deprived? This last, indeed, to draw your attention to a new kind of disaster — though I valued him, and always had done so, more than myself — I have avoided seeing, lest I should behold his grief and mourning, or lest I-whom he had left in the highest prosperity-should obtrude myself upon him in a state of ruin and humiliation. I pass over the other particulars that are past bearing: for I am prevented by my tears. And here, let me ask, am I to be blamed for my grief, or for the unfortunate mistake of not retaining these advantages (and I could easily have done so, had not a plot for my destruction been hatched within my own walls), or at least of not losing them without losing my life at the same time? My purpose in writing these words is that you should rather console me, as you do, than think me deserving of correction or chiding; and the reason of the comparative brevity of my letters is, in the first place, that I am hindered by outbursts of sorrow, and, in the second place, that I have news to expect from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> rather than any to communicate myself. But when that news arrives I will let you know my plans. Pray, as you have done hitherto, write to me on as many subjects as possible, that I may not be ignorant of any possible thing there is to know. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, 17 June. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, not a word is said about it. In these circumstances you find fault with me for distressing myself, when the fact is I am already more distressed than anybody ever was, as you know very well. You hold out hope as a consequence of the elections. What hope can there be with the same man tribune, and a consul-designate who is my enemy? But you have dealt me a blow in what you say about my speech having got abroad. Pray do your best to heal that wound, as you express it. I did indeed write one some time ago, in a fit of anger at what he had first composed against me; but I had taken such pains to suppress it, that I thought it would never get into circulation. How it has leaked out I cannot think. But since the occasion never arose for my having a word of dispute with him, and since it appears to me to be more carelessly written than my other speeches, I think it might be maintained not to be by me. Pray look after this if you think I can do anything to remedy the mischief; but if my ruin is inevitable, I don't so much care about it. I am still lying idle in the same place, without conversation, without being able to think. Though, as you say, I have intimated to you my desire that you should come to me, yet it is now clear to me that you are doing me useful service where you are, but could not give me even a word of relief here. I cannot write any more, nor have I anything to say: I am rather waiting to hear from you all. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a>, 17 July. </p>                        </div>

The elections, I presume, are over; and when they were over you say that he was of opinion that my Case should be mooted. If I seem foolish to you for entertaining hopes, it is at your bidding that I do so: yet I know that you have in your letters been usually inclined rather to Check me and my hopes. Now pray write distinctly what your view is. I know that I have fallen into this distress from numerous errors of my own.

I resolved to remain there until I heard from you on the subject mentioned in your last letter, namely, that there was going to be some motion made in the senate on my case immediately after the elections, and that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had told you so. Wherefore, as the elections are over and I have no letter from you, I shall consider it as though you had written to say that nothing has come of it, and I shall not feel annoyed at having been buoyed up by a hope which did not keep me long in suspense. But the movement, which you said in your letter that you foresaw as likely to be to my advantage, people arriving here tell me will not occur. My sole remaining hope is in the tribunes-designate: and if I wait to see how that turns out, you will have no reason to think of me as having been wanting to my own cause or the wishes of my friends. As to your constantly finding fault with me for being so overwhelmed by my misfortune, you ought to pardon me when you see that I have sustained a more crushing blow than anyone you have ever seen or heard of. As to your saying that you are told that my intellect in even affected by grief, that is not so; my intellect is quite sound. Oh that it had been as much so in the hour of danger! when I found those, to whom I thought my safety was the dearest object of their life, most bitterly and unfeelingly hostile: who, when they saw that I had somewhat lost my balance from fear, left nothing undone which malice and treachery could suggest in giving me the final push, to my utter ruin. Now, as I must go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>, where I shall get letters more rarely, I beg you to write me word all the more carefully of everything you may think I ought to know.

III, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) THESSALONICA, 17 AUGUST: ON the 13th of August I received four letters from you: one in which you urge me in a tone of reproof to be less weak; a second, in which you say that <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>'s freedman has told you about my anxiety and leanness; a third, in which you describe the proceedings in the senate; a fourth on the subject of <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s assurances to you as to the friendly feelings of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. To the first my answer is this: though I do grieve, yet I keep all my mental faculties, and it is precisely that which vexes me — I have no opportunity and no one with whom to employ so sound an intellect. For if you cannot find yourself separated from one individual like myself without sorrow, what do you think must be my case, who am deprived both of you and of everyone else? And if you, while still in possession of all your rights, miss me, to what an extent do you think those rights are missed by me? I will not enumerate the things of which I have been despoiled, not only because you are not ignorant of them, but also lest I should reopen my own sorrow. I only assert this, that never did anyone in an unofficial position possess such great advantages, or fall into such great miseries. Moreover, lapse of time not only does not soften this grief, it even enhances it. For other sorrows are softened by age, this one cannot but be daily increased both by my sense of present misery and the recollection of my past life. For it is not only property or friends that I miss, but myself. For what am I? But I will not allow myself either to wring your soul with my complaints, or to place my hands too often on my wounds. For as to your defence of those whom I said had been jealous of me, and among them <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, I indeed think that lie was so far removed from that crime, that I am above all things sorry that the pretended zeal of others had more influence with me than his honesty. As for your excuses for the others, they ought to be excused in my eyes if they are so in yours. But all this is an old story now. <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>'s freedman, I think, spoke without any real sincerity. In the senate you say that the debate was satisfactory. But what about <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>? Hasn't he read that speech? I can't make out how it got into circulation! But <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, in describing the proceedings of the same day, does not speak so highly of <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. But he may be omitting something; I know you have certainly not written anything except what actually occurred. <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s talk gives me some hope of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and would that <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a> himself would throw himself into the cause! Which he certainly will do both of his own accord and under pressure from you For myself if fortune ever grants me the enjoyment of you all and of my country I will at least take care that you shall above all the rest of my friends, have cause to be glad and I will so discharge all the duties of affection and friendship, which (to confess the truth) have not heretofore been conspicuous that you shall regard me as restored to yourself as much as to my brother and my children. If I have in any way sinned in my con duct to you, or rather since I have done so pardon me For I have sinned more grievously against myself. And I do not write this to you because I know you not to feel deeply for my misfortune: but certainly if it had been a matter of obligation with you, and had always been so, to love me as much as you do and have done, you would never have allowed me to lack that judgment with which you are so well supplied, nor would you have allowed me to be persuaded that the passing of the bill for the colleges was to our advantage. But you did nothing but weep over my sorrow, as though you were my second self. This was indeed a sign of your affection: but what might have been done, if I had earned it at your hands — the spending by you of days and nights in thinking out the Course I ought to have pursued — that was omitted, owing to my own culpable imprudence, not yours. Now if, I don't say you only, but if there had been anyone to urge me, when alarmed at <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s ungenerous answer, not to adopt that most degrading course — and you are the person that, above all others, could have done it — I should either have died honourably, or we should have been living today triumphant. In this you must forgive me. For I find much greater fault with myself, and only call you in question afterwards, as at once my second self and the sharer in my error; and, besides, if I am ever restored, our mistake will seem still less in my eyes, and to you at least I shall be endeared by your own kindness, since there is none on my side. There is something in the suggestion you mentioned as having been made in your conversation with <a href=/people/2860 target=_blank>Culleo</a> as to a privilegium, but by far the better course is to have the law repealed. For if no one vetoes it, what course can be safer? But if anyone is found to prohibit its passing, he will be equally able to veto a decree of the senate. Nor is there need for the repeal of anything else. For the previous law did not touch me: and if, on its publication, I had chosen to speak in its favour, or to ignore it, as it ought to have been ignored, it could not have done me any harm at all. It was at this point first that my judgment failed to assist me, nay, even did me harm. Blind, blind, I say, was I in laying aside my senator's toga, and in entreating the people; it was a fatal step to take before some attack had been begun upon me by name. But I am harping on the past: it is, however, for the purpose of advising you, if any action is to be taken, not to touch that law, in which there are many provisions in the interests of the people. But it is foolish for me to be laying down rules as to what you are to do and how. I only wish that something may be done! And it is on that point that your letter displays much reserve: I presume, to prevent my being too much agitated by despair. For what action do you see possible to be taken, or in what way? Through the senate? But you yourself told me that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> had fixed upon the doorpost of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> a certain clause in the law, that it might neither be put to the house nor mentioned. How could <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, therefore, say that he would bring it before the house? How came it about also that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> held his tongue, when those you mention in your letter both spoke on the subject and demanded that a motion should be brought in? But if you go to the people — can it be carried except with the unanimous approval of the tribunes? What about my property? What about my house? Will it be possible to have it restored? Or, if that cannot, how can I be? Unless you see these difficulties on the way to be solved, what is the hope to which you invite me? But if, again, there is no hope, what sort of life is there for me? So I await at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406229PThs class=place long=22.9555 lat=40.6426>Thessalonica</a> the gazette of the proceedings of the 1st of August, in accordance with which I shall decide whether to take refuge on your estate, in order at once to avoid seeing people I don't want to see, to see you, according to your letter, and to be nearer at hand in case of any motion being made (and this I understand is in accordance with your view and that of my brother Quintus), or to depart for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404279UCyz class=place long=27.8878 lat=40.3895>Cyzicus</a>. Now, my dear <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, since you imparted to me none of your wisdom in time to save me, either because you had made up your mind that I had judgment enough of my own, or that you owed me nothing beyond being by my side; and since, betrayed, beguiled, and hurried into a snare as I was, I neglected all my defences, abandoned and left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, which was everywhere on the qui vive to defend me, and surrendered myself and mine into the hands of enemies while you looked on and said nothing, though, even if you were not my superior in mental power, you were at least in less of a fright: now, if you can, raise the fallen, and in that way assist me But if every avenue is barred, take care that I know that also, and cease at length either to scold me or to offer your kindly-meant consolations. If I had meant to impeach your good faith, I should not have chosen your roof, of all others, to which to trust myself: it is my own folly that I blame for having thought that your love for me was exactly what I could have wished it to be: for if that had been so, you would have displayed the same good faith, but greater circumspection; at least, you would have held me back when plunging headlong into ruin, and would not have had to encounter the labours which you are now enduring in saving the wrecks of my fortunes. Wherefore do be careful to look into, examine thoroughly, and write fully everything that occurs, and resolve (as I am sure you do) that I shall be some one, since I cannot now be the man I was and the man I might have been; and lastly, believe that in this letter it is not you, but myself that I have accused. If there are any people to whom you think that letters ought to be delivered in my name, pray compose them and see them delivered. </p>                        </div>

III, 17) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) THESSALONICA, 4 SEPTEMBER: News of my brother Quintus of an invariably gloomy nature reached me from the 3rd of June up to the 29th of August. On that day, however, Livineius, a freedman of Lucius <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a>, came to me by the direction of <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a> himself. He announced that absolutely no notice whatever had been given of a prosecution, but that there had, nevertheless, been some talk about the son of C. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. He also brought me a letter from my brother Quintus. But next day Came the slaves of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, who brought me a letter from you not so positive in regard to this alarm as the Conversation of Livineius had been. I am rendered very anxious in the midst of my own endless distress, and the more so as <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> has the trial of the Case. As to other circumstances mentioned in the same letter by you in Connexion with my hopes, I understand that things are going less well than other people represent them. I, however, since we are now not far from the time at which the matter will be decided, will either go to your house or will still remain somewhere in this neighbourhood. My brother writes me word that his interests are being supported by you more than by anyone else. Why should I urge you to do what you are already doing? or offer you thanks which you do not expect? I only pray that fortune may give us the opportunity of enjoying our mutual affection in security. I am always very anxious to get your letters, in which I beg you not to be afraid of your minuteness boring me, or your plain speaking giving me pain. </p>                        </div>

Accordingly, I resolved to go to your house in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, not because the natural features of the country mattered to me, shunning as I do the light of day altogether, but because it will be most grateful to my feelings to set out from a harbour of yours to my restoration; and, if that restoration is denied me, there is no place where I shall with greater ease either support this most wretched existence or (which is much better) rid myself of it. I shall be in a small society: I shall shake off the crowd. Your letters have never raised me to such a pitch of hope as those of others; and yet my hopes have always been less warm than your letters. Nevertheless, since a beginning has been made in the case, of whatever sort and from whatever motive, I will not disappoint the sad and touching entreaties of my best and only brother, nor the promises of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> and others, nor the hopes of my most afflicted wife, nor the entreaties of my most unhappy <a href=/people/2948 target=_blank>Tulliola</a>, as well as your own loyal letter. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> will furnish me with a road to restoration or to that other alternative mentioned above.

That this is now the case, and that your uncle has done what he ought to have done, I approve in the strongest manner possible: I will say I am glad, when circumstances shall admit of my using such a word. Ah me! how well everything would have been going if my own spirit, my own judgment, and the good faith of those on whom I relied had not failed me! But I won't review these circumstances lest I increase my sorrow. Yet I feel sure that it occurs to your mind what a life ours was, how delightful, how dignified. To recover this, in the name of fortune, bestow all your energies, as I know you do, and take care that I keep the birthday of my return in your delightful house with you and my family. For this hope and expectation, though now put before me as being very strong, I yet wished to wait in your home in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>; but my letters are such as to make me think it better not to be in the same neighbourhood.

Under the general act of restoration, if only that is accorded me, everything will be included, of which I care for nothing more than for my house. But I don't give you any precise injunction, I trust myself wholly to your affection and honour. I am very glad to hear that you have extricated yourself from every embarrassment in view of so large an inheritance. As to your promise to employ your means in securing my restoration, though I am in all points assisted by you above all others, yet I quite see what a support that is, and I fully understand that you are undertaking and can carry on many departments of my cause, and do not need to be asked to do so. You tell me not to suspect that your feelings have been at all affected by acts of commission or omission on my part towards you — well, I will obey you and will get rid of that anxiety; yet I shall owe you all the more from the fact that your kind consideration for me has been on a higher level than mine for you. Please tell me in your letters whatever you see, whatever you make out, what-ever is being done in my case, and exhort all your friends to help in promoting my recall. The bill of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> does not show sufficient regard for my dignity or sufficient caution.

III, 23) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) DYRRACHIUM, 29 NOVEMBER: On the 26th of November I received three letters from you, one dated 25th of October, in which you exhort me to await the month of January with a good heart, and write at length on such topics as you think tend to encourage my hopes — as to the zeal of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, the goodwill of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, and the general policy of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. In the second letter, contrary to your usual custom, you append no date, but give sufficient indication of the time of its writing. For the law having been published by the eight tribunes, you mention that you wrote this letter on the very same day, that is, the 29th of October, and you say what good you think that publication has done. In regard to which, if my restoration is to be despaired of along with this law, I would have you think in your affection for me that my fruitless exertions are pitiable rather than foolish: but if there is any ground for hope, try and secure that my cause may be hereafter supported with greater attention to details by the new magistrates. For this bill of the old tribunes had three clauses, of which the one relating to my return was carelessly drafted. For nothing is restored to me except my citizenship and senatorial rank: which, in the circumstances of my position, suffices me, but it does not escape your observation what special provisions will have to be made, and in what manner. The second clause is the usual one — If anything be done in virtue of this law against other laws. But observe, my dear <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, what the object of the third clause is, and by whom it has been put in. For you know that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> provided that it should be scarcely possible, or rather altogether impossible, for his law to be deprived of validity either by senate or people. But you must see that the penal provisions of such laws as are repealed have never been observed. For in that case hardly any law could be repealed at all — for there is no law which does not hedge itself in by trying to make repeal difficult — but when a law is repealed, so is the clause meant to prevent its repeal. Now, though this is in truth the case, since it has been the universal doctrine and practice, our eight tribunes introduced the following clause: If any provision is contained in this bill which, in view of existing laws or plebiscites (i.e., <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s law), it is not lawful without incurring penalty, now or heretofore, whether to publish, repeal, amend, or supersede, or whereby he who has so published or amended would be liable to penalty or fine — such provision is not enacted by this law. And observe that this contingency did not touch the case of those eight tribunes, for they were not bound by a law emanating from their own body. Which makes one the more suspicious of some evil intention, since they have added a clause which did not affect themselves, but was against my interests: so that the new tribunes, if they happened to be somewhat timid, would think it still more necessary to employ the clause. And <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> did not fail to notice this. For he said in the public meeting of November the third, that by this clause a limit to their legal powers was laid down for the tribunes-designate; and yet it cannot escape your notice that in no law is there a clause of the sort: whereas, if it had been necessary, everybody would have employed it in repealing a law. How this point came to escape <a href=/people/9894 target=_blank>Ninnius</a> and the rest, pray find out, and who introduced the clause, and how it was that the eight tribunes did not hesitate to bring my case before the senate — which implies that they did not think that clause of the law binding — and were yet so cautious in their proposal for its repeal, as to be afraid (though not personally liable) of what need not be taken into Consideration, even by those who are bound by the law. This clause I would not have the new tribunes propose; however, let them only carry something, no matter what: I shall be content with the single clause recalling me, so long only as the business is done. I have for some time been feeling ashamed of writing at such length; for I fear by the time you read this it will be all up with any hopes, so that this minute criticism of mine may seem pitiable to you and ridiculous to others. But if there is any ground for hope, pray look at the law which Visellius drafted for T. <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a>. I like it very much: for that of our friend <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, which you say has your approbation, I don't like. The third letter is dated 12th of November, in which you explain with wisdom and care what the circumstances are which seem to cause a postponement of my affair, and about <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and the rest. Accordingly, I beg you, if there is any hope that the matter can be settled by the zeal of the loyalists, by the exertion of influence, and by getting numbers on our side, to endeavour to break through all difficulties at a rush, to throw your whole weight into the attempt, and incite others to do the same. But if, as I perceive from your conjectures as well as my own, there is no hope left, I beg and implore you to cherish my brother Quintus, whom I to our mutual misery have ruined, and not allow him to do anything to himself which would be to the detriment of your sister's son. My little <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, to whom, poor boy! I leave nothing but prejudice and the blot upon my name, pray protect to the best of your power. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, that most afflicted of women, sustain by your kindness. I shall start for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> as soon as I have received news of the first days of the new tribunate.

III, 24) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) DYRRACHIUM, 10 DECEMBER: When, some time ago, I received letters from you all stating that with your consent the vote for the expenses of the consular provinces had been taken, though I was nervous as to the result of the measure, I yet hoped that you saw some good reason for it beyond what I could see: but when I was informed by word of mouth and by letters that this policy of yours was strongly censured, I was much disturbed, because the hope which I had cherished, faint as it was, seemed completely destroyed. For if the tribunes are angry with us, what hope can there be? And, indeed, they seem to have reason to be angry, since they, who had undertaken my cause, have not been consulted on the measure; while by your assenting to it they have been deprived of all the legitimate influence of their office: and that though they profess that it was for my sake that they wished to have the vote for the outfit of the consuls under their control, not in order to curtail their freedom of action, but in order to attach them to my cause: that as things stand now, supposing the consuls to choose to take part against me, they can do so without let or hindrance, but if they wish to do anything in my favour they are powerless if the tribunes object. For as to what you say in your letter, that, if your party had not consented, they would have obtained their object by a popular vote — that would have been impossible against the will of the tribunes. So I fear, on the one hand, that I have lost the favour of the tribunes; and on the other, even supposing that favour to remain, that the tie has been lost by which the consuls were to be attached. Added to this is another disadvantage, the abandonment of the weighty resolution — as, indeed, it was reported to me — that the senate should pass no decree until my case had been decided, and that, too, in the case of a measure which was not only not urgent, but even contrary to custom and unprecedented. For I think there is no precedent for voting the provincial outfit of magistrates when still only designate: so that, since in a matter like this the firm line on which my cause had been taken up has been infringed, there is now no reason why any decree should not be passed. It is not surprising that those friends to whom the question was referred assented, for it was difficult to find anyone to express an opinion openly against proposals so advantageous to two consuls. It would in any case have been difficult not to be complaisant to such a warm friend as <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, or to <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> after the exceedingly kind way in which he put aside his quarrel with me. But I fear that, while failing to keep a hold on them, we have lost the tribunes.

IV, 1) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (SEPTEMBER) DIRECTLY I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and there was anyone to whom I could safely intrust a letter for you, I thought the very first thing I ought to do was to Congratulate you in your absence on my return. For I knew, to speak candidly, that though in giving me advice you had not been more courageous or far-seeing than myself, nor — considering my devotion to you in the past — too careful in protecting me from disaster, yet that you — though sharing in the first instance in my mistake, or rather madness, and in my groundless terror — had nevertheless been deeply grieved at our separation, and had bestowed immense pains, zeal, care, and labour in securing my return. Accordingly, I can truly assure you of this, that in the midst of supreme joy and the most gratifying congratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happiness to the brim is the sight of you, or rather your embrace; and if I ever forfeit that again, when I have once got possession of it, and if, too, I do not exact the full delights of your charming society that have fallen into arrear in the past, I shall certainly consider myself unworthy of this renewal of my good fortune. In regard to my political position, I have resumed what I thought there would be the utmost difficulty in recovering — my brilliant standing at the bar, my influence in the senate, and a popularity with the loyalists even greater than I desired. In regard, however, to my private property — as to which you are well aware to what an extent it has been crippled, scattered, and plundered — I am in great difficulties, and stand in need, not so much of your means (which I look upon as my own), as of your advice for collecting and restoring to a sound state the fragments that remain. For the present, though I believe everything finds its way to you in the letters of your friends, or even by messengers and rumour, yet I will write briefly what I think you would like to learn from my letters above all others. On the 4th of August I started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>, the very day on which the law about me was carried. I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 5th of August. There my dear <a href=/people/2948 target=_blank>Tulliola</a> met me on what was her own birthday, which happened also to be the name-day of the colony of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> and of the temple of <a href=/people/2936 target=_blank>Safety</a>, near your house. This coincidence was noticed and celebrated with warm congratulations by the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. On the 8th of August, while still at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, I learnt by a letter from Quintus that the law had been passed at the comilta centuriata with a surprising enthusiasm on the part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible influx of voters from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. I then commenced my journey, amidst the compliments of the men of highest consideration at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and was met at every point by legates bearing congratulations. My arrival in the neighbourhood of the city was the signal for every soul of every order known to my nomenclator Coming out to meet me, except those enemies who could not either dissemble or deny the fact of their being such. On my arrival at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125FPCp class=place long=12.4895 lat=41.8847>Porta Capena</a>, the steps of the temples were already thronged from top to bottom by the populace; and while their congratulations were displayed by the loudest possible applause, a similar throng and similar applause accompanied me right up to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, and in the forum and on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> itself there was again a wonderful crowd. Next day, in the senate, that is, the 5th of September, I spoke my thanks to the senators. Two days after that-there having been a very heavy rise in the price of corn, and great crowds having flocked first to the theatre and then to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>, shouting out, at the instigation of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, that the scarcity of corn was my doing — meetings of the senate being held on those days to discuss the corn question, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> being called upon to undertake the management of its supply in the common talk not only of the plebs, but of the aristocrats also, and being himself desirous of the commission, when the people at large called upon me by name to support a decree to that effect, I did so, and gave my vote in a carefully-worded speech. The other consulars, except <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>, having absented themselves on the ground that they could not vote with safety to themselves, a decree of the senate was passed in the sense of my motion, namely, that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should be appealed to to undertake the business, and that a law should be proposed to that effect. This decree of the senate having been publicly read, and the people having, after the senseless and new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded the mention of my name, I delivered a speech. All the magistrates present, except one praetor and two tribunes, called on me to speak. Next day a full senate, including all the consulars, granted everything that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> asked for. Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the list, and said that he should regard me in all things as a second self. The consuls drew up a law by which complete control over the corn-supply for five years throughout the whole world was given to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. A second law is drawn up by <a href=/people/5790 target=_blank>Messius</a>, granting him power over all money, and adding a fleet and army, and an impedum in the provinces superior to that of their governors. After that our consular law seems moderate indeed: that of <a href=/people/5790 target=_blank>Messius</a> is quite intolerable. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> professes to prefer the former; his friends the latter. The consulars led by <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> murmur: I hold my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet given no answer in regard to my house. If they annul the consecration I shall have a splendid site. The consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, will value the cost of the building that stood upon it; but if the pontifices decide otherwise, they will pull down the <a href=/people/4124 target=_blank>Clodian</a> building, give out a contract in their own name (for a temple), and value to me the cost of a site and house. So our affairs are For happy though but ill, for ill not worst. In regard to money matters I am, as you know, much embarrassed. Besides, there are certain domestic troubles, which I do not intrust to writing. My brother Quintus I love as he deserves for his eminent qualities of loyalty, virtue, and good faith. I am longing to see you, and beg you to hasten your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the benefit of your advice. I am on the threshold, as it were, of a second life. Already certain persons who defended me in my absence begin to nurse a secret grudge at me now that I am here, and to make no secret of their jealousy. I want you very much. </p>                        </div>

IV, 2) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME (OCTOBER) If by any chance you get letters less frequently from me than from others, I beg you not to put it down to my negligence, or even to my engagements; for though they are very heavy, there can be none sufficient to stop the course of our mutual affection and of the attention I owe to you. The fact is that, since my return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, this is only the second time that I have been told of anyone to whom I could deliver a letter, and accordingly this is my second letter to you. In my former I described the reception I had on my return, what my political position was, and how my affairs were For happy though but ill, for ill not worst. The despatch of that letter was followed by a great controversy about my house. I delivered a speech before the pontifices on the 29th of September. I pleaded my cause with care, and if I ever was worth anything as a speaker, or even if I never was on any other occasion, on this one at any rate my indignation at the business, and the importance of it, did add a Certain vigour to my style. Accordingly, the rising generation must not be left without the benefit of this speech, which I shall send you all the same, even if you don't want it. The decree of the pontifices was as follows: If neither by order of the people nor vote of the plebs the party alleging that he had dedicated had been appointed by name to that function, nor by order of the people or vote of the plebs had been commanded to do so, we are of opinion that the part of the site in question may be restored to M. <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Tullius</a> without violence to religion. Upon this I was at once congratulated — for no one doubted that my house was thereby adjudged to me — when all on a sudden that fellow mounts the platform to address a meeting, invited to speak by <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and announces at once to the people that the pontifices had decided in his favour, but that I was endeavouring to take forcible possession; he exhorts them to follow himself and <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> to defend their own shrine of Liberty. Hereupon, when even those Credulous hearers partly wondered and partly laughed at the fellow's mad folly, I resolved not to go near the place until such time as the consuls by decree of the senate had given out the contract for restoring the colonnade of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>. On the 1st of October there was a full meeting of the senate. All the pontilices who were senators were invited to attend, and <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a>, who is a great admirer of mine, being called on to speak first, asked them what was the purport of their decree. Then M. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, speaking for all his colleagues, answered that the pontifices were judges of a question of religion, the senate of the validity of a law: that he and his colleagues had given a decision on a point of religion; in the senate they would with the other senators decide on the law. Accordingly, each of them, when asked in their proper order for their opinion, delivered long arguments in my favour. When it came to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s turn, he wished to talk out the day, and he went on endlessly; however, after he had spoken for nearly three hours, he was forced by the loud expression of the senate's disgust to finish his speech at last. On the decree in accordance with the proposal of <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a> passing the senate against a minority of one, <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a> interposed his veto. At once both consuls referred the question of <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a>'s veto to the senate. After some very resolute speeches had been delivered — that it was the decision of the senate that the house should be restored to me: that a contract should be given out for the colonnade of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>: that the resolution of the house should be supported by all the magistrates: that if any violence occurred, the senate would consider it to be the fault of the magistrate who vetoed the decree of the senate — <a href=/people/1640 target=_blank>Serranus</a> became thoroughly frightened, and Cornicinus repeated his old farce: throwing off his toga, he flung himself at his son-in-law's feet. The former demanded a night for consideration. They would not grant it: for they remembered the 1st of January. It was, however, at last granted with difficulty on my interposition. Next day the decree of the senate was passed which I send you. Thereupon the consuls gave out a contract for the restoration of the colonnade of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>: the contractors immediately cleared that portico of his away to the satisfaction of all. The buildings of my house the consuls, by the advice of their assessors, valued at 2,000,000 sesterces. The rest was valued very stingily. My <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa at 500,000 sesterces: my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> at 250,000 sesterces — an estimate loudly exclaimed against not only by all the best men, but even by the common people. You Will say, What was the reason? They for their part say it was my modesty — because I would neither say no, nor make any violent expostulation. But that is not the real cause: for that indeed in itself would have been in my favour. But, my dear <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, those very same men, I tell you, of whom you are no more ignorant than myself, having clipped my wings, are unwilling that they should grow again to their old size. But, as I hope, they are already growing again. Only come to me! But this, I fear, may be retarded by the visit of your and my friend <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>. Having now heard the actual course of public business, let me inform you of what I have in my thoughts besides. I have allowed myself to be made legatus to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, but only on condition that nothing should stand in the way of my being entirely free either to stand, if I choose, for the censorship — if the next consuls hold a censorial election — or to assume a votive commission in connexion with nearly any fanes or sacred groves. For this is what falls in best with our general policy and my particular occasions. But I wished the power to remain in my hands of either standing for election, or at the beginning of the summer of going out of town: and meanwhile I thought it not disadvantageous to keep myself before the eyes of the citizens who had treated me generously. Well, such are my plans in regard to public affairs; my domestic affairs are very intricate and difficult. My town house is being built: you know how much expense and annoyance the repair of my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=demonym long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formian</a> villa occasions me, which I can neither bear to relinquish nor to look at. I have advertised my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> property for sale; I don't much care for a suburban residence. The liberality of friends has been exhausted in a business which brought me nothing but dishonour: and this you perceived though absent, as did others on the spot, by whose zeal and wealth I could easily have obtained all I wanted, had only my supporters allowed it. In this respect I am now in serious difficulty. Other causes of anxiety are somewhat more of the tacenda kind. My brother and daughter treat me with affection. I am looking forward to seeing you. </p>                        </div>

IV, 3) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME, 24 NOVEMBER: I am very well aware that you long to know what is going on here, and also to know it from me, not because things done before the eyes of the whole world are better realized when narrated by my band than when reported to you by the pens or lips of others, but because it is from my letters that you get what you want — a knowledge of my feelings in regard to the occurrences, and what at such a juncture is the state of my mind, or, in a word, the conditions in which I am living. On the 3rd of November the workmen were driven from the site of my house by armed ruffians: the porticus Catuli, which was being rebuilt on a contract given out by the consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, and had nearly reached the roof, was battered down: the house of my brother Quintus was first smashed with volleys of stones thrown from my site, and then set on fire by order of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, firebrands having been thrown into it in the sight of the whole town, amidst loud exclamations of indignation and sorrow, I will not say of the loyalists — for I rather think there are none — but of simply every human being. That madman runs riot: thinks after this mad prank of nothing short of murdering his opponents: canvasses the city street by street: makes open offers of freedom to slaves. For the fact is that up to this time, while trying to avoid prosecution, he had a case, difficult indeed to support, and obviously bad, but still a case: he might have denied the facts, he might have shifted the blame on others, he might even have pleaded that some part of his proceedings had been legal. But after such wrecking of buildings, incendiaries, and wholesale robberies as these, being abandoned by his supporters, he hardly retains on his side <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> the marshal, or <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a>; takes slaves into his confidence; sees that, even if he openly assassinates everyone he wishes to, he will not have a worse case before a court of law than he has at present. Accordingly, on the 11th of November, as I was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me with his gang. There were shouts, stone-throwing, brandishing of clubs and swords, and all this without a moment's warning. I and my party stepped aside into <a href=/people/5274 target=_blank>Tettius</a> Damio's vestibule: those accompanying me easily prevented his roughs from getting in. He might have been killed himself. But I am now on a system of cure by regimen: I am tired of surgery. The fellow, seeing that what everybody called for was not his prosecution but his instant execution, has since made all your Catilines seem models of respectability. For on the 12th of November he tried to storm and set fire to <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s house, I mean the one on Germalus: and so openly was this done, that at eleven o'clock in the morning he brought men there armed with shields and with their swords drawn, and others with lighted torches. He had himself occupied the house of P. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> as his headquarters from which to Conduct the assault upon <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s. Thereupon Q. <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> led out some gallant fellows from <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s other house (the Anniana): killed the most notorious bravoes of all <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s gang: wanted to kill <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> himself; but my gentleman took refuge in the inner part of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s house. The next thing was a meeting of the senate on the 14th. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> stayed at home: <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a> was splendid: all were keen. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> talked the business out by an obstructive speech, aided by <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and also, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! by your friend on whose firmness you wrote me such a wonderfully true letter! <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> was fuming. Afterwards the fellow vows vengeance on the city if his election is stopped. <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a>'s resolution having been exposed for public perusal (he had read it from a written copy, and it embraced our entire case — the prosecution was to include his violent proceedings on the site of my house, his arson, his assault on me personally, and was to take place before the elections), he put up a notice that he intended to watch the sky during all comitial days. Public speeches of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> disorderly, of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> hot-beaded, of Publius stark mad. The upshot, however, was that, had not <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> served his notice of bad omens in the campus, the elections would have been held. On the 19th of November <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> arrived on the campus before midnight with a large company. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, though he had picked gangs of runaway slaves, did not venture into the campus. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> stopped there till midday, to everybody's great delight and his own infinite credit: the movement of the three brethren ended in their own disgrace; their violence was crushed, their madness made ridiculous. However, <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> demands that the obstructive notice should be served on him next day in the forum: there was no need to come to the campus before daybreak: he would be in the comitium at the first hour of the day. Accordingly, on the 20th <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> Came to the forum before sunrise. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> at the first sign of dawn was stealthily hurrying to the campus, I had almost said by by-lanes: <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> catches our friend up between the groves and serves his notice. The latter returned greeted with loud and insulting remarks by Q. <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a>. The 21st was a market day. For two days no public meeting. I am writing this letter on the 23rd at three o'clock in the morning. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> is already in possession of the campus. The candidate <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> is snoring so loud that I can hear him next door. I am told that <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s vestibule is completely deserted: there are a few ragged fellows there and a canvas lantern. His party complains that I am the adviser of the whole business: they little know the Courage and wisdom of that hero! His gallantry is astonishing. Some recent instances of his superhuman excellence I pass over; but the upshot is this: I don't think the election will take place. I think Publius will be brought to trial by <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> — unless he is killed first. If he once puts himself in his way in a riot, I can see that he will be killed by <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> himself. The latter has no scruple about doing it; he avows his intention; he isn't at all afraid of what happened to me, for he will never listen to the advice of a jealous and faithless friend, nor trust a feeble aristocrat. In spirit, at any rate, I am as vigorous as in my zenith, or even more so; in regard to money I am crippled. However, the liberality of my brother I have, in spite of his protests, repaid (as the state of my finances compelled) by the aid of my friends, that I might not be drained quite dry myself. What line of policy to adopt in regard to my position as a whole, I cannot decide in your absence: wherefore make haste to town. </p>                        </div>

Do you think that there is anyone by whom I prefer to have what I write read and approved of before yourself? Why, then, did I send it to anyone before you? I was pressed by the man to whom I sent it, and had no copy. And — well! I am nibbling at what I must, after all, swallow — my recantation did seem to me a trifle discreditable! But good-bye to straightforward, honest, and high-minded policy! One could scarcely believe the amount of treachery there is in those leaders of the state, as they wish to be, and might be, if they had any principle of honour in them. I had felt it, known it-taken in, abandoned, and cast aside by them, as I had been! and yet my purpose still was to stick by them in politics. They were the same men as they ever had been. At last, on your advice, my eyes have been opened. You will say that your advice only extended to action, not to writing also. The truth is that I wanted to bind myself to this new combination, that I might have no excuse for slipping back to those who, even at a time when I could claim their Compassion, never cease being jealous of me. However, I kept within due limits in my subject, when I did put pen to paper. I shall launch out more copiously if he shows that he is glad to receive it, and those make wry faces who are angry at my possessing the villa which once belonged to <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, without reflecting that I bought it from <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>: who say that I ought not to have built a town house, and declare that I ought to have sold. But what is all this to the fact that, when I have delivered senatorial speeches in agreement with their own views, their chief pleasure has yet been that I spoke contrary to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s wishes? Let us have an end of it. Since those who have no power refuse me their affection, let us take care to secure the affection of those who have power. You will say, I could have wished that you had done so before. I know you did wish it, and that I have made a real ass of myself. But now the time has Come to show a little affection for myself, since I can get none from them on any terms. I am much obliged to you for frequently going to see my house. <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a> swallows up my money for travelling. <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> will go straight to your suburban villa.

My consolation is a miserable one, but still it is a consolation — that I do not grieve on his account: I don't mean in the sense of <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a> and your <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> friends, but, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, because he loved his country so deeply, that he seems to me to have been snatched away by a special favour of providence from its conflagration. For what could be more humiliating than the life we are living, especially mine? For as to yourself, though by nature a politician, you have yet avoided having any servitude peculiar to yourself: you merely come under an appellation common to us all. But!; who, if I say what I ought about the Republic, am looked on as mad, if what expediency dictates, as a slave, and if I say nothing, as utterly crushed and helpless — what must I be suffering? Suffer, indeed, I do, and all the more keenly that I cannot even show my pain without appearing ungrateful. Again: what if I should choose a life of inactivity and take refuge in the harbour of retired leisure? Impossible! Rather war and the camp Am I to serve in the ranks after refusing to be a general? I suppose I must. For I perceive you, too, think so, you whom I wish that I had always obeyed. All that is left to me now is, You have drawn <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Sparta</a>: make the best of it! But, by heavens, I can't: and I feel for <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>, who preferred a return to jail. However, in my present retirement I am thinking over how to express my rejection of the old policy, and when we meet you will strengthen me in it. I notice that you have written to me at frequent intervals, but I received all the letters at once. This circumstance increased my grief. For I had read three to begin with, in which the report of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> was that he was a little better. Then came the thunderbolt of the fourth. But it is not he, as I said, who is to be pitied, but we who are so callous as to live on. You remind me to write that essay on <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>: I have digressed into other subjects, but have not forgotten your charge. But, by heaven, at the first line I shrank from the task, lest I, who seem to have acted foolishly in resenting foolishly rendering his injurious treatment of me conspicuous, his intemperate conduct as a friend, should once more be if I wrote anything; and at the same time lest my high morale, manifested in my actions, should be somewhat obscured in my writing, and this mode of taking satisfaction should seem to imply a certain instability. But we shall see. Only be sure to write me something as often as possible. I sent a letter to <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> asking him to write the history of my consulship: be sure you get it from him, for it is a very pretty bit of writing, and urge him to use despatch, and thank him for having written me an answer saying that he would do so.

He is not at all satisfied with himself, to judge from what he says — one is obliged to put in that proviso in his case. He thinks very little of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> as a province; talks a good deal about Spain — here, too, I must add, to judge from what he says, and, I think, his whole conversation requires that reservation, and to be ticketed as <a href=/people/2917 target=_blank>Phocylides</a> did his verses — καὶ τόδεφωκυλίδου. He expressed gratitude to you for undertaking to arrange the statues: towards myself he was, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, most effusively cordial. He even came to my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> house to call on me. However, the last thing he seemed to wish was that <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> should stand for the consulship: that is the very point on which I should like to hear what you know. I am much obliged by your saying that you will recommend my fame to <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>, and for your frequent inspection of my house. My brother Quintus has written to tell me that, as you have that dear boy, his son Quintus, staying with you, he intends coming to your house on the 7th of May. I left my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa on the 26th of April. That night I spent at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> with <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>.

Also I should like you to find out what this means: you can do so from <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> told me that he was expecting <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> villa on the 27th: that as soon as he arrived, they were going at once to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to settle accounts with the publicani. I asked, During the gladiatorial exhibitions? He answered, Before they were begun.

He sends compliments to you and all your party.  No bliss so great as knowing all that is.  Wherefore indulge my thirst for knowledge by telling what happened on the first and on the second day of the shows: what about the Censors, what about <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, what about that she — <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a> of the people? Finally, pray write me word what you are doing yourself. For, to tell the truth, revolutions don't give me so much pleasure as a letter from you. I took no one out of town with me except <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>: yet I am in no fear of wanting conversation — so delightful do I find that youth.

I found <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> there. I wish to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 17th. Why do I say wish? Rather I am forced to be so. <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s wedding. There is some idea of an election. Even supposing that to be confirmed, I am glad to have been absent from the wrangling debates which I am told have taken place in the senate. For I should either have defended him, which would have been against my opinion, or have deserted him whom I was bound to defend. But, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, describe to me to the utmost of your power those events, and the present state of politics, and how the consuls stand this bother. I am very ravenous for news, and, to tell you the truth, I feel no confidence in anything. Our friend <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a> indeed, people say, started in his official robes with less dignity than in the old times did L. <a href=/people/10991 target=_blank>Paullus</a>, at the same time of life as he is, and, like him, in his second consulship. What a sorry fellow! About my oratorical books, I have been working hard. They have been long in hand and much revised: you can get them copied.

IV, 16) (AND PART OF 17) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS OR ON HIS JOURNEY TO ASIA) ROME (? 24 JUNE) The bare fact of my letter being by the hand of an amanuensis will be a sign of the amount of my engagements. I have no fault to find with you as to the number of your letters, but most of them told me nothing except where you were, or at most showed by the fact that they Came from you that no harm had happened to you. Of this class of letters there were two which gave me very great pleasure, dated by you from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> almost at the same time: for I was anxious to know that you had had a favourable crossing. But this constant supply of your letters did not give me so much pleasure by the richness of their contents as by their frequency. The one which your guest, M. <a href=/people/5153 target=_blank>Paccius</a>, delivered to me was important and full of matter. I will therefore answer it. And this is the first thing I have to say: I have shown <a href=/people/5153 target=_blank>Paccius</a>, both by word and deed, what weight a recommendation from you has: accordingly, he is among my intimate friends, though unknown to me before. Now for the rest. <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a>, of whom you write, shall be got in somewhere, if I can but find a place for him. But you know the style of my Dialogues: just as in those On the Orator, which you praise to the skies, a mention of anyone by the interlocutors was impossible, unless he had been known to or heard of by them, so in the Dialogue on the Republic, which I have begun, I have put the discussion in the mouths of <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, <a href=/people/3662 target=_blank>Philus</a>, <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, and <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>. I have added two young men, Q. <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a> and P. <a href=/people/1250 target=_blank>Rutilius</a>, and the two sons-in-law of <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>, <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> and <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>. So I am thinking how (since I employ introductions to each book, as <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> does in what he calls his Exoterics) to contrive some pretext for naming your friend in a natural way, as I understand is your wish. May I only be enabled to carry out my attempt! For, as you cannot but observe, I have undertaken a subject wide, difficult, and requiring the utmost leisure — the very thing that, above all others, I lack. In those books which you commend you complain of the absence of <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> among the speakers. Well, I did not withdraw him without a set purpose, but I did exactly what that god of our idolatry, <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, did in his Republic. When <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> had come to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a> on a visit to <a href=/people/4337 target=_blank>Cephalus</a>, a wealthy and cheerful old man, during all the introductory conversation the old man takes part in the discussion; then, after having himself made a speech very much to the point, he says that he wants to go away to attend on the religious rites, and does not return again. I believe <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> hardly thought that it would be quite natural, if he kept a man of that age any longer in a conversation so protracted. I thought that I was bound to be still more careful in the case of <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, who was at the age and with the broken health as you remember he then was, and who had enjoyed such high offices, that it was scarcely in accordance with etiquette for him to be staying several days in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>. Besides, the conversation in the first book was not unconnected with <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>'s special pursuits: the other books, as you know, contain a technical discussion. In such I was unwilling that that facetious veteran, as you know he was, should take part. As to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>'s business, which you mention, I will see to it. For the matter is quite clear, as you say, from the information supplied by Aurelianus, and in managing it I shall have also an opportunity of glorifying myself in my <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>'s eyes. I am supporting <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>: for I know that it gratifies you, and I am careful that he should understand that to be the case. But do you know the sort of man he is? Though he has two such good-natured people to deal with, nothing can exceed his impracticability. Now as to what you ask about Gaius <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. You know that he was acquitted under the lex <a href=/people/4574 target=_blank>Junia</a> <a href=/people/3035 target=_blank>Licinia</a>: I have to tell you that he will be acquitted under the lex Fufia, and not so much to the satisfaction of his defenders as of his accusers. However, he has become reconciled to myself and <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> has had notice of prosecution by <a href=/people/464 target=_blank>Lucretius</a>. The 3rd of July is the day fixed for challenging his jurors. About <a href=/people/5930 target=_blank>Procilius</a> there are sinister rumours — but you know what the courts are. <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a> is on good terms with <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>. The senatorial decree which the present consuls have carried about the provinces — whoever henceforth, etc. — does not seem to me likely to have any effect. As to your question about <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>, I don't know what to say: I have never seen candidates so closely matched. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>'s means of support you know. <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> has had notice of prosecution from <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a>. If you ask me, no great feeling of sympathy for him has been roused. Still, his aedileship is remembered with some gratitude, and he has a certain hold on the country voters from the memory of his father. The two remaining plebeian candidates have compensating advantages which make them about equal: <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a> is strong in friends, and is farther supported by his very popular exhibition of gladiators; <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> finds favour with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s veterans and relies on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s client towns in Gaul. If this does not avail him, people think that some tribune will be found to push off the elections till <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> comes back, especially since <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> has been acquitted. I have answered your letter brought by <a href=/people/5153 target=_blank>Paccius</a>: now for the rest. From my brother's letter I gather surprising indications of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s affection for me, and they have been confirmed by a very cordial letter from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself. The result of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=demonym long=-1.5 lat=53>British</a> war is a source of anxiety. For it is ascertained that the approaches to the island are protected by astonishing masses of cliff. Moreover, it is now known that there isn't a pennyweight of silver in that island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves, among whom I don't suppose you can expect any instructed in literature or music. <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a> has almost brought his basilica in the forum to the roof, using the same columns as were in the ancient building: the part for which he gave out a contract he is building on the most magnificent scale. Need I say more? Nothing could be more gratifying or more to his glory than such a monument. Accordingly, the friends of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — I mean myself and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, though you burst with anger — have thought nothing of 60,000 sestertia for that monument, which you used to speak of in such high terms, in order to enlarge the forum and extend it right up to the Hall of Liberty. The claims of private owners could not be satisfied for less. We will make it a most glorious affair. For in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a> we are about to erect voting places for the comitia tributa, of marble and covered, and to surround them with a lofty colonnade a mile in circumference: at the same time the Villa Publica will also be connected with these erections. You will say: What good will this monument do me? But why should I trouble myself about that? I have told you all the news at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: for I don't suppose you want to know about the lustrum, of which there is now no hope, or about the trials which are being held under the (Cincian) law. Now allow yourself to be scolded, if you deserve it. For you say in the letter from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>, delivered to me by C. <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a>, that you think you will have to go to Asia. There did not, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, seem to me to be anything that made it matter in the least whether you did the business by agents or in person; or anything to make you go so often and so far from your friends. But I could have wished that I had urged. this on you before you had taken any step. For I certainly should have had some influence on you. As things are, I will suppress the rest of my scolding. May it only have some effect in hastening your return! The reason of my not writing oftener to you is the uncertainty I am in as to where you are or are going to be. However, I thought I ought to give this letter to a chance messenger, because be seemed to be likely to see you. Since you think you really will go to Asia, pray tell me by what time we may expect you back, and what you have done about <a href=/people/1942 target=_blank>Eutychides</a>. </p>                        </div>

For you never would have been willing, without the most urgent cause, to be so far from so many persons and things which you love so much, and which give you so much delight.

You say you desire something in the way of a letter from me: I have written, and, indeed, on many subjects — everything detailed like a journal — but, as I conjecture from your not having, as it seems, remained long in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, I suppose it has not reached you. Moreover, my letters to you are generally of such a kind, that I don't like to put them in anyone's hands, unless I can feel certain that he will deliver them to you. Now for affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. On the 4th of July Sufenas and <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> were acquitted, <a href=/people/5930 target=_blank>Procilius</a> condemned. From which we have learnt that our treble-distilled <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagites</a> care not a rush for bribery, elections, Interregnum, lese majeste, or, in fact, for the state generally; but that they would rather that a father of a family were not murdered on his own hearthstone — and even that preference not very decided. There were twenty-two votes for acquittal, twenty-nine for condemnation! Publius, no doubt by an eloquent peroration in his speech for the prosecution, had quickened the feelings of the jurors! Herbalus was in the case. and behaved as usual. I said never a word. For my little girl, who is unwell, was afraid of offending Publius's feelings. After this was over the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424129URea class=place long=12.8589 lat=42.402>Reate</a> conducted me to their <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399227LTem class=place long=22.576 lat=39.877>Tempe</a>, to plead their cause against the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426126UInt class=place long=12.6433 lat=42.5604>Interamna</a> before the consul and ten commissioners, because the <a href=/people/6043 target=_blank>Veline</a> Lake, which had been drained by <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> by cutting away the mountain, flowed into the Nar, by which means the famous <a href=/people/10189 target=_blank>Rosia</a> has been reclaimed from the swamp, though still fairly moist. I lived with <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, who took me also to visit Seven Waters. I returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 9th of July for the sake of <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>. I entered the theatre. At first I was greeted with loud and general applause — but don't take any notice of that, I was a fool to mention it — then I turned my attention to <a href=/people/292 target=_blank>Antiphon</a>. He had been manumitted before being brought on to the stage. Not to keep you in suspense, he bore away the palm. But there never was anything so dwarfish, so destitute of voice, so — - But keep this to yourself. However, in the <a href=/people/902 target=_blank>Andromache</a> he was just taller than <a href=/people/1868 target=_blank>Astyanax</a>: among the rest he had not one of his own height. You next ask about Arbuscula: she had a great success. The games were splendid and much liked. The wild-beast hunt was put off to a future occasion. Next follow me into the campus. Bribery is raging. and I a sign to you will tell. The rate of interest from being four per cent. on the 15th of July has gone up to eight per cent. You will say, Well, I don't mind that. What a man! What a citizen! <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> is supported by all <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s influence. The consuls have formed a coalition between him and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> (<a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a>) on terms which I dare not commit to paper. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> rages, remonstrates, backs <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, but whether only ostensibly or from the heart people don't feel sure. No one takes the lead: money reduces all to the same level. <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>'s chance is at a low ebb: not because he is wanting in spirit or friends, but because this coalition of the consuls, as well as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s opposition, stands in his way. I think the result will be a postponement of the elections. The tribunician candidates have taken an oath to conduct their canvass according to the direction of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. They have deposited with him 500 sestertia apiece, on condition that whoever <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> condemns should forfeit it, and that it should be paid over to his competitors. I write this the day before the elections are to take place. But on the 28th of July, if they have taken place, and if the letter-carrier has not started, I will write you an account of the whole comitia: and, if they are conducted without corruption, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> by himself will have been more efficacious than all laws and jurors put together. I have undertaken to defend <a href=/people/5790 target=_blank>Messius</a>, who has been recalled from his legation: for <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> had named him legatus to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> ordered his attendance in an edict. His jurors are to be from the tribes Pomptina, Velina, and Maecia. It is a sharp fight: however, it is going fairly well. After that I have to prepare myself for <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, then for <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>. Very high-sounding title — slips are being prepared for my speeches! Perhaps even the consuls-designate will be added to the list of my clients: and if <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> is not one of them, he will find himself in serious difficulties in this trial. Judging from my brother Quintus's letter, I suspect that by this time he is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a>. I await news of him with anxiety. We have certainly gained one advantage — many unmistakable indications enable us to feel sure that we are in the highest degree liked and valued by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Please give my compliments to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and beg and exhort him to come as soon as possible, that he may continue the instruction of my son and of myself as well. </p>                        </div>

IV, 17) (AND PARTS OF 16) TO ATTICUS (ABROAD) ROME, 1 OCTOBER: You think I imagine that I write more rarely to you than I used to do from having forgotten my regular habit and purpose, but the fact is that, perceiving your locality and journeys to be equally uncertain, I have never entrusted a letter to anyone — either for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, or Asia, or anywhere else — unless he was going expressly to you. For my letters are not of the sort to make their non-delivery a matter of indifference; they contain so many confidential secrets that I do not as a rule trust them even to an amanuensis, for fear of some jest leaking out in some direction or another. The consuls are in a blaze of infamy because Gaius <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, one of the candidates, read out in the senate a compact which he and his fellow candidate, <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a>, had made with the consuls — that both were to forfeit to the consuls 40 sestertia apiece (in Case they were themselves elected consuls), if they did not produce three augurs to depose that they had been present at the passing of a lex curiata, which, in fact, had not been passed; and two consulars to depose to having helped to draft a decree for furnishing the consular provinces, though there had not even been a meeting of the senate at all. As this compact was alleged not to have been a mere verbal one, but to have been drawn up with the sums to be paid duly entered, formal orders for payment, and written attestations of many persons, it was, on the suggestion of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, produced by <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, but with the names obliterated. It has made no difference to <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> — he had no character to lose! To the other consul it was a real knock-down blow, and he is, I assure you, a ruined man. <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, however, having thus dissolved the coalition, has lost all chance of election, and is by this time in a worse position than ever, because we are now informed that his revelation is strongly disapproved of by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Our friend <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and his fellow candidate, <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a>, have been very liberal to the people. Nothing can exceed their popularity. They are certain to be consuls. But the senate has passed a decree that a trial with closed doors should be held before the elections in respect to each of the candidates severally. by the panels already allotted to them all. The candidates are in a great fright. But certain jurors — among them <a href=/people/1513 target=_blank>Opimius</a>, Veiento, and Rantius — appealed to the tribunes to prevent their being called upon to act as jurors without an order of the people. The business goes on. The comitia are postponed by a decree of the senate till such time as the law for the trial with closed doors is carried. The day for passing the law arrived. <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> vetoed it. The consuls, having all along conducted this business in a half-hearted kind of way, referred the matter back to the senate. Hereupon Bedlam! my voice being heard with the rest. Aren't you wise enough to keep quiet, after all? you will say. Forgive me: I can hardly restrain myself. But, nevertheless, was there ever such a farce? The senate had voted that the elections should not be held till the law was passed: that, in case of a tribunician veto, the whole question should be referred to them afresh. The law is introduced in a perfunctory manner: is vetoed, to the great relief of the proposers: the matter is referred to the senate. Upon that the senate voted that it was for the interest of the state that the elections should be held at the earliest possible time! <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a>, who had been acquitted a few days before, after a most elaborate speech from me on his behalf — when all the days up to the 29th of September (On which I write this) had one after the other been rendered impossible for thecomitia by notices of ill omens put in by <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> — paid the people what they expected at his own house, tribe by tribe. But all the same, though his liberality was more generous, it was not so acceptable as that of the two mentioned above, who had got the start of him. I could have wished to see your face when you read this; for I am certain you entertain some hope that these transactions will occupy a great many weeks! But there is to be a meeting of the senate today, that is, the 1st of October — for day is already breaking. There no one will speak his mind except <a href=/people/4853 target=_blank>Antius</a> and <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a>, for <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is ill. Don't be afraid about me: nevertheless, I make no promises. Is there anything else you want to know? Anything? Yes, the trials, I think. <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> and <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> are believed not to have been guilty. Three candidates are thought likely to be prosecuted: <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> <a href=/people/1989 target=_blank>Calvinus</a> by <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> by Q. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, <a href=/people/725 target=_blank>Scaurus</a> by <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a> or by L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. What will you be able to say for them? quoth you. May I die if I know! In those books certainly, of which you speak so highly, I find no suggestion. </p>                        </div>

IV, 18) TO ATTICUS (IN ASIA) ROME, OCTOBER: As it is, to tell you my opinion of affairs, we must put up with it. You ask me how I have behaved. With firmness and dignity. What about <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, you will say, how did he take it? With great consideration, and with the conviction that he must have some regard for my position, until a satisfactory atonement had been made to me. How, then, you will say, was the acquittal secured? It was a case of mere dummies, and incredible incompetence on the part of the accusers — that is to say, of L. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, son of Lucius, who, according to the universal murmur, acted collusively. In the next place, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was extraordinarily urgent; and the jurors were a mean set of fellows. Yet, in spite of everything, there were thirty-two votes for conviction, thirty-eight for acquittal. There are the other prosecutions hanging over his head: he is by no means entirely free yet. You will say, Well, then, how do you bear it? With the best air possible, by heaven! and I really do plume myself on my behaviour. We have lost, my dear <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>, not only all the healthy sap and blood of our old constitution, but even its colour and outward show. There is no Republic to give a moment's pleasure or a feeling of security. And is that, then, you will say, a satisfaction to you? Precisely that. For I recall what a fair course the state had for a short time, while I was at the helm, and what a return has been made me! It does not give me a pang that one man absorbs all power. The men to burst with envy are those who were indignant at my having had some power. There are many things which console me, without my departing an inch from my regular position; and I am returning to the life best suited to my natural disposition — to letters and the studies that I love. My labour in pleading I console by my delight in oratory. I find delight in my town house and my country residences. I do not recall the height from which I have fallen, but the humble position from which I have risen. As long as I have my brother and you with me, let those fellows be hanged, drawn, and quartered for all I care: I can play the philosopher with you. That part of my soul, in which in old times irritability had its home, has grown completely callous. I find no pleasure in anything that is not private and domestic. You will find me in a state of magnificent repose, to which nothing contributes more than the prospect of your return. For there is no one in the wide world whose feelings are so much in sympathy with my own. But now let me tell you the rest. Matters are drifting on to an interregnum; and there is a dictatorship in the air, in fact a good deal of talk about it, which did <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> also some service with timid jurors. All the candidates for the consulship are charged with bribery. You may add to them <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, on whom L. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> had served notice, feeling certain that he was in a hopeless position — <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> having, without success, demanded to have the prosecution. But they will all be acquitted, and henceforth no one will be condemned for any. thing except homicide. This last charge is warmly pressed, and accordingly informers are busy. M. <a href=/people/152 target=_blank>Fulvius</a> <a href=/people/2640 target=_blank>Nobilior</a> has been convicted. Many others have had the wit to abstain from even putting in an appearance. Is there any more news? Yes! After <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>'s acquittal another panel of jurors, in a fit of irritation, an hour later condemned <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, some fellow from the studio of <a href=/people/2665 target=_blank>Sopolis</a>, a freedman and orderly officer of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, under the lex Papia. Consequently he at once remarked, So the Republic will not acquit me under the law of treason as it did you! <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> wants to celebrate a triumph on the 2nd of November. He is openly opposed by the praetors <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> and the tribune Q. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>. For they say that no law for his imperium was ever carried: and this one too was carried, by heaven, in a stupid way. But <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> will have the consul <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> on his side. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, however, declares that he shall never triumph so long as he is alive. I think this affair, like many of the same sort, will come to nothing. <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> thinks of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> without a law, and at his own expense. I received a letter on the 24th of October from my brother and from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, dated from the nearest Coasts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> on the 26th of September. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/530-15IBri class=place long=-1.5 lat=53>Britain</a> done with ... hostages taken no booty ... a tribute, however, imposed; they were on the point of bringing back the army. Q. <a href=/people/4269 target=_blank>Pilius</a> has just set out to join <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. If you have any love for me or your family, or any truth in you, or even if you have any taste left, and any idea of enjoying all your blessings, it is really time for you to be on your way home, and, in fact, almost here. I vow I cannot get on without you. And what wonder that I can't get on without you, when I miss <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> so much? The latter, in fact, as soon as the day comes, both I and my young <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> will demand of you.

About this last, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, I was very nervous, remembering the fur wrappers of your former crossing.

It is exactly as if I were the imperator. The choice was just lately offered him of selecting any of the winter quarters, as he writes me word. Wouldn't you be fond of such a man as that? Of which of your friends would you, if not of him? But look you! did I write you word that I was legatus to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and should be outside the city from the 13th of January onwards? This appeared to me to square with many things. But why say more? I will, I think, reserve the rest till we meet, that you may, after all, have something to look forward to. My very best regards to <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, for whom, indeed, I have not merely kept a place, but have even built one.

This makes it all the more incumbent on you to prevent an additional decree being passed, so that this mutual regret of ours may not last more than a year. As to <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a>, your measures are excellent. As to the guarantee, pray, during your stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, give it yourself. You will find several guarantees on purchase, such as those of the estates of <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, or rather of <a href=/people/3542 target=_blank>Attilius</a>. As to <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, that is exactly what I wished, and especially your having engaged to pay him the 800 sestertia (about 6,400 pounds), which I am determined shall be paid in any case, even if I have to borrow to do so, rather than wait for the last day of getting in my own debts. I now come to that last line of your letter written crossways, in which you give me a word of caution about your sister. The facts of the matter are these. On arriving at my place at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, my brother came to see me, and our first subject of conversation was yourself, and we discussed it at great length.

I never saw anything so gentle and placable as my brother was on that occasion in regard to your sister: so much so, indeed, that if there had been any cause of quarrel on the score of expense, it was not apparent. So much for that day. Next day we started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. A country festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum; I stopped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415137UAqu class=place long=13.6916 lat=41.4983>Aquinum</a>; but we lunched at Arcanum. You know his property there. When we got there Quintus said, in the kindest manner, <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a>, do you ask the ladies in; I will invite the men. Nothing, as I thought, could be more courteous, and that, too, not only in the actual words, but also in his intention and the expression of face. But she, in the hearing of us all, exclaimed, I am only a stranger here! The origin of that was, as I think, the fact that <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> had preceded us to look after the luncheon. Thereupon Quintus said to me, There, that's what I have to put up with every day ! You will say, Well, what does that amount to? A great deal; and, indeed, she had irritated even me: her answer had been given with such unnecessary acrimony, both of word and look. I concealed my annoyance. We all took our places at table except her. However, Quintus sent her dishes from the table, which she declined. In short, I thought I never saw anything better-tempered than my brother, or crosser than your sister: and there were many particulars which I omit that raised my bile more than they did that of Quintus himself. I then went on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415137UAqu class=place long=13.6916 lat=41.4983>Aquinum</a>; Quintus stopped at Arcanum, and joined me early the next day at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415137UAqu class=place long=13.6916 lat=41.4983>Aquinum</a>. He told me that she had refused to sleep with him, and when on the point of leaving, she behaved just as I had seen her. Need I say more? You may tell her herself that in my judgment she showed a marked want of kindness on that day. I have told you this story at greater length, perhaps, than was necessary, to convince you that you, too, have something to do in the way of giving her instruction and advice. There only remains for me to beg you to complete all my commissions before leaving town; to give <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> a push, and make him start; to let me know as soon as you have left town, and to believe that, by heaven, there is nothing I love and find more pleasure in than yourself. I said a most affectionate good-bye to that best of men, A. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138UMin class=place long=13.7684 lat=41.242>Minturnae</a>, to whom I wish you would remark, in the course of conversation, that I have mentioned him in my letter. </p>                        </div>

V, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) POMPEII, 10 MAY: On the 10th of May, the date of this letter, I am about to start from my Pompeian villa, intending to stay to-night with <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a> in his villa near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412143UTre class=place long=14.2617 lat=41.2271>Trebula</a>. After that I mean to make regular days' journeys without any farther delay. While in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa I was much gratified by a visit from our friend <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. When he asked me whether he could do anything for me, I answered in general terms about everything else; but I begged him in particular to prevent, as far as in him lay, any extension of my provincial government. In this please confirm him, and tell him that I was much gratified by his visit, and by his promise to do this for me, and anything else I wanted besides. I have strongly urged the same on our friend <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a>, who, I see, will be a tribune for next year. I had a kind of miniature <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa: there was such a crowd of people in the neighbourhood. In the midst of all this our friend <a href=/people/8250 target=_blank>Rufio</a>, seeing that he was being watched by <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, tricked that gentleman by a ruse de guerre. For he never came near me. What! you will say, when <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> came, in spite of being in weak health and living at such a distance and being the great <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, and such a crowd of people besides — do you mean to say that he didn't come? So you didn't see the fellow at all? How could I help seeing him, when my road lay through the mart of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>? There as he was, I presume, doing some business, I said How d'ye do? to him; and on a later occasion I bade him good-bye when he came out of his own villa and asked me whether he could do anything for me. A man like that is one to reckon ungrateful? Doesn't he rather deserve Commendation for not exerting himself to get a hearing? But to return to my subject. Do not imagine that anything can console me for this gigantic bore, except the hope that it will not last longer than a year. Many will not believe me in this, because they judge from the habit of others. You, who know the truth, pray use every exertion; I mean, when the time comes for the question to be mooted. As soon as you return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, I beg you to write about public affairs and tell me anything you may detect. For satisfactory intelligence has not reached as far as this as to how <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> took the senatorial resolution being written out; and there was also a rumour about the Transpadani, that they had been bidden to elect quattuorviri. If that is the case I fear some great disturbances. But I shall learn something from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. </p>                        </div>

What you think about all this, and when the crisis will come, please let me know.

V, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BENEVENTUM, 12 MAY: I ARRIVED at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411148PBen class=place long=14.78 lat=41.13>Beneventum</a> on the 11th of May. There I received the letter which in your previous letter (answered by me the same day from <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412143UTre class=demonym long=14.2617 lat=41.2271>Trebulanum</a>) you had mentioned having sent. And, indeed, I have received two letters from you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411148PBen class=place long=14.78 lat=41.13>Beneventum</a>, one delivered to me by Funisulanus early in the morning, and a second handed to me by my secretary <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. I am much obliged by the pains you have taken about my first and most important commission: but your leaving town rather damps my hopes. As to the man you mention, I am coming round in that direction, not that -, but we are forced to be content with him for want of a better. About the other one, of whom you say that he appeared to you to be not unsuitable — I am afraid my daughter could not be persuaded, and you admit that there is not a pin to choose between them. For my part, I am not unreasonable; but you will be away, and will not, therefore, have a hand in the business in my absence. For if either of. us were on the spot, some fairly satisfactory arrangement might be made with <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, with <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> to back him. As at present situated, even though it should be a thing I like, I don't see how I can do anything. Now I come to the letter delivered to me by <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. You have been very energetic about <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>. Accordingly, if the decree has passed the senate, please write me word: but if not, do your best to get the business through; for a grant must be made to me, as also to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>. I have no doubt of the decree of the senate being passed without difficulty, especially considering that it is a gain to the people. As to <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, excellent! As to Mason and <a href=/people/2322 target=_blank>Ligur</a>, that will do when they have come. As to the request of <a href=/people/4479 target=_blank>Chaerippus</a>: since in this case also you have given me no tip, . . . Bother your province! Must I look after him too? Yes; but only so far as to prevent there being any obstructive debate! or count! in the senate. For as to the rest -, however, thank you for speaking to <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>. As to what you say about <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>, I quite agree. For the upshot is that, if he is going to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> before the 1st of June, M. <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> and L. <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> need not have been so much hurried. As to what you have heard from <a href=/people/1571 target=_blank>Sicinius</a>, I quite assent, provided only that this restriction does not apply to anyone who has done me a service. But I will turn the matter over, for I quite approve of it in principle. I will let you know what I have settled as to the plan of my journey, and also what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> means to do about the five prefects, when I have learnt it from himself. As to <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, you have acted quite rightly in having assured him of the 800 sestertia; and since you have <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> with you, pray see the business through; examine the account, and, as you love me, settle it before leaving town. You will have relieved me of a great anxiety. Now I have answered all your letter: but stay! I almost omitted your being short of paper. The loss is mine, if for lack of it your letter to me is curtailed. Why, you cost me a couple of hundred sesterces: though how stingy I am in this particular the cramped nature of this page shows you: while in return I expect from you a gazette of events, rumours, or even anything you know for certain about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Be sure you give a letter to <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>, as well as to others, on every imaginable topic. </p>                        </div>

In a letter received from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=person long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I am informed that my friend <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a> writes to complain of my having ill-treated him in allowing <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> to have a share in the purchase of his property. I decided on that measure in accordance with the opinion of C. Duronius, whom I had had reason to believe exceedingly friendly to <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, and whom I knew to be the sort of man you judge him to be. Now his object and mine too was this: first, that the property should remain under our control — lest some outsider, making the purchase at a high price, should deprive him of the slaves, a great number of which he had with him; secondly, that the settlement he had made upon <a href=/people/5010 target=_blank>Fausta</a> should be respected. There was the farther motive, that we should ourselves have less difficulty than anyone else in saving anything that could be saved. Now I would have you look thoroughly into the whole affair: for I am frequently having letters on it written in exaggerated terms. If he complains, if he writes about it to his friends, and if <a href=/people/5010 target=_blank>Fausta</a> takes the same line, as I told <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> by word of mouth, and as he undertook to do, I would not have him take part in the purchase against the will of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>. It would not be in the least worth our while. But if there is nothing in all this, you will decide the matter. Speak with Duronius. I have written also to <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> and <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>, and the more so because I did not feel confident of your being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390208SAkt class=place long=20.7683 lat=38.9509>Actium</a> I preferred to journey by land, considering the unpleasant voyage we had had, and I did not like the idea of rounding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386205SApo class=place long=20.5486 lat=38.5688>Leucatas</a>. To arrive, again, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a> in small boats, without all this paraphernalia, seemed to me somewhat undignified. Yes, your frequent exhortations have fallen on willing ears! I daily turn them over in my own mind and impress them on my staff: in fine, I will make certain of passing through this extraordinary function without the least illegality or extortion. I only hope the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> will keep quiet and fortune favour us! I will do my part. Pray take care to let me know what you are doing, where you mean to be from time to time, in what state you left things at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and, above all, about the 820 sestertia. Put all that into one letter, carefully directed so as to be sure of reaching me in any case. But that my year of office should remain unchanged and without any addition being decreed, for this remember to take proper measures yourself and through all my friends, especially through <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>: for, though absent at present, when the question is not before the house, you will, as you said in one of your answers, be in town at the proper time. While pressing this upon you, I feel half-inclined to beg you also to fight against there being an inter-calation. But I don't venture to put all the burdens on your back. As for the year, stick to that at any rate. My son <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, the best-behaved and dearest of boys, sends you his regards. I always liked <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, for my part, as you know; but I get to value him more every day, and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, principally because he loves you, and never lets an opportunity slip of talking about you. </p>                        </div>

V, 10) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ATHENS, 27 JUNE: I ARRIVED at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> on the 24th of June, and have now waited there three days for <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> and have heard nothing as yet of his arrival. I am, believe me, wholly with you: and though I should have done so without them, yet I am thinking of you all the more vividly from being reminded by the traces of you in this place. In short, I assure you we talk of nothing else but you. But you, perhaps, would prefer to be told something about myself. Here you are then: up to now neither I nor any of my staff have been any expense to any town or individual. We receive nothing under the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> law, nothing from any public host: my whole staff are impressed with the belief that they must have a regard for reputation. So far, well. This has been noticed with praise on the part of the Greeks and is being much talked of. For the rest, I am taking great pains, as I have perceived that you wished. But on this subject let us reserve our applause till the last act has been reached. Other circumstances are such that I frequently blame my folly for not having found some means of getting out of this business. How entirely unsuited to my character and habits! How true the proverb is, Let the shoemaker stick to his last ! You will say, What, already? Why, you are not actually in the business ! I know that very well, and I expect greater trouble remains: even as far as it has gone, though I bear it with cheerful brow, I think, and expression, in my inmost heart I am enduring agonies: so many instances are occurring every day of ill-temper or insolence, of foolish and senseless behaviour of every kind, both by speech and by refusal to speak. I don't give you details of these things, not because I wish to conceal them from you, but because they are difficult to explain. So you shall admire my self-restraint when I return safe and sound: I am bestowing such pains on the practice of this virtue. Well, enough of this. Though I had nothing in my mind that I intended to write about, because I haven't even the smallest idea as to what you are doing, and in what part of the world you are: nor, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, have I ever been so completely in the dark about my own affairs, as to what has been done about the debt to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> or <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s liabilities; and no one has come, I don't say from my house, but even from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, to enlighten me as to what is going on in politics. Wherefore, if there is anything that you know on the subjects which you may suppose that I should wish to know, I shall be very much obliged if you take the trouble to have it transmitted to me. What else is there to say? Why, nothing except this: <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> has pleased me immensely, at any rate as far as the city itself and all that adorns it are concerned, and the affection of the inhabitants towards you, and what I may call a prepossession in favour of myself: but as to its philosophy — that is very topsy-turvey, if <a href=/people/3536 target=_blank>Aristus</a> is supposed to represent it, in whose house I am staying. For your and my friend <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> I preferred giving up to Quintus, and yet, owing to his proximity, we spend whole days together. Pray, as soon as you possibly can, write me word of your plans, and let me know what you are doing, where you are from time to time, especially when you intend being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

Well then, hereafter, rather than consent not to send you a letter, if that can be done safely, I will send one that may never reach you. Whatever step can be taken to provide against the prolongation of my government, in the name of fortune, take, so long as you are in town. I can't describe to you the warmth of my longing for the city, or the difficulty I feel in putting up with the boredom of this business. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>'s action in the case of the man of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/45891UCom class=place long=9.0855 lat=45.812>Comum</a> was disgraceful. Even if he were not a magistrate, he was yet an inhabitant of Gallia Transpadana. So he seems to me to have given no less cause of anger to our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> than to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. But this is his own look-out. I think, from what you tell me that <a href=/people/79 target=_blank>Varro</a> says, that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> certainly means to go to Spain. I entirely disapprove of it, and indeed I easily convinced <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> that the best course was for him not to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to go anywhere. So the Greek will put pressure on him; and his influence is very powerful with him. I send this letter on the 6th of July, when on the point of quitting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, where I have been exactly ten days. <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> has arrived along with Cn. <a href=/people/2797 target=_blank>Volusius</a>; my quaestor is here; the only one missing is your friend <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. I have some open vessels of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, some biremes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mitylene</a>, and a certain amount of despatch boats. I don't hear a word about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. For the rest, heaven preserve us! As yet our journey through Greece has roused great admiration, nor, by heaven, have I as yet a fault to find with any of my staff. They appear to me to understand my point of view and the conditions on which they accompany me. They entirely devote themselves to my reputation. For the future, if the proverb like mistress like <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>  holds good, they will certainly stick to this line of conduct. For they will not see me doing anything to give them an excuse for malpractices. But if that does not prove sufficient, I shall have to take some stronger measure. For at present I am all smiles and indulgence, and, as I hope, am making considerable progress. But I have only studied the part of tolerator — as our friends the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> call it — for a single year. Therefore fight your best, lest if any addition is made to my time, I should turn out a scoundrel. Now to return to your commands: praefecti are excused jury service: offer the position to whom you choose. I will not be so high and mighty as I was in the case of <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a>. I am as fond of <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> as you are, of which I feel sure that he is fully aware. With Patron and the rest of the (<a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a>) dunces I have established your reputation well, and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, it is no more than you deserve. For that person told me three times over that you had written to him to say that I had taken measures about his affair in accordance with a letter from <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, and this pleased him very much. But Patron having urged me to request your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> to cancel their minute, made in the archonship of <a href=/people/3938 target=_blank>Polycharmus</a>, it seemed best to <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a>, and afterwards to Patron himself, that I should write to <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>, who had started for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=place long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mitylene</a> the day before my arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, to induce him to write to his agents that it might be done with his free consent. For <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> felt sure that it would be impossible to get this concession from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagites</a> if <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> were unwilling. Now <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a> had laid aside his design of building, but he was angry with Patron. So I wrote him a carefully expressed letter, of which I enclose you a copy. Please comfort <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> with a message from me. For I will tell you, though don't tell her. I received a packet which contained <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>'s letter. I abstracted, opened, and read it. It was in very sympathetic terms. The letters you got from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> without one from me you must regard as having been sent when I was unwell; for don't take seriously the excuse I mentioned of expense. Take care to let me know everything, but, above all, take care of your health. </p>                        </div>

Thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376247IGya class=place long=24.732 lat=37.602>Gyaros</a> with a violent wind, though it wasn't against us. Hence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374249PSyr class=place long=24.941 lat=37.447>Syros</a>, and from that to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>; we in both cases accomplished the passage quicker than we could have wished.

But I am very anxious to get your letter about what is said as to that verdict, and, indeed, about the political situation generally — a letter written somewhat more from the politician's point of view, for you are now, with the aid of Thallumetus, studying my books — a letter from which I may learn not what is actually happening (for that very superior person, your client Helonius, can do that for me), but what is going to happen. By the time you read this our consuls will have been elected.

I think the latter of very great importance from my own ideas as well as from what you say about it. So please have it done. Again, if <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> makes any application, do exactly what you would have done in your own case.

The fact is, however, that the tithe-collectors, as though I had come with imperium, the Greeks, as though I were governor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, presented themselves to me with eagerness. This will, I am sure, convince you that the professions I have been making these many years past are now being put to the test. But I shall, I hope, stick to the principles which I learnt from you, and give full satisfaction to everyone, and with the less difficulty that the contracts in my province have been settled. I did not neglect your little affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, and although <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a> before my arrival had been most courteous in his promises to all your agents, yet I introduced <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> and <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> to him, and recommended <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/389277UApo class=person long=27.6846 lat=38.8989>Apollonis</a>. In a word, he undertook to do everything. I besides submitted to <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> an account of the note of exchange, which I had negotiated with you.

Next fulfil all my commissions, and especially in regard to that domestic matter get rid of the difficulty with which you are acquainted. Next to that do so in the matter of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: it was on your advice that I set my heart on him, and I do not repent. And, as you well understand how it is my nature to know and care for what is going on in public affairs — going on, do I say? nay, rather what is going to happen — write me everything at full length, and that with the utmost precision, and especially whether there is any breakdown in the trials that have either taken place or are about to do so.

V, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TRALLES, 28 JULY: Until I have settled down somewhere you must not expect a long letter from me, nor always written by my own hand. As soon, however, as I have a moment to spare, you shall have both. I am now journeying along a road which is both hot and dusty. I wrote yesterday from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>: this I am despatching from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379278UTra class=place long=27.8354 lat=37.8598>Tralles</a>. I expect to be in my province on the 1st of August. From that date, if you love me, agitate for my era to begin. Meanwhile, however, the following items of news of a welcome nature have reached me: first, that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> are quiet; secondly, that the contracts of the publicani have been concluded; lastly, that a mutiny among the soldiers has been suppressed by <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and their pay discharged up to the 13th of July. Asia has given me an extraordinarily good reception. My visit there cost no one a farthing. I trust that my staff are respecting my reputation. I am very nervous about it, however, yet hope for the best. All my staff have now joined except your friend <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. My idea is to go straight to the army, to devote the rest of the summer months to military affairs, the winter ones to judicial business. Pray, as you know that I have no less curiosity in politics than yourself, write me word of everything occurring or about to occur. You can do me no greater favour, except, indeed, that it will be the greatest favour of all if you fulfil my commissions, especially that at my own hearth, than which you must know I have nothing more at heart. This letter reeks of hurry and dust. Future ones shall go into greater details. </p>                        </div>

V, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) LAODICEA, 3 AUGUST: I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> on the 31st of July. From this day, therefore, count the beginning of my year. Nothing could be more warmly, more affectionately welcomed, than my arrival. But you can scarcely believe how bored I am with the business. Has not that intellectual range, which you know so well, wide enough field? and is my splendid industry likely to rust unemployed? Why, just look at this! That I should be sitting in court at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, while A. <a href=/people/3072 target=_blank>Plotius</a> is doing so at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>! And that, while our friend has that great army, I should have nominal command of two wretched legions! But the fact is, that it is not such things as these that I miss: it is the broad daylight of life, the forum, the city, my town house, you that I miss. But I will endure it as best I may, provided that it does not last more than a year. If there is any extension, I am lost! But this may easily be resisted, if only you are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. You ask me what I am doing. Why, upon my life, I am living at a vast expense. I am wonderfully pleased with this course. My disinterested conduct, founded on your injunctions, is so admirable, that I am afraid that the money I took up from you will have to be paid by a fresh loan. I avoid reopening any wounds inflicted by <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, but they are patent and cannot be concealed. I am starting today, the 3rd of August, on which I despatch this letter, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> to the camp in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375324RLyk class=place long=32.4 lat=37.5>Lycaonia</a>: thence I think of going to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, that by means of a pitched battle with <a href=/people/3428 target=_blank>Moeragenes</a> I may, if possible, settle the question of your slave. The saddle's on the <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a>: no load for us: But I shall put up with it, only, as you love me, let me be only kept a year. Mind you are in town at the right moment, to keep every senator up to the mark. I am feeling wonderfully anxious, because I have had no news of what is going on among you for a long time. Wherefore, as I have said before in my letters, see that I am kept acquainted with politics as well as everything else. I know this letter will be somewhat long in reaching you, but I am entrusting it to a familiar and intimate friend, C. <a href=/people/1064 target=_blank>Andronicus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=person long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>. You, however, will have frequent opportunities of giving letters to the letter-carriers of the publicani by the favour of the head contractors for the pasture-tax and harbour dues of our districts. </p>                        </div>

V, 16) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CILICIA, AUGUST: Though the letter-carriers of the publicani are starting while I am actually travelling and on the road, and though I am still engaged on my progress, yet I thought I must snatch a moment to prevent your thinking me forgetful of your charge. So I have sat down actually on the road to write you in brief what follows, which really calls for a somewhat lengthy essay. Let me tell you, then, that with the highest possible reputation I entered, on the 31st of July, into a province in a state of desolation and lasting ruin; that I stayed three days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, three at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>, the same at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385306USyn class=place long=30.55 lat=38.533>Synnada</a>. It was the same tale everywhere: they could not pay the poll-tax: everybody's securities were sold: groans, lamentations, from the towns: acts of savagery worthy of some wild beast, rather than of a man. In short, they are absolutely weary of their life. However, the wretched towns are somewhat relieved by my costing them nothing, nor my legates, nor quaestor, nor anyone. Let me tell you that I not only refuse to accept hay, which is customarily furnished under the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> law, but that no one of us accepts even firewood, or anything else, except four beds and a roof to cover us; in many districts we do not accept even a roof, but remain, as a rule, under canvas. Accordingly, we are greeted by extraordinary throngs from farms, villages, houses, every sort of place. By <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, on my mere arrival, the justice, purity, and merciful heart of your <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> seems to give them new life: so far has he surpassed everyone's hopes. <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, as soon as he heard of my arrival, hurried to the most distant part of the province, right up to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>: there he is holding sessions. About the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> not a word: but, nevertheless, some who come from those parts announce that some cavalry of ours have been cut to pieces. <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> even now is not so much as thinking of approaching his province. People say that he is acting thus because he wishes to leave it somewhat later. We are making all haste to the camp, which is two days' journey away. </p>                        </div>

V, 17) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) LYCAONIA, AUGUST: I have received a packet of letters from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> without one from you, for which, granting you to be well and in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I imagine the fault to be <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>'s, not yours. I dictate this letter sitting in my carriage, on my way to the camp, from which I am two days' journey distant. In a few days' time I am going to have men on whom I can rely to take letters. Accordingly, I reserve myself for that. However, I will just say, though I should prefer your hearing this from others — I am so conducting myself in the province that no farthing is spent on anyone. This is owing also to the careful conduct of legates, tribunes, and prefects. For one and all entertain a surprising desire to vie with each other in maintaining my reputation. My friend Lepta is wonderful in that respect. But at present I am in a hurry: I will write everything' in full to you in a few days. The younger <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> who has received the title of king from the senate, has taken my son and nephew with him to his own dominions. So long as I am in the summer camp, I thought that the safest place for the boys. <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> has written me an account of his conversation with you about my domestic anxiety, which is a very serious one, and of what your opinion is. Pray throw yourself into that matter, and write me word what can be done and what you think. He also told me that <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> had said something or other about the extension of my provincial government. He promised me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> that he would most energetically plead for my being kept here only a year. If you have any affection for me, strengthen this position. I cannot tell you how against the grain my absence from you is. At the same time, too, I hope that my present reputation for justice and purity will be all the more conspicuous if I quit the province early. This is what happened to <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, who governed Asia only nine months. Our friend <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, as soon as he saw that I was on the point of arriving, left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> and went as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>. There he is holding an assize, though I am actually in the province. However, I do not make any fuss about this slight upon myself; for I have enough to do in healing the wounds which have been inflicted upon the province. This I am taking care to do with as little reflection upon him as possible: but I should like you to tell our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> that it was not very polite of him to remove to the farthest possible distance on my arrival. </p>                        </div>

I have not yet heard of the arrival of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> is in the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> with the whole army: I am in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, close to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>, with my army near <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377342UKyb class=place long=34.2269 lat=37.6621>Cybistra</a>: the enemy is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367370UKyr class=place long=36.959 lat=36.7442>Cyrrhestica</a>, which is the part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> next to my province. On these subjects I have sent a despatch to the senate. This despatch please look at, if you are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and consider whether you think it ought to be delivered; and so with many other things, or rather with all, chief of which is that there be no slip betwixt the cup and the lip — as the saying is — to add additional burden upon me, or an extension of my time. For, considering the weakness of my army, and the short supply of allies, especially faithful ones, my most trustworthy support is winter. If that has once come, and they have not first crossed into my province, the only thing I fear is that the senate will not allow <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, owing to the alarming state of affairs in the city. But if it sends some one else next spring, I do not trouble myself, always providing that my term of office is not prolonged. So much for you if you are at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But if you are out of town, or even if you are not, the state of affairs here is this: we are in good spirits; and since, as it seems, our plans are well laid, we cherish the hope that we are strong enough also to carry them out. We have pitched our camp in a safe spot, well supplied in the matter of corn, almost commanding a view of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, convenient for shifting quarters, and with an army which, although small, is yet, I hope, entirely loyal to me; and we are about to double its numbers by the arrival of <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> in full force. I have found the allies much more loyal than anyone has ever done: and they can scarcely believe their eyes when they see the mildness of my administration and the purity of my conduct. A levy of Roman citizens is being held; corn is being carted from the country to places of safety. If, then, occasion arises, we shall defend ourselves by force; if not, by the strength of our position. Wherefore do not be alarmed. For I have you before my eyes, and I perceive, as though you were present, your affectionate solicitude for me. Now I beg you, if it is in any way possible, supposing my affair to remain undecided up to the 1st of January, to be in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in January. I am quite certain of receiving no unfair treatment if you are on the spot. The consuls are my friends, the tribune <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a> is wholly devoted to me. Still there is need of your persistence, good sense, and popularity. It is a momentous crisis. But it is not decent for me to press you at greater length. Our two Ciceros are staying with <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, but, if it shall be necessary, they will be transferred to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>. Do you, if in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with your accustomed punctuality, and anyhow, even if you are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, send one of your servants with letters, that both you may know what I am doing, and I what you are doing or about to do. I am doing your friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s business for him better than he would have done it himself. But I now produce my ward, and do not attempt to defend him. For they are a dilatory lot, and there is nothing to be got out of them. However, I will satisfy you, which is more difficult than satisfying <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> himself. But in truth, I will satisfy you both. </p>                        </div>

Who the mischief are your <a href=/people/10087 target=_blank>Pindenissetae</a>? who are they? you will say: I never heard their name. Well, what am I to do? Could I turn <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> into an <a about=https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit class=place long=21.5 lat=38.6>Aetolia</a> or a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=place long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonia</a>? Let me tell you this, that with an army such as mine, and in a place like this, such a big business was impossible. You shall have it all en abrege; as you agreed in your last letter to take it. You know about my arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, for you have congratulated me on my enthusiastic reception on that day, which gave me as much pleasure as anything ever did in my life. Thence, after a surprising reception in such towns as lay on my road, I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> on the 31st of July. I remained there two days in the midst of great enthusiasm, and by my conciliatory language removed the rankling injuries of the last four years. I did the same afterwards during my five days stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a> and three days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385306USyn class=place long=30.55 lat=38.533>Synnada</a>, five at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384314UPhi class=place long=31.416 lat=38.3555>Philomelium</a>, ten at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Iconium</a>. Nothing could be more impartial, mild, or dignified, than my administration of justice there. Thence I came to the camp on the 24th of August; on the 28th I inspected the army at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379325PIko class=place long=32.4921 lat=37.8728>Iconium</a>. From this camp, on receipt of serious news as to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>, I started for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> by way of that part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> which borders on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, with the design of impressing upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=person long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenian</a> <a href=/people/2290 target=_blank>Artavasdes</a> and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> themselves that they were precluded from entering <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>. After having been encamped for five days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377342UKyb class=place long=34.2269 lat=37.6621>Cybistra</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, I got intelligence that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> were at a long distance from that entrance into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>, and were rather threatening <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>. I therefore marched rapidly into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> by the Gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a>. I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> on the 5th of October. Thence I pressed on to Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371366LAma class=place long=36.617 lat=37.1408>Amanus</a>, which divides <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> by the line of its watershed — a mountain full of immemorial enemies. Here, on the 13th of October, we cut a large number of the enemy to pieces. We took some very strongly fortified posts by a night attack of <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>'s, and by one led by myself in the morning, and burnt them. I was greeted as imperator by the soldiers. For a few days we were encamped on the very spot which <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> had occupied against <a href=/people/29 target=_blank>Darius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss class=place long=36.216 lat=36.752>Issus</a>, a commander not a little superior to either you or me! Having stayed there five days, and having ravaged and devastated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371366LAma class=place long=36.617 lat=37.1408>Amanus</a>, we evacuated that place. For you know that there are things called panics, called also war's idle rumours. From the report of our arrival encouragement was at once given to <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, then confined to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, and alarm inspired in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. Accordingly, as they were retiring from that town, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> pursued them and gained a hand-some victory. In the course of this retreat the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> leader, Osaces, a man in high authority, received a wound of which a few days afterwards he died. My name became very popular in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>. Meanwhile <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> arrived. I suppose he wanted to be on an equality with me in the matter of this vain acclamation of imperator. In this same Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371366LAma class=place long=36.617 lat=37.1408>Amanus</a> he begins looking for a bay-leaf in a wedding cake. But he lost the whole of his first cohort and the centurion of the first line, a man of high rank in his own class, <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a> Dento, and the other centurions of the same cohort, as well as a military tribune, Sext. <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a>, son of T. <a href=/people/1745 target=_blank>Gavius</a> <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a>, a man of wealth, and high position. It was really a very galling blow both in itself and in the time of its reception. I was at Pindenissus, the most strongly fortified town of Eleutherocilicia, never peaceful within living memory. The people were fierce and brave, and furnished with everything necessary for standing a siege. We surrounded it with stockade and ditch, with a huge earthwork, pent-houses, an exceedingly lofty tower, a great supply of artillery, a large body of archers. After great labour and preparation I finished the business without loss to my army, though with a large number of wounded. I am spending a merry <a href=/people/12227 target=_blank>Saturnalia</a>, and so are my soldiers, to whom I have given up all spoil except captives: the captives were sold on the third day of the <a href=/people/12227 target=_blank>Saturnalia</a> (I 9th December), the day on which I write this. The sum realized at the tribunal is 12,000 sestertia (about 96,000 pounds). I intend to hand over the army to my brother Quintus to lead hence into winter quarters in the disturbed districts. I am myself going back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>. So much for this. But to return to points omitted. As to what you urge upon me most warmly, and which in fact is more important than anything else, namely, your anxiety that I should satisfy my carping <a about=https://topostext.org/place/443083RLig class=demonym long=8.3 lat=44.3>Ligurian</a> critic, may I die if anything could be more fastidious than my conduct. And I do not now speak of it as self-restraint, which is a virtue considered capable of resisting pleasure: while the fact is that I never in all my life felt such pleasure as I do at my own integrity. And it is not so much the reputation I get by it — though that is of the highest — as the thing itself that delights me. In short, it was worth the trouble: I never appreciated myself or knew fully of what I was capable in this direction. I have good reason for being puffed up. Nothing could be more splendid. Meanwhile, here is a score for me! <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a> is alive and a king all owing to me. By my prudence and prestige, and by refusing to receive even the visits, to say nothing of the bribes, of the conspirators against his life, I have, merely en Passant, saved a king and a kingdom. In the meantime from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a> not the value of a hair! I have recovered <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> from his dejection, whom I love no less than you do, I had almost said, than I do you. And I almost hope that throughout my year of office not a farthing's expense will be caused to my province. There is the whole story for you. I am now composing an official despatch to send to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. It will be somewhat fuller of matter than if I had sent it from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371366LAma class=place long=36.617 lat=37.1408>Amanus</a>. But to think that you won't be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>! And yet everything depends on the 1st of March. For I am afraid, if; on the question of the province coming up, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> shall refuse compliance, I may be kept here. If you were there when this was going on, I should not have been at all afraid. I return to the city news, which, after a long interval of ignorance, I have at length learnt from your most delightful letter received on the 16th of December. This was conveyed by your freedman <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> after a very long and far from safe journey. For the letter you say that you delivered to the slaves of <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a> I have not received. I am delighted about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and the decrees of the senate, and at what you expect to happen. If he gives way to these we are safe. That <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> got scorched in <a href=/people/6828 target=_blank>Plaetorius</a>'s fire does not grieve me much. I long to know why <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> has been so hot about Q. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, and what has been done about it. For myself, as soon as I arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> I am bidden to invest Quintus, your sister's son, with the toga virilis, and I will keep a more than usually careful eye upon him. <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, who has been of great assistance to me, is, according to a letter received from him, about to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> with our two boys. I am expecting another letter from you from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, that I may get a notion not only of your business life, but of your holiday also. <a href=/people/401 target=_blank>Nicanor</a> serves me well and receives liberal treatment at my hands. I think I shall send him to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with my official despatch, to secure its being conveyed with more than common promptitude, and that he may also bring me trustworthy intelligence about you and from you. That your <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a> so often puts in a greeting to me is gratifying. But why does he not treat me to a letter of his own, as my <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a> does you. I am looking out for a horn for Phaemius. But enough of this. Take care of your health, and let me know when you think of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Good-bye! good-bye! I have recommended your interests and your agents in very warm terms to <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a>, both in a personal interview at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> and now by letter, and I gathered that he was himself very anxious to serve you. Pray, as I have often mentioned before, see about the house of <a href=/people/1594 target=_blank>Pammenes</a>, and take care that the boy is not deprived, by any means, of what he now possesses through our joint support. I not only think that this concerns the honour of us both, but it will also gratify me personally very much. </p>                        </div>

V, 21) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) LAODICEA, 13 FEBRUARY: I am very glad to hear of your safe arrival in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, and that, as you say, you had a pleasant voyage. I am a little annoyed at your not being in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at a crisis of great importance to me, but I console myself with the one reflexion, that you are having a pleasant winter there and are enjoying your rest. Gaius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, brother of your friend Quintus <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, had sent a despatch — of which you ask me the meaning — written in a more modest strain than the later one in which he says that he had made an end of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war. It is true that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> had retired from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a> before the arrival of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, but it was from no success of our arms. At this present moment they are, as a matter of fact, wintering in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367370UKyr class=place long=36.959 lat=36.7442>Cyrrhestica</a>, and a most serious war is impending. For the son of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> king <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a> is within the Roman province, and <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, to whose son the daughter of Ariovasdes is betrothed — so he ought to know — has no doubt of the king himself intending to cross the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a> in full force at the beginning of summer. Besides, on the day on which <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s victorious despatch was read in the senate (dated the 7th of October) one was read from me also, announcing an alarm of war. My friend <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> says that my despatch made a great impression, that his was not credited. That of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> had not yet been received, which I am quite sure will be thoroughly alarmist. The result of this, I fear, will be that, as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is not allowed to be sent anywhere for fear of a revolution, and no attention is paid by the senate to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s demands, while this knot remains to be untied, the senate will not think that I ought to quit my province till a successor has arrived, and that in such troublous times legates should not be left in charge of two such important provinces. In view of this I tremble lest my tenure should be prolonged, without even a tribune being able to stop it, and all the more so that you are not in town to interpose, as you might have done in many cases by your advice, your personal influence and activity. But you will say I am piling up anxiety for myself with my own hands. I can't help it: I wish that it may be so. But everything causes me alarm. Though your letter that you wrote at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> in your sickness had a charming finale. As I see and hope, there will be nothing to delay your departure from your province. I should have preferred that you had confined yourself to as I see: there was no need to add and hope. Again, I have received a letter written just after the triumph of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, which came with great celerity by the hands of the postmen of the publicani. In this you reiterate the same bitter-sweet, first saying that there will be no delay of my return, and then adding, If anything goes wrong you will come to me. Your doubts torture me: at the same time you may see which of your letters I have received. For the one which you say yourself that you delivered to the centurion <a href=/people/12141 target=_blank>Hermon</a>'s servant I have not received. You have often mentioned having given a letter to <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a>'s servants. That one <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a> did deliver to me at last, on my arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, the 11th of February, dated the 21st of September. I will, at once by what I say to him, and by deeds hereafter, give <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a> reason to be satisfied with your recommendation. That letter had much news that was stale, one thing that was new — about the panthers from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372295UCib class=place long=29.4918 lat=37.1602>Cibyra</a>. I am much obliged to you for telling M. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> that you didn't think I would do it. But pray henceforth, in any case of doubt, give a direct negative. The fact is that, supported by a spontaneous resolution of my own, and also, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, from the inspiration of your influence, I have surpassed everybody (and you will find this to be the case) in preserving clean hands, no less than in justice, courtesy, and mildness. Don't. imagine that anything has ever surprised people more than the fact that not a farthing of expense has been caused to the province during my governorship, either for my public establishment or for any individual on my staff, except L <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>. He,' who in other respects is clean-handed enough, did take something on the road in virtue of the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> law not as others do at every hamlet, but once only and for the day's journey. He is the only one who has done so: and he forces me to make an exception when I say that not a farthing of expense has been caused. No one except him has taken anything. This blot I owe to our friend Q. <a href=/people/1599 target=_blank>Titinius</a>. At the end of the summer campaign I put my brother Quintus in charge of the winter quarters and of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>. I have sent your friend <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a>'s son-in-law Quintus <a href=/people/2797 target=_blank>Volusius</a> — not only a safe man, but also wonderfully disinterested — to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, with orders to stay some few days there, to prevent the few Roman citizens who are in business there from saying that they have no means of legal redress: for it is illegal for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a> to be cited in courts out of the island. I myself started for Asia from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> on the 5th of January, accompanied by an admiration, which, by heaven, it is difficult to describe, from the cities in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, and specially from the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a>. As soon, however, as I had crossed the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> I found our dioceses in Asia on the tiptoe of expectation: for in the six months of my administration Asia had not received a single letter of injunction from me, nor had had a single official to entertain. Now before my time that particular period had been each year a source of gain, by. the richer states paying large sums of money to be exempted from furnishing the soldiers with winter quarters. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a> used to pay 200 <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> talents, from which island — I am not speaking in hyperbole, but the simple truth — not a single farthing is exacted under my administration. For these benefits, which they regard with speechless astonishment, I allow no honours, except verbal ones, to be decreed to me: statues, temples, marble chariots I forbid; nor am I a nuisance to the states in any other respect — though I may be to you by thus blowing my own trumpet. But, an you love me, put up with it! It was you who wished me to act thus. My progress through Asia was of such a nature that even the famine, which prevailed in my part of Asia at the time — the most distressing thing there is — has been in a manner a welcome event. Wherever I went, without using force, legal compulsion, or strong language, I induced both the Greeks and Roman citizens, who had cornered the wheat, to promise large quantities to the communities. On the 13th of February — the day I am despatching this letter — I have arranged to hold a court at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> for the district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372295UCib class=place long=29.4918 lat=37.1602>Cibyra</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>: from the 15th of March at the same place for the districts of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385306USyn class=place long=30.55 lat=38.533>Synnada</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a> (when I will look out for a horn for Phemius), <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375324RLyk class=place long=32.4 lat=37.5>Lycaonia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372324UIsa class=place long=32.3526 lat=37.1895>Isauria</a>. After the 15th of May I start for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, with the view of spending June there — I hope without trouble from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a>. July, if all goes as I wish, will be needed for my return journey through the province. I entered the province at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> in the consulship of <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a> and <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> on the 31st of July. I am due to leave it on the 30th of July. I shall first of all press my brother Quintus to allow himself to be left in charge, which will be very much against the wishes of us both. But that is the only respectable arrangement possible, especially as I cannot even now keep the excellent <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>: for <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a> hurries him back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and perhaps <a href=/people/3671 target=_blank>Postumia</a> also. Now you know my plans. Next, let me enlighten you about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. Your friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has among his intimates certain creditors of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, M. <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> and P. <a href=/people/6650 target=_blank>Matinius</a>, whom he has recommended to me with more than common earnestness. I have not made the acquaintance of <a href=/people/6650 target=_blank>Matinius</a>: <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> came to the camp to see me. I promised for the sake of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> to see that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> paid him the money. He thanked me, and asked for a prefecture. I said that I never granted one to a man engaged in business, a rule of which I have already informed you. When Cn. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> asked me he accepted the propriety of this rule — I need not mention <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> when he asked for your friend M. <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a>, and many others. But (I said) if he wanted to be a praefectus on account of the bond, I would see to his recovering the money. He thanked me and went away. Our friend <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> had granted certain squadrons of cavalry to this <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> to coerce the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a>, and had also given him rank as praefectus. He was harrying the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a>. I ordered the cavalry squadrons to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>. <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> felt aggrieved. In short, to keep faith with him I commanded the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a>, when they came to see me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369349UTar class=place long=34.897 lat=36.9122>Tarsus</a> and <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> with them, to pay the money. They had a great deal to say about the bond, a great deal about the wrongs inflicted upon them by <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>. I declined to hear it. I urged them, I even asked them as a favour, in consideration of my good services to their state, to settle the business: finally I said that I would use compulsion. The men not only did not refuse, but even said that they would be paying out of my pocket: for that, since I had declined the money they had been accustomed to pay the praetor, they would in a sense be paying out of my pocket, and indeed the debt to <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> amounted to considerably less than the praetorian contribution. I warmly commended them: All right, said <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>, but let us reckon the total. Then there arose this question: One of the clauses in my customary edict was a declaration that I would not recognize more than twelve per cent. interest, besides the yearly addition to the capital of interest accrued, whereas he demanded in virtue of the deed forty-eight per cent. What do you mean? said I. Can I go against my own edict? He then produced a decree of the senate made in the consulship of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>. The governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a> shall recognize that bond in giving judgment. I was at first horrified, for it meant the ruin of the town. I find there are two decrees of the senate in the same year about this bond. When the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> wished to raise money at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to pay off a debt, they were prevented from doing so by the Gabinian law. Then it was that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s friends, relying on his influence, offered to advance the money if they were secured by a senatorial decree. A decree is passed by <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s influence That the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> and those who lent the money should be indemnified. They paid the money. Afterwards it occurred to the lenders that this senatorial decree would not secure them, because the Gabinian law forbade a legal decision being based on the bond. So the other senatorial decree (that this bond be recognized in giving judgment) is passed: not giving that particular bond more legal validity than others, but the same. When I had expounded this view, <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> took me aside and said that he had nothing to say against it, but that those men were under the impression that their debt was 200 talents, and he was willing to accept that sum, whereas it really amounted to somewhat less; he begs me to induce them to agree on the 200. Very well, said I. I summon them without the presence of <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>. What do you say, said I, how much is your debt? They answered, One hundred and six. I refer back to <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>. He exclaimed loudly. What is the use of this? said I. Check each other's additions. They sit down, they make their calculations: they agree to a penny. They declare themselves willing to pay: and beg him to accept the money. <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> again takes me aside: asks me to leave the matter as it is, undecided. I gave in to the fellow's shameless request. When the Greeks grumbled, and demanded that they might deposit the money in a temple, I did not assent. Everybody in court, exclaimed that <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> was the greatest knave in the world for mot being content with twelve per cent. plus the compound interest: others said that he was the greatest fool. In my opinion he was more knave than fool. For either he was content with twelve per cent. on a good security, or he hoped for forty-eight per cent. with a bad one. That is my case; and if <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> is not satisfied with it, I cannot see why I should regard him as a friend: I am sure that his uncle at any rate will accept it, especially as a senatorial decree has just been passed — I think since you left town — in the matter of money-lenders, that twelve per cent. simple interest was to be the rate. What a wide difference this implies you will certainly be able to reckon, if I know your fingers. And in this regard, by the way, L. <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>, son of Marcus, writes me a grumbling letter asserting that — thanks to the senate — there is the utmost danger of these decrees leading to a general repudiation. He recalls what mischief C. <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Iulius</a> once did by slightly enlarging the time for payment: public credit never received such a blow. — But to return to the matter in hand: turn over my case in your mind as against <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, if it may be called a case, against which nothing can be decently urged: especially as I have left it and its merits undecided. Now for family matters. As to our home secret, I am of your opinion — <a href=/people/3671 target=_blank>Postumia</a>'s son: since Pontidia is playing fast and loose. But I could have wished you had been there. Don't expect anything from my brother Quintus for some months; for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370332LTau class=place long=33.2 lat=37>Taurus</a> is impassable before June, owing to the snow. I am backing up <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a>, as you ask me to do, by a great number of letters. As for P. <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a>, <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> says that he has nothing, and is being supported by himself. As soon as you know whether there is to be an intercalation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or not, please write me word definitely on what day the mysteries are to take place. I am a little less eager for your letters than if you were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; but yet, after all, I am eager for them. </p>                        </div>

VI, 1) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) LAODICEA, 22 FEBRUARY: I received your letter on the fifth day before the Terminalia (19th of February) at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>. I was delighted to read it, for it teemed with affection, kindness, and an active and obliging temper. I will, therefore, answer it sentence by sentence — for such is your request — and I will not introduce an arrangement of my own, but will follow your order. You say that the last letter you had of mine was from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377342UKyb class=place long=34.2269 lat=37.6621>Cybistra</a>, dated 21st September, and you want to know which of yours I have received. Nearly all you mention, except the one that you say that you delivered to <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>'s messengers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412151UAeT class=place long=15.0985 lat=41.2423>Equotuticus</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. Wherefore your industry has not been thrown away, as you fear, but has been exceedingly well laid out, if, that is to say, your object was to give me pleasure. For I have never been more delighted with anything. I am exceedingly glad that you approve of my self-restraint in the case of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and of my independence even in the case of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>: and I had thought that it might be somewhat otherwise. For <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, in the course of his journey, had sent me two or three rather querulous letters, because I rescinded some of his decisions. It is exactly as if a doctor, upon a patient having been placed under another doctor, should choose to be angry with the latter if he changed some of his prescriptions. Thus <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, having treated the province on the system of depletion, bleeding, and removing everything he could, and having handed it over to me in the last state of exhaustion, he cannot bear seeing it treated by me on the nutritive system. Yet he is sometimes angry with me, at other times thanks me; for nothing I ever do is accompanied with any reflexion upon him. It is only the dissimilarity of my system that annoys him. For what could be a more striking difference — under his rule a province drained by charges for maintenance and by losses, under mine, not a penny exacted either from private persons or public bodies? Why speak of his praefecti, staff, and legates? Or even of acts Of plunder, licentiousness, and insult? While as things actually are, no private house, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, is governed with so much system, or on such strict principles, nor is so well disciplined, as is my whole province. Some of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>'s friends put a ridiculous construction on this, holding that I wish for a good reputation. to set Off his bad one, and act rightly, not for the sake of my own credit, but in order to cast a reflexion upon him. But if <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, as <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter forwarded by you indicated, expresses gratitude to me, I am satisfied. Nevertheless, this very day on which I write this, before dawn, I am thinking of rescinding many of his inequitable appointments and decisions. I now come to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, whose friendship I embraced with all possible earnestness on your advice. I had even begun to feel genuine affection for him — but here I pull myself up short, lest I should offend you: for don't imagine that there is anything I wish more than to fulfil his commissions, or that there is anything about which I have taken more trouble. Now he gave me a volume of commissions, and you had already spoken with me about the same matters. I have pushed them on with the greatest energy. To begin with, I put such pressure on <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a>, that he paid him the talents which he promised me. As long as the king was with me, the business was in excellent train: later on be began to be pressed by countless agents of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Now <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has by himself more influence than all the rest put together for many reasons, and especially because there is an idea that he is. coming to undertake the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war. However, even he has to put up with the following scale of payment: on every thirtieth day thirty-three <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> talents, and that raised by special taxes: nor is it sufficient for the monthly interest. But our friend Gnaeus is an easy creditor: he stands out of his capital, is content with the interest, and even that not in full. The king neither pays anyone else, nor is capable of doing so: for he has no treasury, no regular income. He levies taxes after the method of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>. They scarcely produce enough to satisfy <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s interest. The king has two or three very rich friends, but they stick to their own as energetically as you or I. For my part, nevertheless, I do not cease sending letters asking, urging, chiding the king. <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> also has informed me that he has sent emissaries to him on <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s business: that they have brought him back word that he has not got the money. And, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, I believe it is the case; nothing can be stripped cleaner than his kingdom, or be more needy than the king. Accordingly, I am thinking either of renouncing my guardianship, or, as <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> did on behalf of <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a>, of stopping payment altogether — principal and interest alike. However, I have conferred the prefectures which I promised <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> through you on M. <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> and L. <a href=/people/1745 target=_blank>Gavius</a>, who were acting as <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s agents in the kingdom: for they were not carrying on business in my own province. You will remember that I made that condition, that he might have as many prefectures as he pleased, so long as it was not for a man in business. Accordingly, I have given him two others besides: but the men for whom he asked them had left the province. Now for the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a>, which I see came upon you also as a novelty, as it did upon me. For <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> never told me that the money was his own. Nay, I have his own document containing the words, The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> owe my friends M. <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> and P. <a href=/people/6650 target=_blank>Matinius</a> a sum of money. He recommends them to me: he even adds, as though by way of a spur to me, that he had gone surety for them to a large amount. I had succeeded in arranging that they should pay with interest for six years at the rate of twelve per cent., and added yearly to the capital sum. But <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> demanded forty-eight per cent. I was afraid, if he got that, you yourself would cease to have any affection for me. For I should have receded from my own edict, and should have utterly ruined a state which was under the protection not only of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, but also of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> himself, and had been the recipient of favours from myself. When lo and behold! at this very juncture <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> comes down upon me with a letter from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, stating that his own property is being imperilled — a fact that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> had never told either me or you. He also begged that I would confer a prefecture on <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>. That was the very reservation that I had made to you —  not to a man in business: and if to anyone, to such a man as that — no! For he has been a praefectus to <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and had, in fact, had some squadrons of cavalry, with which he had kept the senate under so close a siege in their own council chamber at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, that five senators died of starvation. Accordingly, the first day of my entering my province, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=demonym long=33 lat=35>Cyprian</a> legates having already visited me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, I sent orders for the cavalry to quit the island at once. For these reasons I believe <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> has written some unfavourable remarks about me to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. However, my feeling is this: if <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> holds that I ought to have decided in favour of forty-eight per cent., though throughout my province I have only recognized twelve per cent., and had laid down that rule in my edict with the assent even of the most grasping money-lenders; if he complains of my refusal of a prefecture to a man in business, which I refused to our friend <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> in the case of your protege <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a>, and to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself in the case of Sext. <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>, without offending either of them; if, finally, he is annoyed at my recall of the cavalry, I shall indeed feel some distress at his being angry with me, but much greater distress at finding him not to be the man that I had thought him. Thus much <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> will own-that he had the opportunity in my court of taking away with him the whole sum allowed by my edict. I will add a fact which I fear you may not approve. The interest ought to have ceased to run (I mean the interest allowed by my edict), but I induced the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> to say nothing about that. They gave in to me, it is true, but what will become of them if <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a> comes here? However, I have granted all this in favour of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, who writes very kind letters to you about me, but to me my-self, even when he has a favour to ask, writes usually in a tone of hauteur, arrogance, and offensive superiority. You, however, I hope will write to him on this business, in order that I may know how he takes what I have done. For you will tell me. I have, it is true, written you a full and careful account in a former letter, but I wished you clearly to understand that I had not forgotten what you had said to me in one of your letters: that if I brought home from this province nothing else except his goodwill, I should have done enough. By all means, since you will have it so: but I assume my dealings with him to be without breach of duty on my part. Well, then, by my decree the payment of the money to <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> is good at law: whether that is just you must judge for yourself — I will not appeal even to <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. But don't think that I have cast your exhortations to the winds: they have sunk deeply into my mind. With tears in your eyes you urged me to be careful of my reputation. Have I ever got a letter from you without the same subject being mentioned? So, then, let who will be angry, I will endure it: for the right is on my side, especially as I have given six books as bail, so to speak, for my good conduct. I am very glad you like them, though in one point-about Cn. <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, son of <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> — you question my history. He, it is true, did not live before the decemvirs, for he was curule aedile, an office created many years after the decemvirs. What good did he do, then, by publishing the Fasti? It is supposed that the tablet containing them had been kept concealed up to a certain date, in order that information as todays for doing business might have to be sought from a small coterie. And indeed several of our authorities relate that a scribe named Cn. <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> published the Fasti and composed forms of pleading — so don't imagine that I, or rather <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> (for he is the spokesman), invented the fact. So you noticed the remark about the action of an actor, did you? You suspect a malicious meaning: I wrote in all simplicity. You say that <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> told you about my having been saluted imperator. But I feel sure that, as you are now in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, you have received my two letters on the whole subject, one from Pindenissus after its capture, another from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, both delivered to your own messengers. On these events, for fear of accidents at sea, I sent a public despatch to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> in duplicate by two different letter-carriers. As to my <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>, I agree with you, and I have written to her and to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> giving my consent. For you have already said in a previous letter to me, and I could wish that you had returned to your old set. There was no occasion to alter the letter you sent by Memnius: for I much prefer to accept this man from Pontidia, than the other from <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a>. Wherefore take our friend <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a> into council. He was always fond of me, and now I suppose all the more so as he is bound to have accepted <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>'s affection for me with the rest of the property he has inherited. <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> often showed how much he valued me, and especially in the trial of Bursa. Indeed you will have relieved me of a serious anxiety. I don't like <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a>'s proviso. For, in fact, there is no state of things that alarms me except just that of which he makes the only exception. But I should have written at great length to you on this subject if you had been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I don't wonder that you rest all your hope of peace on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>: I believe that is the truth, and in my opinion you must strike out your word insincerity. If my arrangement of topics is somewhat random, blame yourself: for I am following your own haphazard order. My son and nephew are very fond of each other. They take their lessons and their exercise together; but as <a href=/people/222 target=_blank>Isocrates</a> said of <a href=/people/225 target=_blank>Ephorus</a> and <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, the one wants the rein, the other the spur. I intend giving Quintus the toga virilis on the <a href=/people/7876 target=_blank>Liberalia</a>. For his father commissioned me to do so. And I shall observe the day without taking intercalation into account. I am very fond of <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>: the boys, however, say that he gets into mad passions. But after all there could not be a man of greater learning, purer character, or more attached to you and me. The praises you hear of <a href=/people/1574 target=_blank>Thermus</a> and <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> are thoroughly deserved: they conduct themselves in the most honourable manner. You may say the same of M. <a href=/people/2174 target=_blank>Nonius</a>, <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>, and myself, if you like. I only wish <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a> had had an opportunity to do the same: for he is an excellent fellow. The rest don't do much honour to <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s policy. Many thanks for commending my case to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. As for Amianus, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> thinks there is no hope. I haven't found a trace of <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a>. <a href=/people/3428 target=_blank>Moeragenes</a> has certainly been killed. I made a progress through his district, in which there was not a single living thing left. I didn't know about this, when I spoke to your man <a href=/people/139 target=_blank>Democritus</a>. I have ordered the service of Rhosian ware. But, hallo! what are you thinking of? You generally serve us up a dinner of herbs on fern-pattern plates, and the most sparkling of baskets: what am I to expect you to give on porcelain? have ordered a horn for Phemius: one will be sure to turn up; I only hope he may play something worthy of it. There is a threat of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s despatch was empty brag: that of <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> had not arrived: when that is read I think the senate will at length be roused. I am myself in serious anxiety. If, as I hope, my government is not prolonged, I have only June and July to fear. May it be so! <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> will keep them in check for two months. What will happen to the man I leave in charge, especially if it is my brother? Or, again, what will happen to me, if I don't leave my province so soon? It is a great nuisance. However, I have agreed with <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> that he should join my camp in full force. He has thirty cohorts of four hundred men apiece, armed in the Roman fashion, and two thousand cavalry. That will be sufficient to hold out till the arrival of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, who in a letter he writes to me indicates that the business will be put in his hands. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> are wintering in a Roman province. <a href=/people/2010 target=_blank>Orodes</a> is expected in person. In short, it is a serious matter. As to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>'s edict there is nothing new, except the proviso of which you said in your letter, that it reflected with excessive severity on our order. I, however, have a proviso in my own edict of equivalent force, but less openly expressed (derived from the Asiatic edict of Q. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>, son of <a href=/people/2779 target=_blank>Publius</a>) —  provided that the agreement made is not such as cannot hold good in equity. I have followed <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> in many points, among others in this — which the Greeks regard as a charta of liberty — that Greeks are to decide controversies between each other according to their own laws. But my edict was shortened by my method of making a division, as I thought it well to publish it under two heads: the first, exclusively applicable to a province, concerned borough accounts, debt, rate of interest, contracts, all regulations also referring to the publicani: the second, including what cannot conveniently be transacted without an edict, related to inheritances, ownership and sale, appointment of receivers, all which are by custom brought into court and settled in accordance with the edict: a third division, embracing the remaining departments of judicial business, I left unwritten. I gave out that in regard to that class of business I should accommodate my decisions to those made at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: I accordingly do so, and give general satisfaction. The Greeks, indeed, are jubilant because they have non-Roman jurors. Yes, you will say, a very poor kind. </p>                        </div>

They, at any rate, imagine themselves to have obtained autonomy. You at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I suppose, have men of high character in that capacity — <a href=/people/5298 target=_blank>Turpio</a> the shoemaker and <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a> the broker! You seem to wish to know how I treat the publicani. I pet, indulge, compliment, and honour them: I contrive, however, that they oppress no one. The most surprising thing is that even <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> maintained the rates of usury entered on their contracts. My line is this: I name a day fairly distant, before which, if they have paid, I give out that I shall recognize only twelve per cent.: if they have not paid, the rate shall be according to the contract. The result is that the Greeks pay at a reasonable rate of interest, and the publicani are thoroughly satisfied by receiving in full measure what I mentioned-complimentary speeches and frequent invitations. Need I say more? They are all on such terms with me that each thinks himself my most intimate friend. However, μηδὲν αὐτοῖς — you know the rest. As to the statue of <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> — what a mass of confusion! But that was just what interested me in your letter. Do you really mean it? Does the present <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> not know that his great-grandfather was never censor? Why, the statue placed at a high elevation in the temple of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Ops</a> had no inscription except CENS, while on the statue near the <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> of <a href=/people/1430 target=_blank>Polycles</a> there is also the inscription CENS, and that this is the statue of the same man is proved by attitude, dress, ring, and the likeness itself. But, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, when I observed in the group of gilded equestrian statues, placed by the present <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, a statue of <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a> with the name of <a href=/people/1678 target=_blank>Serapio</a> inscribed under it, I thought it a mistake of the workman. I now see that it is an error of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>'s. What a shocking historical blunder! For that about <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a> and the Fasti, if it is a blunder, is one shared in by all, and you were quite right to raise the question. I followed the opinion which runs through nearly all historians, as is often the case with Greek writers. For example, do they not all say that <a href=/people/555 target=_blank>Eupolis</a>, the poet of the old comedy, was thrown into the sea by <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a> on his voyage to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>? <a href=/people/132 target=_blank>Eratosthenes</a> disproves it: for he produces some plays exhibited by him after that date. Is that careful historian, <a href=/people/1019 target=_blank>Duris</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, laughed out of court because he, in common with many others, made this mistake? Has not, again, every writer affirmed that <a href=/people/1602 target=_blank>Zaleucus</a> drew up a constitution for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382162PLoc class=ethnic long=16.229 lat=38.216>Locrians</a>? Are we on that account to regard <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a> as utterly discredited, because your favourite <a href=/people/169 target=_blank>Timaeus</a> attacked his statement? But not to know that one's own great-grandfather was never censor is discreditable, especially as since his consulship no <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> was censor in his lifetime. As to what you say about <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> and the payment of the 20,600 sestertia, I hear that <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> arrived in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a> about the 1st of January: but as yet I have not had a word from him. The balance due to me <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> writes me word that he has received; I don't know how much it is, and I am anxious to know. However, we will talk of this later on, and with greater advantage, perhaps, when we meet? But, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, that sentence almost at the end of your letter gave me great uneasiness. For you say, What else is there to say? and then you go on to entreat me in most affectionate terms not to forget my vigilance, and to keep my eyes on what is going on. Have you heard anything about anyone? I am sure nothing of the sort has taken place. No, no, it can't be! It would never have eluded my notice, nor will it. Yet that reminder of yours, so carefully worded, seems to suggest something. As to M. <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, I hereby again repeat that your answer was excellent: I could have wished it a little more positive still. For <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> has sent me a freedman and a carefully written letter about some panthers and also a grant from the states. I have written back to say that, as to the latter, I am much vexed if my course of conduct is still obscure, and if it is not known at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> that not a penny has been exacted from my province except for the payment of debt; and I have explained to him that it is improper both for me to solicit the money and for him to receive it; and I have advised him (for I am really attached to him) that, after prosecuting others, he should be extra-careful as to his own conduct. As to the former request, I have said that it is inconsistent with my character that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/372295UCib class=place long=29.4918 lat=37.1602>Cibyra</a> should hunt at the public expense while I am governor. Lepta jumps for joy at your letter. It is indeed prettily written, and has placed me in a very agreeable light in his eyes. I am much obliged to your little daughter for so earnestly bidding you send me her love. It is very kind of <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> also; but your daughter's kindness is the greater, because she sends the message to one she has never seen. Therefore pray give my love to both in return. The day on which your letter was dated, the last day of December, reminded me pleasantly of that glorious oath of mine, which I have not forgotten. I was a civilian <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a> on that day. There's your letter completely answered! Not as you were good enough to ask, with gold for bronze, but tit for tat. Oh, but here is another little note, which I will not leave unanswered. <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>, on my word, could get a good price for his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> property, unless, perchance, his flute-player is a fixture (for that's his way), and I should like to know in what condition it is. Our friend <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, I hear, has advertised everything for sale except his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> property. I should like to see these men cleared of their embarrassments, <a href=/people/2506 target=_blank>Cestius</a> also, and you may add <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>, to all of whom the line applies, Ashamed to shrink and yet afraid to take. I suppose you have heard of <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s plan for recalling <a href=/people/984 target=_blank>Memmius</a>. Of the debt due from <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413140RSid class=person long=14 lat=41.3>Sidicinum</a> I am not without some hope, though it is a feeble one. <a href=/people/1900 target=_blank>Pinarius</a>, whom you recommended to me, is seriously ill, and is being very carefully looked after by <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>. So there's the answer to your note also. Pray talk to me on paper as frequently as possible while I am at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, where I shall be up to the 15th of May: and when you reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> at any rate send me letter-carriers, for by that time we shall know about the business in the city and the arrangements as to the provinces, the settlement of all which has been fixed for March. But look here! Have you yet wrung out of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> by the agency of <a href=/people/1266 target=_blank>Herodes</a> the fifty <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> talents? In that matter you have, I hear, roused great wrath on the part of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. For he thinks that you have snapped up money rightly his, and that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will be no less lavish in his building at the <a href=/people/6695 target=_blank>Nemus</a> Dianie. I was told all this by P. <a href=/people/4331 target=_blank>Vedius</a>, a hare-brained fellow enough, but yet an intimate friend of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s. This <a href=/people/4331 target=_blank>Vedius</a> came to meet me with two chariots, and a carriage and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and a sedan, and a large suite of servants, for which last, if <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> has carried his law, he will have to pay a toll of a hundred sestertii apiece. There was also in a chariot a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a>-headed baboon, as well as some wild asses. I never saw a more extravagant fool. But the cream of the whole is this. He stayed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> <a href=/people/8488 target=_blank>Vindullus</a>. There he deposited his properties when coming to see me. Meanwhile <a href=/people/8488 target=_blank>Vindullus</a> dies, and his property is supposed to revert to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> <a href=/people/359 target=_blank>Magnus</a>. Gaius <a href=/people/5311 target=_blank>Vennonius</a> comes to <a href=/people/8488 target=_blank>Vindullus</a>'s house: when, while putting a seal on all goods, he comes across the baggage of <a href=/people/4331 target=_blank>Vedius</a>. In this are found five small portrait busts of married ladies, among which is one of the wife of your friend —  brute, indeed, to be intimate with such a fellow! and of the wife of <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> — as easy-going as his name to take this so calmly! I wanted you to know these historiettes by the way; for we have both a pretty taste in gossip. There is one other thing I should like you to turn over in your mind. I am told that <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> is building a propylaeum at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusis</a>. Should I be foolishly vain if I also built one at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>? I think so, you will say. Well, then, write and tell me that that is your opinion. For myself, I am deeply attached to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> itself, I would like some memorial of myself to exist. I loathe sham inscriptions on statues really representing other people. But settle it as you please, and be kind enough to inform me on what day the Roman mysteries fall, and how you have passed the winter. Take care of your health. Dated the 765th day since the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383231ULeu class=place long=23.1717 lat=38.2567>Leuctra</a>! </p>                        </div>

VI, 2) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) LAODICEA, MAY (BETWEEN 1 AND 7) YOUR freedman <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> having come to call on me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a>, and telling me that he was on the point of setting sail to join you, I intrust him with this letter, in answer to the one which I received by <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter-carrier. And first I will answer your last page, which gave me great uneasiness — that is, the account sent you by <a href=/people/1775 target=_blank>Cincius</a> of his conversation with <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>, in which what annoyed me most was <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> saying that the plan had my approbation. Approbation, indeed! I need say no more than this: I wish the bonds uniting our close friendship to be as numerous as possible, though none can be so close as those of personal affection. So far am I from wishing that any one tie between us should be relaxed. He, however, I have often found by actual experience, is accustomed to speak with some asperity on the subjects you mention, and I have also often succeeded in pacifying his anger. That I think you know. In the course of our recent progress, or campaign, if I may call it so, I have often seen him fly into a rage, and often calm down again. What he has written to <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> I don't know. Whatever he meant to do in such a matter, he certainly ought not to have written to a freedman. I will take the greatest care to prevent anything occurring contrary to our wishes and to what is proper. And in a case of this kind it is not enough that each should answer for himself: for instance, the most important role in the kindly work of this reconciliation is that of the boy, or young man, I should say, Quintus: and this I am in the habit of impressing upon him. He seems to me, indeed, to be strongly attached to his mother, as he ought to be, and wonderfully so to you. But the boy's character, though certainly a lofty one, has yet many complications, and gives me enough to do to guide it. Having thus in my first answered your last page, I will now return to your first. That all the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> states possessed a seaboard is a fact that I accepted on the authority of the maps of <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, a respectable writer, and one who has even received your approbation. In his account of <a href=/people/786 target=_blank>Trophonius</a> — put into the mouth of <a href=/people/2153 target=_blank>Chaeron</a> — he criticises the Greeks on many accounts for their persistent clinging to the sea, and he does not except any place in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>. Though I thought well of him as an authority — for he was a most careful inquirer, and had lived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a> — I was yet surprised at the statement, and feeling scarcely convinced of its truth, consulted <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>. He was at first taken aback; but presently, as he thought no less well of <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, than you do of C. <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, and I of M. <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a>, entertained no doubt that we should believe him. His conclusion was that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a> had a seaport called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374217PLep class=place long=21.7248 lat=37.4406>Lepreon</a>; while <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378228UTen class=place long=22.8717 lat=37.795>Tenea</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375219PAli class=place long=21.864 lat=37.532>Aliphera</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380217PTri class=place long=21.687 lat=37.959>Tritia</a> he thought were more recent foundations; and that view he backed up by <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s Catalogue of the Ships, where there is no mention of them. Accordingly, I translated that passage from <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> word for word. I know the form usually employed is Phliasii, and so take care to have it in your copies: that is the form I now have in mine. But at first I was deceived by the analogy of Ὀποῦς Οπούντιοι, Σίπους Σιπούντιοι (so Φλιοῦς Φλιούντιοι <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378226PPhl class=ethnic long=22.648 lat=37.846>Phliuntii</a>), but I have at once corrected this. I see that you rejoice at my equitable and disinterested administration: you would have done so still more, if you had been here. Why, in these very sessions which I have been holding at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378291PLao class=place long=29.109 lat=37.836>Laodicea</a> from the 13th of February to the Ist of May for all the dioceses except that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>, I have effected astonishing results. A great number of states have been entirely released from debt, and many very sensibly relieved: all have enjoyed their own laws, and with this attainment of autonomy have quite revived. I have given them the opportunity of freeing themselves from debt, or lightening their burdens, in two ways: first, in the fact that no expense has been imposed upon them during my government — and when I say no expense I do not speak hyperbolically, but I mean none, not a farthing. It is almost incredible how this fact has helped them to escape from their difficulties. The other way is this. There was an astonishing amount of peculation in the states committed by the Greeks themselves — I mean their own magistrates. I personally questioned those who had been in office in the course of the last ten years. They openly confessed it: and accordingly, without being punished by any mark of disgrace, repaid the sums of money to the communities out of their own pockets. The consequence is that, whereas the communities had paid the publicani nothing for the present quinquennium, they have now, without any signs of distress, paid them the arrears of the last quinquennium also. So I am the apple of their eye to the publicani —  A grateful set, quoth you. Yes, I have found it so. The rest of my administration of justice has not been without skill, while its lenity has been enhanced by a marvellous courtesy. The ease with which I have admitted men to my presence is a new thing in the provinces. I don't employ a chamberlain. Before daybreak I walk up and down in my house, as I used to do in old times as a candidate. This is very popular and a great convenience, nor have I found it as yet fatiguing to me, being an old campaigner in that respect. On the 15th of May I am thinking of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>: having spent the month of June there — pray heaven, in peace! for a serious war on the part of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> is threatening — I mean to devote July to my return journey. For my year of service is finished on the 30th of July: and I am in 'great hopes that there will be no extension of my time. I have the city gazette up to the 15 of March, from which I gather that, owing to the persistence of my friend <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, every kind of business is coming on rather than that of assigning the provinces. Therefore, as I hope, I shall see you before long. I now come to your friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, or rather our friend, since you will have it so. Indeed, I have on my side done everything that I could accomplish in my province, or attempt in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>. Thus I have urged the king in every possible way, and continue to do so, that is to say, by letter — for I have only had him with me three or four days, and in the midst of political troubles, from which I relieved him. But, alike in our personal interviews, and afterwards by very frequent letters, I have never ceased begging and beseeching him for my sake, and advising him for his own. I have had considerable effect, but how much I do not, at this distance from him, know for certain. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a>, however — for upon them I could put pressure — I have brought to consent to pay the entire debt to <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a>, but with interest calculated at one per cent. per month, and not added to the capital each month, but only at the end of each year. The money was actually paid down: <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> would not take it. What do you mean, then, by saying that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> is willing to lose some-thing? He had forty-eight per cent. in his bond. It could not be paid, nor, if it could, could I have allowed it. I hear, after all, that <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> repents his refusal. For as to the decree of the senate which he quoted —  that the money should be recoverable on the bond  — its intention was to cover the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> having borrowed money contrary to the lex <a href=/people/9414 target=_blank>Gabinia</a>. For <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a>'s law forbade the recovery of money so borrowed. The senate accordingly decreed that it should be recoverable on that particular bond. Now this bond has exactly the same validity as all other bonds, not a bit more. I think <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> will acknowledge that my conduct has been quite regular and correct. I don't know about you, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> certainly will. But now I return to yourself. Do you really, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, mean to say — you, the panegyrist of my integrity and punctilious honour — do you venture out of your own mouth (to quote <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a>) to ask me to give <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> cavalry to help him to exact the money? Would you, if you were with me — and you say in your letter that you are sometimes sore at heart to think that you are not with me — would you have suffered me to do so, even if I had wished it? Not more than fifty, you say. There were fewer than that with <a href=/people/1118 target=_blank>Spartacus</a> at first. What misery would they not have inflicted in so weak an island? They would not have done it, do you say? Nay, what did they not do before my arrival? They kept the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=demonym long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminian</a> senators shut up in their chamber for so many days, that some of them died of hunger. For <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> was a praefectus of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, and <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> allowed him some squadrons. Well, then, do you ask me — you, whose face, by heaven! is ever before my eyes when I think of duty and honour — do you, I say, ask me to allow <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> to be praefectus of mine? To let alone the fact that I had resolved that no man in business should be one, and with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s approval of the rule — is such a fellow as that to have squadrons? Why rather than cohorts of the legions? Oh, <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> is spending his money, and is now cutting a great figure! The chief men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=place long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salamis</a>, says he, wish it. I know all about that: for they came to see me even at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a>, and with tears in their eyes told me of the abominable conduct of the cavalry and of their own miseries. Accordingly, I at once sent a letter ordering the cavalry to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a> by a fixed day, and for that, among other reasons, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> have praised me to the skies in their decrees. But where was the need of cavalry? The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/352339PSal class=ethnic long=33.9030525 lat=35.1799505>Salaminians</a> offer payment — unless, by heaven, we choose to use armed force to compel the payment of forty-eight per cent. interest! And shall I ever dare to read or even to touch those books again which you compliment so highly, if I have committed such an act as that? You have indulged your affection for <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> too far in this, too far I repeat, my dearest <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>. Perhaps I have not done so enough: and so I have told <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> that you have written in this sense to me. Now for the rest. I do all I can here for <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, yet only so far as my duty allows, though with a right good will. For I don't dislike him, while to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> I am warmly attached, and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is surprisingly urgent, of whom, by heaven, I grow fonder and fonder every day. You have heard that C. <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> is coming here as quaestor. I don't know what it is, but I don't like that business of <a href=/people/1594 target=_blank>Pammenes</a>. I hope to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in September. I should much like to know the dates of your tours. I understood the silly conduct of C. <a href=/people/265 target=_blank>Sempronius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> from your letter written in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>. In short, I am jealous of the influence of <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>. I wanted to go on chatting, but the day is breaking; the crowd is coming in; <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> is in a hurry. So good-bye, and give my love to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>, when you write, and to our dear <a href=/people/4906 target=_blank>Caecilia</a>, and accept the same from my son. </p>                        </div>

VI, 3) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) CILICIA, JUNE: THOUGH I know of nothing new having happened since I gave a letter for you to your freedman <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a>, yet as I am sending <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I felt obliged to write you something. And first on the subject which causes me most anxiety — not that you can help me at all, for the matter is actually in hand, and you are far away in another part of the world: And in the gulf between Full many a wide sea's wave the south wind rolls. The time is creeping on, as you see — for I am bound to leave the province on the 30th of July — and no successor is named. Whom shall I leave in command of the province? Sound policy and public opinion demand my brother. First, because it is regarded as an honour: next, because no one is fitter: thirdly, because he is the only ex-praetor I have. For <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a>, in accordance with an agreement and bargain — for he accompanied me on that condition — has already left me. No one thinks my quaestor fit for the post. For he is unsteady, loose, and has an itching palm. However, in regard to my brother, the first point is, that I do not think I could persuade him to do it: for he dislikes a province. And, by heaven, nothing can be more disagreeable and tiresome. Then again, suppose him not to like to say no to me, what about my own duty to him? Seeing that a serious war is believed to be actually going on in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, and is thought likely to spread into this province, while there is here no adequate protection, and the ordinary supplies for the year only have been voted, would it seem consistent with natural affection to leave my brother, or with proper prudence to leave some faineant? You see, therefore, that I am in great anxiety, and much at a loss as to the course to take. In short, I never ought to have undertaken the business at all. What a much better province is yours! You will leave it whenever you choose, if indeed you have not already done so, and you can put anyone you choose in charge of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/394204RThp class=place long=20.4 lat=39.4>Thesprotia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403197RCha class=place long=19.7 lat=40.3>Chaonia</a>! However, I have not yet seen Quintus, so as to be quite sure, if I made up my mind to it, whether he could be induced; nor, if he could, am I certain what my real wishes are. That is how this matter stands. The rest is as yet all praise and thanks — worthy of the books you praise so highly. Communities have been put on a sound footing, the publicani have been thoroughly satisfied, no one has been insulted, some few have suffered by a judicial edict, at once just and strict, yet in no case does anyone venture to complain; there has been a campaign deserving of a triumph, but in this matter too I shall do nothing in a spirit of self-seeking, nothing at all indeed without your advice. The last word of the play — the handing over of my province — is the difficulty. But this some god will direct. About events in the city you, of course, know more than I: your news are more frequent and more authentic. I am myself vexed not to get information by a letter from you. For reports of an unpleasant nature reach me here about <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> and about <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a> — not that I see anything to fear as long as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> can stand or even sit: if he only recover his health! But, by heaven! I am vexed for <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> and <a href=/people/1299 target=_blank>Paullus</a>, my own familiar friends! Please, therefore, send me, if you are in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or when you get there, a sketch-plan of the whole position of public affairs to meet me on my way, by which I may mould my conduct, and consider beforehand in what spirit to approach the city. For it is something that a man on his arrival should not be a foreigner and stranger. And then — what I had almost forgotten to mention — about your friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. I have done everything I could for him, as I often mentioned to you in my letters. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=ethnic long=33 lat=35>Cyprians</a> were ready to pay the money. But <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> was not content with twelve per cent. and compound interest reckoned yearly. <a href=/people/642 target=_blank>Ariobarzanes</a> was not more inclined to accommodate <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> for his own sake, than <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> for mine. But I cannot pledge myself for him, for he is a very poor sovereign, and I am at so great a distance from him, that my only weapons are letters, and with these I have not ceased to ply him. The upshot is this: <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, in proportion to the amount of the debt, has been treated more liberally than <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. For <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> this year there has been secured about a hundred talents; <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has had two hundred promised in six months. Again, in the business of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> I can scarcely express the extent of my concessions to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. Why should I trouble myself, then? His friends are men of straw — <a href=/people/6650 target=_blank>Matinius</a> and <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> — the latter of whom, because he did not get some squadrons of cavalry from me wherewith to bully <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, as he had done before my governorship, is perhaps angry with me; or because he is not a praefectus, an office which I bestowed on no one engaged in business, not even on C. <a href=/people/5311 target=_blank>Vennonius</a>, who was my intimate friend, or on M. <a href=/people/3410 target=_blank>Laenius</a>, who was yours. To this principle, which I communicated to you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I have stuck. But of what has a man to complain, who, when he might have taken the money, refused to do so? The other <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> (who is in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap class=place long=35 lat=38.8>Cappadocia</a>) I think I have fully satisfied. Having received the office of military tribune from me, which I had offered him in consequence of a letter from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, he afterwards wrote me word that he did not wish to avail himself of it. There is a certain <a href=/people/1745 target=_blank>Gavius</a>, who, after my offering him a praefectura on the request of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, said and did a good deal meant to reflect upon me — one of Publius <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>'s sleuth<a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>! He neither paid me the compliment of joining my escort when I was quitting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>, nor on his subsequently visiting the camp and being about to leave it did he ask me whether I had any commands, and made no secret of being, I don't know why, no friend to me. If I had regarded such a fellow as one of my praefecti, what would you have thought of me? Was I, who, as you know, never would put up with insolence from the most powerful of men, to endure it from this led-captain? Yet it is more than putting up with a man to bestow on him a place of profit and honour. So, then, this <a href=/people/1745 target=_blank>Gavius</a>, when he saw me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>, as he was starting for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, addressed me in a tone I should scarcely have ventured to adopt to Culleolus: Will you be good enough to tell me, said he, where I am to look for the allowances of a praefectus? I answered more mildly than those present thought I should have done, that it was not my practice to give allowances to those whom I had not actually employed. He went off in a rage. If <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> can be affected by the talk of such a windbag as this, you may love him all to yourself, you will have no rival in me. But I think he will behave as he ought. However, I wished you to be acquainted with the facts of the case, and I have told <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> the story with the greatest minuteness. Generally speaking (between ourselves), <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has never written me a letter, not even the last one about <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, in which there was not something haughty and distant. But you often have on your lips (from <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a>): Then <a href=/people/2622 target=_blank>Granius</a> too Thinks highly of himself and loathes proud kings. However, in that matter he usually stirs my laughter rather than my bile; but he evidently doesn't sufficiently consider what he is writing, and to whom. The young Quintus, I think, and indeed I am sure, read your letter addressed to his father. For he is accustomed, and that by my advice, to open his father's letters, in case there is anything that ought to be known. Now in that letter there was the same remark about your sister as in your letter to me. Imagine the boy's distress! He told me of his sorrow with tears in his eyes. In short, he showed me clearly how dutiful, sweet-tempered, and kind he was, which makes me the more hope that nothing unbecoming will occur. So I wished you to know it. I will not omit the following either. Young <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, at the time of the gladiatorial exhibition at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa class=place long=30.174 lat=38.073>Apamea</a>, behaved in a scandalous and disgraceful manner. For his father's sake I asked him to dinner the day he arrived, and for his father's sake also went no farther. He remarked that he would wait for me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, that we might leave the country together. All right, said I: for what could I say? After all, I don't think he meant what he said. I hope not, indeed, lest I should offend his father, of whom, by heaven, I am exceedingly fond. But if he is to be in my suite, I will so manage him as to avoid giving offence where I least wish to do so. That is all: no, there is this — please send me the speech of Quintus <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a> against M. <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>. Send me a letter as soon as possible. If there is no news, let me know there is none at least by a letter-carrier of yours. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> and your daughter. Take care of your health. </p>                        </div>

There I was disturbed on many accounts — a serious war in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>; serious cases of brigandage in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=place long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicia</a>; difficulty in fixing on any definite scheme of administration, considering that only a few days remained of my year of office; and, greatest difficulty of all, the necessity, according to the decree of the senate, of leaving some one at the head of the province. No one could be less suitable than the quaestor <a href=/people/3891 target=_blank>Mescinius</a> — for of <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> I don't hear a word. Far the best course appears to be to leave my brother Quintus with imperium. But in doing that many disagreeable consequences are involved — our separation, the risk of a war, the ill-conduct of the soldiers, hundreds of others. What a nuisance the whole business is! But let fortune look to it, since any great exercise of reason is out of the question. As for you, since by this time, I hope, you are safe at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, you will as usual be good enough to look after everything which you may understand to affect my interests, especially in regard to my <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>, about whose marriage I have written to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> my decision, since you were in Greece.

The following I will write to you in a more enigmatical style than usual-your sagacity will smell out the meaning: my wife's freedman — you know whom I mean — seemed to me, from a remark he casually let fall the other day, to have cooked his accounts as to the purchase of the property of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=demonym long=17.129 lat=39.081>Crotonian</a> tyrannicide. I really fear that you may kave noticed something. Pray on your sole responsibility, examine thoroughly into the matter and make the remainder completely secure. I cannot express the extent of my fear. Pray let a letter from you fly to meet me.

VI, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TARSUS, 26 JUNE: By this time you must surely be in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; and I rejoice at your safe arrival there, if it is so. As long, in fact, as you were absent from town, you seemed to me farther removed from me than if you were at home, for my own affairs were less known to me, and so were those of the state. Wherefore, though I hope by the time you read this to be far advanced on my way home, pray send letters frequently, and as talkative as possible on every kind of subject, to meet me: above all, on the subject on which I wrote to you before: my wife's freedman, as in our meetings and conversations he continually stammered and seemed at a loss, appeared to me to have a little cooked the accounts of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=demonym long=17.129 lat=39.081>Crotonian</a>. Please run that to earth, as is your wont; but still more the following: When leaving the city of the seven hills he handed in an account of two debts of 24 and 48 minae due to <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>: and entered himself as liable for 24 minae from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=demonym long=17.129 lat=39.081>Crotonian</a>'s estate, and 48 from the property in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/403265LChe class=place long=26.5 lat=40.3333>Chersonese</a>. And having received in legacies two sums of 640 minae, of this he says that not a penny has been paid, though it was all due on the 1st of the 2nd month: but that <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s freedman, the namesake of <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Conon</a>'s father (<a href=/people/155 target=_blank>Timotheus</a>), had entirely failed to provide for the payment of the money. In regard, then, to this money, if possible secure the whole amount, and if not, don't neglect the interest calculated from the above-mentioned day. I have felt much alarm about this all the days I had to endure him. For he visited me to survey the situation, and almost with a hope of something turning up. But when he gave up that hope he quitted me without reason assigned, and with the remark: I yield, 'Twere shame to linger here. And he flung in my teeth the proverb, Never refuse a good offer. See to the surplus, and do the best that can be done in the matter. Although I am now almost at the end of my year's full term of office — for there are only thirty-three days left — I am yet overpowered with anxiety for the province to the highest possible degree. For as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> is in a war fever, and <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> has the burden of an extreme anxiety as to the war in the midst of such bitter private sorrow, and as his legates, quaestor, and friends write to me to come to his aid, though I have only a weak army (the auxiliaries are certainly good, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401330RGal class=ethnic long=33 lat=40.1>Galatians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=ethnic long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycians</a> — for they are the flower of my force), yet I thought it my duty to keep my army as near as possible to the enemy, as long as the decree of the senate allowed me to remain governor of the province. But what pleases me most is that <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> is not importunate; he writes to me about everything rather than this, and the day of my departure is insensibly creeping on. When that arrives there is another problem  — who to put in charge, unless my quaestor Caidus shall have arrived, of whom as yet I have had no certain intelligence. I should like, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, to compose a longer letter, but I neither have anything to tell you, nor can I jest for anxiety. Good-bye, therefore, and give my love to the little maid Atticula and our <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>. </p>                        </div>

He showed real filial feeling in the matter; and though it is true that I earnestly exhorted him to do so, yet my persuasion fell on willing ears Your letter moved us both very strongly. Well! I feel confident that things are as we wish. I have written to you twice about money matters in Greek, and enigmatically — if the letters have but reached you. Of course no active step is to be taken. Yet, by putting plain questions to him about <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s debts, and by urging him to fulfil his obligations to me, you will do some good.

WHILE employed in my province in doing everything for the honour of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, I suddenly became his accuser's father-in-law. Heaven prosper it, you say. So say I, and I am sure you wish it. But believe me, it was the last thing I expected: in fact, I had even sent confidential messengers to my wife and daughter in regard to <a href=/people/70 target=_blank>Tiberius</a> <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, who had made proposals to me; but they arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> after the betrothal had taken place. However, I hope this will be better. I understand that the ladies are much pleased with the young man's accommodating temper and courtesy. As for the rest, pick no holes! But you now! Corn doles to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>? Do you approve of this? However, my treatise at any rate did not forbid it: for that was not a largess to citizens, but a gift to hosts. Yet do you bid me think about the propylon for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a>, though <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> has abandoned his idea about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380235SEle class=place long=23.538 lat=38.0411>Eleusis</a>? I am sure you grieve for <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. I am heart-broken myself: for I had resolved to live on very intimate terms with him. I have put <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> in command of the province: a mere boy, you will say, and perhaps empty-headed, with neither solidity nor self-control. I agree: but nothing else was possible. The letter, indeed, which I received from you a good while ago, in which you said that you hesitated as to what I ought to do about leaving a substitute, gave me a twinge, for I saw your reasons for your hesitation, and I had the very same. Hand over my province to a mere boy? Well, to my brother, then? The latter was against my interest: for there was no one except my brother whom I could prefer to my quaestor without casting a slur on him, especially as he was of noble birth. Nevertheless, as long as the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> appeared to be threatening, I had resolved to leave my brother, or even to remain myself, contrary to the decree of the senate, for the sake of the Republic. But when by incredible good fortune they had dispersed, all my hesitation was at an end. I saw what people would say: What, leave his brother! is this what he calls not holding his province more than a year? Did not the senate, again, intend that the governors of provinces should be those who had not had them before? Yet this man has held one for three years! So here are my reasons for the public ear. What am I to give you privately? I should never have been without anxiety as to something happening from ill-temper, violent language, or carelessness, as will happen in this world. Again, if his son did anything — a mere lad and a lad full of self-confidence? What a distress it would have been! His father was resolved not to part with him, and was annoyed with you for expressing an opinion that he should do so. But as to <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>, as things are, I don't say that I don't care about his antecedents, but at any rate I care much less. Then there is this consideration: <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> — so strong a man and in so secure a position — selected Q. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> without regard to the lot; <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> did the same in the case of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>: was I to put such a slight on one regularly assigned me by lot, as to make him act as a spy on any man I left in command? No, the course I adopted was the better one, and for it there are many precedents, and certainly it is more suited to my advanced time of life. But, good heavens! what credit I have given you in his eyes! I read him the letter written, not by you, but by your amanuensis. My friends' letters summon me to a triumph — a thing which, in view of the resuscitation of my reputation, I do not think I ought to neglect. Wherefore, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, do begin to wish it too, that I may look somewhat less foolish. </p>                        </div>

Batonius, however, brought news about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> that is really terrifying, and he enlarged still more on the subject in Conversation with Lepta. I hope what he said was false, but it is certainly alarming: that he would on no account dismiss his army; that Of the magistrates-elect the praetors, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> the tribune, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> the consul, side with him; that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is thinking of leaving the city.

VI, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ATHENS, 15 OCTOBER: IMMEDIATELY on my landing in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, on the 14th of October, I received your letter from the hand of my slave <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>. Having been long looking forward to it, I was surprised, as soon as I looked at the letter before breaking the seal, at its brevity; when I opened it I was again surprised at the cramped handwriting, for your letters are generally supremely well-written and clear, and, to make a long story short, I understood from the fact of your writing like that, that you had arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 19th of September in a fit of fever. Much disturbed — but not more than I was bound to be — I at once questioned <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>. He said that both you and he thought, and his impression was confirmed by what your people at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> told him, that it could not be anything serious. This appeared to be supported by an expression used by you at the end of your letter, that you wrote while suffering from a slight touch of fever. Yet it roused my gratitude, as well as my surprise, that you should, in spite of it, have written to me with your own hand. So enough about this. For I hope, considering your prudence and temperate life, and, by heaven, I feel confident — as <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> bids me — that by this time you are as well as I could wish. I am glad you have got my letter from <a href=/people/5299 target=_blank>Turranius</a>. Keep an eye, an you love me, and a very keen one, upon the ambition of that cooker of accounts. This legacy again — which I swear is a source of great grief to me, for I loved the man-this legacy of <a href=/people/6852 target=_blank>Precius</a> don't let him lay a single finger upon. You will say that I shall want some ready money for the expenses of the triumph, which, as you advise, you shall find me neither weakly vain in seeking, nor over-modest in declining. I gather from your letter that <a href=/people/5299 target=_blank>Turranius</a> told you that I had handed over my province to my brother. Do you think I so entirely failed to grasp the wise caution of your letter? You said your judgment was in suspense. What could have called for your hesitation, if there had been any reason whatever for deciding that a brother should be left in command, and such a brother? I took your meaning to be dogmatic rejection, not suspension of judgment. You urged in regard to the young Quintus, that I should not leave him in any case. You tell me my own dream. The same points occurred to us both, just as though we had talked it over together. It was the only thing to be done, and your long suspension of judgment relieved me of all doubt. But I fancy you have already a letter on this subject written in more detail. I intend to send off letter-carriers tomorrow, who I think will arrive sooner than our friend <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a>. But it was scarcely decent that he should arrive without a letter from me to you. In your turn, pray fulfil your promise of writing fully to me of my <a href=/people/2948 target=_blank>Tulliola</a>, that is, of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, of politics — which I foresee will be in a very dangerous situation — of the censors, and especially what is taking place about the statues and pictures, whether the matter will be brought before the Senate. I write this on the 15th of October, on which day, you tell me, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is going to bring four legions to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/450097UPla class=place long=9.6931 lat=45.0526>Placentia</a>.

VII, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ATHENS (16 OCTOBER) I did, in fact, give L. <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a> a letter, and to you alone, because, though I had not sufficient time for writing, I was yet unwilling that a man so intimate with you should reach you without a letter from me. But considering the deliberate pace adopted by philosophers, I think the present letter will reach you first. If, however, you have already received the former, you are aware that I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> on the 14th of October: that on disembarking at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>, I received your letter from the hands of <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>: that I was much disturbed at your having arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with a fever on you, but was reassured by <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> bringing the news I wished for as to your convalescence; that I was, however, horrified at what your letter told me of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s legions; and urged you to take care that the φιλοτιμία of him you wot of does us no injury. Lastly, on a subject on which I had long ago written to you, but <a href=/people/5299 target=_blank>Turranius</a> had misinformed you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> — as I learnt from a letter received from that excellent man <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> — I explained briefly why I had not placed my brother at the head of my province. Such was nearly the substance of that letter. Now for the rest. In the name of fortune, do devote all the affection with which you have blessed me, and all the wisdom you possess — which in my judgment is unrivalled on every subject — to considering my entire position. For I think I foresee such a violent struggle — unless the same god, who relieved me from fear of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war by a stroke of luck beyond what I had ventured to hope, shall now show regard for the Republic — such a struggle, I say, as there has never been before. Well! this is a misery which I share with all the world. I don't bid you reflect on that. It is my own, particular problem that I would beg you to take up. Don't you see that it was on your advice that I sought the friend-ship of both? Yes, and I could wish that I had listened to your most friendly hints from the beginning: But in my breast my heart thou couldst not sway. Yet at length, after all, you did persuade me to embrace the one, because he had done me eminent service, and the other, because he was so powerful. I did so, therefore: and by showing them every kind of attention contrived that neither of them should regard anyone with more affection than myself. My idea, in fact, was this — if I were allied with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, I should not hereafter be compelled to take any improper step in politics, nor, if I agreed with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, have to fight with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>: for their union was so close. Now there is impending, as you show, and as I see, a mortal combat between them. Each of them, again, regards me as his own, unless by any chance one of them is playing a part. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, of course, has no doubt: for he rightly judges that his present view of politics has my approbation. From each, however, I received a letter, at the same time as yours, of a kind calculated to show that neither values anyone in the world above myself. But what am I to do? I don't mean in the last resort of all-for, if it shall come to downright war, I see clearly that it is better to be beaten with the one, than to conquer with the other — but as to what will be in actual debate when I arrive: that he be not a candidate without returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — that he dismiss his army. Speak, Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> I What am I to say? Wait, please, till I have an interview with <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>? It is no time for shuffling. Against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? What is to become of all our mutual pledges? For the fact is that I helped him to secure this privilege, having been asked by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/444122PRav class=place long=12.204 lat=44.418>Ravenna</a> to induce <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>, the tribune, to bring in the bill. By <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself, do I say? Nay, by our friend Gnaeus also, in that immortal third consulship of his. Shall I change my opinions? I fear to face not only <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, but also <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> men and women. <a href=/people/783 target=_blank>Polydamas</a> will be the first to blame. Who is he? Why, you yourself, the applauder of my acts and writings. So it seems, then, that during the last two consulships of the <a href=/people/2425 target=_blank>Marcelli</a> I have avoided this trap, when the subject of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s province was before the senate, only to fall now into the very jaws of the danger. Therefore let some one else be called upon flrst for his vote — I am well pleased to be busying myself on something to secure my triumph, and to have an unimpeachable excuse for remaining outside the city. Nevertheless, they will do their best to elicit my opinion. You will perhaps laugh at what I am now going to say. How I wish I were still lingering in my province! I clearly had better have done so, if this was impending. Though nothing could be less pleasant. For I wish you, by the way, to know this — all those virtues displayed at the beginning of my government, which you, too, in your letters, used to praise to the skies, were only skin deep. How far from an easy thing is virtue! Nay, how difficult a lasting affectation of it! For whereas I thought it equitable and a thing of which to be proud, that out of the sum decreed to me for the year's expenses, I left my quaestor C. <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> enough to last a year, and paid back into the treasury 1,000,000 sesterces (8,000 pounds), my staff grumbled, thinking that the whole of this money ought to have been divided among them — that I might be found a better friend of the treasuries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> than of our own. But they did not move me: for my reputation had supreme weight with me. Nevertheless, there is no mark of honour in my power to bestow on any of them that I have omitted. However, all this, to use the phrase of <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, is a digression, though not without its point. For your part, pray think over my position: in the first place, by what contrivance I may preserve <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s good will; in the second, as to my triumph, which, unless the state of the Republic hinders it, I see is feasible. I judge both from my friends' letters and from the supplicatio; for the man who voted against it really voted for more, than if he had voted all the triumphs in the world. Moreover, only one man voted with him who is my intimate friend — <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a>; and another who is annoyed with me — <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a>. Moreover, <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> was both on the committee for drawing out the decree, and also sent me a very gratifying letter as to his vote. Nevertheless, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, in sending me his congratulations on the supplicatio, exults over <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s vote, and yet does not mention what he really said in delivering it, but merely remarks that he voted against my supplicatio. To return to <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a>. You have begun softening his feelings towards me. Complete the process. You have <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a> and <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> with you; I have already written to them, and to <a href=/people/2236 target=_blank>Hirrus</a> himself. For he had mentioned to them in obliging terms that he could have hindered the decree, but was unwilling to do so: nevertheless, he agreed with <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> — my very warm friend — when he delivered his vote in terms highly complimentary to me, but remarked that I had not written to him while writing to everyone else. It was quite true: for he and <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a> were the only people to whom I had not written. So much for public affairs. To return to domestic business, I wish to dissociate myself from that man, He is a complete juggler — a regular son of <a href=/people/520 target=_blank>Laertes</a>: But what is past I leave, though grieved at heart. Let us get what remains on a sound footing. This money, coming from <a href=/people/6852 target=_blank>Precius</a> to begin with — which adds anxiety to my regret — whatever it amounts to, I do not wish to be mixed up with the accounts of mine of which that fellow has the handling. I have written to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, and to <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> himself; to say that whatever money I should collect for the adornment of my expected triumph I should deposit with you. Thus I think there will be no feeling of resentment; but as they choose! Here is another task for you — to consider how I am to set about this business. You gave some indication on this subject in a letter dated from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=person long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and I will back you up in the course you proposed. </p>                        </div>

VII, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 25 NOVEMBER: I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 24th of November, after a sea passage of your fortunate kind: so delightfully Blew from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> the softest of breezes-Onchesmites. There 's a spondaic hexameter for you! You may pass it off as your own before any of our young poets you choose. The state of your health gives me much uneasiness. For your letter indicates that you are really suffering. I, however, knowing your courage, strongly suspect that there is something which absolutely compels you to give in and almost exhausts your strength, although your <a href=/people/568 target=_blank>Pamphilus</a> informed me that one fit of quartan ague had departed, and that another less serious one was approaching. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, indeed, who entered the gate at the same time as I entered the port of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, told me that L. <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a> had informed her at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412143UTre class=demonym long=14.2617 lat=41.2271>Trebulanum</a> that that too had left you. If this is the case, it answers, by heaven, to my highest wishes, and I expect that you have obtained it by your prudence and temperate habits. I now come to your letters, great budgets of which have reached me at the same time, one more delightful than the other, at any rate those that were in your own handwriting. For while I like the handwriting of <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, for its excellent imitation of your own, yet I don't like it for its indication that you are not well. And talking of him, I have left Tiro in at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a>, a young man, as you know, and add, if you please, of excellent character. I have never seen a better. Accordingly, I miss him very much. Though he did not think himself seriously il, I am yet anxious, and rest my greatest hopes in the assiduous attention of <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, of which Tiro has spoken in his letters and many have told me by word of mouth. Moreover, <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> himself felt how much you wished that I should like him. And, in fact, I took great delight in his society: there is a natural vein of humour in the man that is very attractive. I am carrying home his will sealed up with the signets of two <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Ciceros</a> and of the praetorian staff. In their presence he declared you heir to one-tenth, and me to one-fortieth. At <a about=https://topostext.org/place/390208SAkt class=place long=20.7683 lat=38.9509>Actium</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a> <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a> made me a splendid present. Nothing could prevent Quintus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> from going to see the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398203WThy class=place long=20.251 lat=39.581>Thyamis</a>. I am glad you find such delight in your little daughter, and are convinced of the doctrine as to the natural instinct for procreation. For in the absence of this instinct there can be no natural tie uniting man and man, and, without that, social life is impossible. Heaven prosper what we do, quoth <a href=/people/711 target=_blank>Carneades</a>, somewhat indecently, and yet with more modesty than our countryman Lucius and Patro — who in referring everything to a selfish motive, and denying that anything is ever done for another's sake, and teaching that a man's only motive for being virtuous is to avoid evil consequences to himself, not because right is right, do not perceive that they are describing a crafty man, not a good one. But all this, I think, is discussed in those books which you encourage me by praising. To return to business. How anxious I was for the letter, which you said that you gave to <a href=/people/489 target=_blank>Philoxenus</a>! For you had told me that it contained an account of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s conversation at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. Patro delivered it to me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, having received it, I presume, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>. Nothing could have been more delightful. For it contained information about politics, about the great man's opinion as to my uprightness, about the kind feeling towards me which he manifested in what he said about the triumph. But what pleased me more than anything else was to learn that you had visited him to ascertain what his disposition was towards me. This, I say, gave me the greatest pleasure of all. As to the triumph, I never felt any great desire for it till <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>'s utterly bare faced despatch, which was followed by a supplicatio voted in the most complimentary terms. If he had really done what he stated in his despatch, I should have rejoiced and been in favour of bestowing honour upon him. But as it is — that he, who never set foot outside the city gate as long as the enemy was west of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/353403WEup class=place long=40.2708 lat=35.2791>Euphrates</a>, should be specially honoured, and that I, on whose army he depended entirely, should not be able to obtain a similar honour, is an insult to us: I say us, because I include you. Accordingly, I will leave no stone unturned, and, as I hope, shall succeed. But if you had been in good health, I should already have got rid of certain difficulties. But, I hope, you will soon recover. About the debt to <a href=/people/3218 target=_blank>Numerius</a> I am much obliged to you. I am longing to know what <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> has done, and what <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is doing: the latter, it is true, has been disgracefully spiteful to me. He gave his testimony to my integrity, equity, clemency, good faith, which I did not ask for: what I did ask for he withheld. Accordingly, in his letter of congratulation, containing also every kind of promise, how <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> exults over the slight put upon me by <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s signal ingratitude! <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, too, who votes twenty days' supplicatio to <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a>! Pardon me, I cannot and will not put up with this. I am itching to answer all your letters, but it is unnecessary: for I shall see you directly. However, I must just tell you about <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> — for about the other fellow (a mere mechanic) I am less surprised. Yet there could not be a more rascally trick than his either. But <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> — that he, whom I liked seeing and held in honour for his tincture of letters, should abandon my boy without my knowledge! I say nothing about many other things of which I am told; I say nothing of his embezzlements; but I cannot put up with his absconding. It seemed to me the most unprincipled thing in the world. Accordingly, I have availed myself of that ancient expedient of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> when praetor, as it is said, in the case of a man who on being manumitted declined to take the same oaths. I denied having manumitted those men, especially as there was no one present at the time by whom their manumission could legally be maintained. Tell me what you think of that: I will abide by your opinion. The most eloquent by far of all your letters I have not answered, that in which you speak of the dangers of the Republic. What was I to write back? I was much upset. But the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> prevent my being much afraid, who suddenly retreated, leaving <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> half dead with fright. </p>                        </div>

VII, 3) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TREBULANUM (VILLA OF PONTIUS), 9 DECEMBER: ON the 6th of December I reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411150UAec class=place long=15.013 lat=41.0534>Aeculanum</a>, and there read the letter from you which <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> delivered to me. The first glance at it gave me pleasure from seeing that it was in your own handwriting, and presently I was extraordinarily delighted at its extreme minuteness and attention to detail. To begin with, you say you disagree with <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>: but although I sought with the greatest eagerness, and with your approbation, not to remain more than a year in my province, this was not brought about by any exertions on my part. For let me tell you that no proposal was ever made in the senate about any of us governors of provinces, to the effect that we should remain in them beyond the term mentioned in the decree: so that I cannot now be blamed even for having been a shorter time in the province than was perhaps for the good of the public service. But the common expression Perhaps it was all for the best seems to come in pat, as though it were made for the case. For whether a peace can possibly be patched up, or the victory of the loyalists secured, I should wish in either case to lend a helping hand, or at any rate not to be wholly out of it. But if; on the contrary, the loyalists are beaten, I should have been beaten with them, wherever I was. Wherefore the rapidity of my return should be no cause for regret. If, again, the idea of a triumph had not been suggested to me — an idea which you also approve-you certainly would not have found me fall much short of the ideal statesman sketched in the sixth book of my Republic. Well, what would you have me do, you who have devoured those books? Indeed, even now, I shall not scruple to throw this hope aside, great as it is, if it turns out to be the better course. The two things indeed cannot be done at the same time-to canvass for a triumph, and to speak with independence on politics. But do not doubt for a moment that the more righteous course will have the preference in my eyes. For as to your opinion, that it is more advantageous, whether for my personal safety, or as enabling me to serve the state, to retain my imperium — that we will discuss when we meet. For it is a matter requiring serious consideration, though to a great extent I agree with you. About my loyalty to the Republic I thank you for feeling no doubt: and I also quite endorse your judgment that, considering my services to him, and considering what he has done for others, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has been by no means overliberal in his conduct to me. Your explanation of that fact also is the true one, and agrees strikingly with what you say has been done in the case of <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a> and <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a>. Even if things had been different, and he had been profuse in his liberality to me, yet that Guardian goddess of the city, whom you mention in your letter, would have compelled me to remember the inscription upon her statue, and would not have allowed me to imitate <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a> and <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, who satisfy you, but would have compelled me to entertain sentiments and maintain some course worthy of myself: which, indeed, I would have done, if I could, in a different way from that in which I must now act. It is for their own supremacy that these men are now contending, but it is at the risk of the constitution. For if it is the constitution that is being now defended by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, why was it not defended in his own consulship? Why was I, in whose cause the safety of the constitution was involved, not defended in the next year? Why was his imperium extended, or why in that particular way? Why was such a fight made that the ten tribunes should propose a law allowing him to be a candidate in his absence? Owing to these measures he has become so strong, that there is only one citizen with sufficient force to resist him; and I wish that he had refused to grant him all this power, rather than resist him now when he is so strong. But since it has come to this pass, I will not ask, as you say: Where is the hull that once the <a href=/people/1152 target=_blank>Atreidae</a> owed? The one hull for me will be that which has <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> for steersman. Yes, that is just as you say. What is to happen when the consul says: Your vote, Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>? I shall answer in a word: I vote with Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. Nevertheless, in private, I shall exhort <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to keep the peace. For my opinion is that there is the most imminent danger. Of course you are better informed as being in the city. But my view of the situation is this: we have to do with a man of the most consummate boldness, and in the highest state of preparation: all who have been condemned, or branded with infamy, or who deserve condemnation and infamy, are on his side; nearly all the young men; all the lowest city rabble; some influential tribunes, including Gaius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>; all who are overwhelmed with debt, who I find are more numerous than I thought. The only thing this cause lacks is merit: it has everything else in abundance. On our side everyone is doing everything he can to avert an appeal to arms, of which the result is in all cases uncertain, while on this particular occasion there is reason to fear its going the other way. <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> has quitted his province, and has left Veiento in charge of it. I hear he will be somewhat slow on his return journey. In complimenting him <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> remarked that the only people he did not envy were those whose political position admitted of no improvement, or at any rate little. Now for private affairs: for I have pretty well answered your letters on politics, both the one you wrote in your suburban villa, and that which you wrote subsequently. So now I am coming to private affairs. Still, there is one thing more-about <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>. So far from his affecting my opinion, I am strongly of opinion that he must himself be sorry for having changed his views. But how came it that those properties of <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> were conveyed to him? I wonder you passed that over. As to <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>, I will do as you advise. But I was not expecting to have the accounts from him, which he submitted to you, but the balance which he himself, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, wished me to enter in my day-book with my own hand, and for which he also gave me a bill in Asia in his own handwriting. If he paid the sum which be declared to you to be the amount of my debt, he would still owe me as much again, and more. But in business of this kind, if only the state of public affairs permit, I shall not henceforth expose myself to blame; nor, by heaven, was I really careless about it in former times, but my time was swallowed up by a crowd of friends. Accordingly, I shall have the benefit, as you promise, of your assistance and advice, and yet shall not, I hope, be troublesome to you. You need not alarm yourself about the splints I made my staff wear. They have pulled themselves together of their own accord from admiration of my upright conduct. But no one had given me a greater surprise than the man of whom you think so meanly. He had been at the beginning, and at this day still is, excellent. But just at the moment of leaving the province he indicated to me that he had hoped for something. He did not, however, cling to the idea, upon which he had allowed his mind to dwell for a time, but quickly returned to his better self, and being much affected by the extremely high honours bestowed on him by me, he looked upon them as more valuable than any money. I have received his will from <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, and am bringing it with me. I am informed of the legacies <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> has to pay. I am now eager to know the man's position, and what properties he is putting up to auction. For I don't know why, since <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> has monopolized the Porta <a href=/people/7694 target=_blank>Flumentana</a>, I should not make myself owner of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>. Now for the word Piraeea: in using it I exposed myself to severer criticism for writing Peiraeea instead of Piraeum — which is the form adopted by all our countrymen — than for adding an in. For I did not prefix the preposition to the word as the name of a town, but of a locality: and, after all, our friend <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, and <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=person long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, who is with me, did not consider the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a> to be a town. But I will see to it. The fact is that, if I have made a mistake, it is in not speaking of it as a town, but as a place; and for having followed, I don't say <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> (mane ut ex portu in Piraeum), for he is a poor authority for Latinity, but <a href=/people/3260 target=_blank>Terence</a>, whose plays, owing to the elegance of their language, were thought to be written by <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>. He says, Heri aliquot adulescentuli coimus in Piraeum; and also, Mercator hoc addebati...captam e Sunio. Now if we choose to consider demes to be towns, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sunium</a> is as much a town as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Piraeus</a>. But since you are by way of being a grammarian, you will relieve me of much vexation if you solve me this knotty point. He sends me courteous letters. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> does the same for him. I am resolved not to swerve a finger's breadth from the most absolute loyalty in any direction. But you know the balance he has against me. Do you think, then, that some one will twit me with it, if I am lukewarm in opposition, or that he will demand repayment if I am overvigorous? What solution can you find to this? Pay him, you say. Well, then, I will borrow from <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>. However, pray turn this matter over in your mind. For I imagine, if I have at any time made a fine speech in defence of the constitution, that your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/373000PTar class=demonym long=-6.947 lat=37.258>Tartessian</a> friend will say to me as I am leaving the house, Be so good as to direct the money to be paid. What else is there to say? Why, this. My son-in-law makes himself very agreeable to me, to <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>, and to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>. He has any amount whether of ability or culture. We must be content. Other points in his character, with which you are acquainted, must be tolerated. For you know the men whom we have [rejected ], who all, except the one about whom we negotiated through you, think that I am making money. For no one will advance them any on their own credit. But of this when we meet; for it is a subject for a long talk. My hope of Tiro's recovery is centred on <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a>, to whom I said in a letter that you will be very gratefui to him. <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a>'s Villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412143UTre class=place long=14.2617 lat=41.2271>Trebula</a>, 9 December. </p>                        </div>

VII, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) (FORMIAE II DECEMBER): DIONYSIUS was burning with desire to be with you, and I have accordingly sent him, but, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, with great reluctance. However, I was obliged to give way. I have found him, indeed, both a good scholar (which I knew before) and a man of high character, very obliging, careful too of my reputation, honest, and — not to give him only the praise that suits a freedman — a thoroughly good man. I saw <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> on the 10th of December: we were together perhaps two hours. He seemed to me to be much delighted at my return: urged me to a claim a triumph: undertook to do his part: warned me not to enter the senate until I had gained my object, for fear of alienating some tribune by the speeches I delivered. Need I say more? In cordiality of mere language nothing could have been more explicit. On the political situation, however, the tone of his remarks assumed the existence of downright war. He held out no hope of maintaining peace: he had felt before that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was alienated from him, he had recently become quite sure of it. <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s most intimate friend, had been in the neighbourhood, but had not called on him. Moreover, <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> having arrived in the evening of the 6th of December, and <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> having arranged to visit <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> on the 7th, before daybreak, <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> started to rejoin <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> late in the previous night. This seemed to him to be a clear symptom of alienation. In short, nothing else consoles me but the opinion that the man, to whom even his enemies have assigned a second consulship, and fortune has given supreme power, will not be so mad as to put these advantages in danger. But if he once begins to run amuck, I verily have many fears which I do not venture to put into writing. However, as the matter stands at present, I think of approaching the city on the 3rd of January. </p>                        </div>

For they showed your zeal and kindness. I am disturbed by your illness, and <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>'s having fallen ill of the same complaint must, I think, cause you all the more anxiety. So take care, both of you, to get well. I see that you are interested about Tiro. Though he is serviceable to me in a thousand ways, when he is well, in every department of my business and my studies, yet my anxiety for his recovery is founded on his own kindness and high character, rather than on my convenience. <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> never said a word to me about Luscenius. As to other matters, you have <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> with you. I wonder that your sister has not come to Arcanum. I am glad you approve my decision as to <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>. I have no intention of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> at such a time as this. It is out of the way for people coming to meet me, and has other disadvantages. But from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> I mean to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413133UTar class=place long=13.2486 lat=41.292>Tarracina</a> on the 29th of December. Thence to Pomptina Summa, thence to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> villa, and so to the city on the 3rd, my birthday. The political situation gives me greater terror every day. For the loyalists are not, as people think, united. How many Roman knights, how many senators, have I seen prepared to inveigh against the whole policy, and especially the progress through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> now being made by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. What we want is peace. From a victory, among many evil results, one, at any rate, will be the rise of a tyrant. But we will talk of this together before long. At present I have absolutely nothing to write to you about — either in politics (for neither of us knows more than the other) or in domestic affairs, which are equally known to us both. The only thing left is to jest, if this personage will allow us. For I am one who thinks it more expedient to yield to his demands than to fight. For it is too late in the day to be resisting a man, whom we have been nursing up against ourselves these ten years past. What will be your view, then? say you. None, of course, except in accordance with yours: nor shall I express any till I have accomplished or laid aside my own affair of the triumph. So take care of your health. Do at length shake off your quartan fever by exercising the prudence in which no one surpasses you. </p>                        </div>

Let me, then, merely maintain my old habit of never letting anyone going to you depart without a letter. At the political situation I am thoroughly alarmed, and up to now I have found hardly anyone not convinced that it would be better to yield to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s demand than to fight. That demand, it is true, shameless as it is, is more serious than we thought. But why begin resisting him now? For naught more dreadful is upon us now. than when we voted his additional five years, or when we allowed his being a candidate in his absence: for we did not, I presume, give him arms then, that we might have a well-furnished enemy to fight with now! You will say, What, then, will be your view? Not the one I shall express. For my real view will be anything rather than fight: I shall say exactly what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> does. And that I shall do from no abject cowardice: but once more it is a very serious evil to the constitution, and less allowable perhaps in my case than in that of others, that in matters of such importance I should differ from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. </p>                        </div>

VII, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) (FORMIAE, DECEMBER) <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, a most excellent fellow — as I, too, have reason to know — and also a very good scholar and warmly devoted to you, arrived in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 16th of January and delivered me a letter from you. Those are your exact words about <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> in your letter. You don't add, and he expressed his gratitude to you. And yet he certainly ought to have done so, and, if he had, you are always so good-natured that you would have added it to your sentence. However, any palinode in regard to him is made impossible for me, owing to the character I gave him in my last letter. Let him, then, pass for an excellent man. I am obliged to him for one thing at least — he has given me this opportunity also of knowing him thoroughly. <a href=/people/3448 target=_blank>Philogenes</a> was quite correct in what he wrote to you: for he has paid the money due. I wished him to have the use of the money as long as he legally could; accordingly, he has kept it fourteen months. I hope <a href=/people/2185 target=_blank>Pomptinus</a> is recovering and as to having entered the city, as you say in your letter, I feel somewhat anxious as to what he means by it. For he would not have done so except for some weighty reason. As the 2nd of January is the <a href=/people/4494 target=_blank>Compitalia</a>, I don't want to arrive at <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> villa on that day, for fear of inconveniencing his servants. I shall do so, therefore, on the 3rd, and go thence to the city on the 4th. I don't know on what day your quartan fit is due; but I am very unwilling that you should be disturbed to the detriment of your health. As to my triumph, unless <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has been secretly intriguing by means of the tribunes who are in his interest, everything else appears to be going smoothly. My mind however is supremely calm, and regards the whole thing with utter indifference: the more so that I am told by many that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and his council have determined to send me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> on the ground of my having imperium. That is worthy of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd class=place long=24.9833 lat=40.95>Abdera</a>! For neither has the senate decreed nor the people ordered me to have imperium in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. But if the state delegates this to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> why should he send me rather than some unofficial person? So, if the possession of this imperium is going to be a nuisance to me, I shall avail myself of the first city gate I came to. For as to what you say, that my coming is awaited with astonishing interest, and that none of the loyalists, or even the semi loyalists, have any doubt about what I am likely to do — I don't understand whom you mean by the loyalists — I know of none — that is to say no class of such men: for of course, there are individuals who are loyalists; but when it is a case of politic divisions what we have to look for is classes and sets of loyalists. Do you regard the senate as loyalist when it is owing to it that the provinces have no governors' with imperium? For <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> would never have held out if negotiations with him had been set on foot — a measure which the senate refused to adopt with the result that no successor was named to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Or the publicani who, having never been staunch, are now warmly in favour of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? Or the financiers or the farmers, whose chief interest is peace? Unless you can suppose such men to dread being under royal rule, who have never declined it, so long only as they were left in peace and quiet. Well then! Do I approve of votes being taken for a man who is retaining an army beyond the legal day? For my part, I say no; nor in his absence either. But when the former was granted him, so was the latter. Why, do you approve of the ten years' grant, and of the way in which the law was carried? If I do, then I approve of my own banishment, and the loss of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> land, and of the adoption of a patrician by a plebeian, of a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365-063PGad class=person long=-6.266 lat=36.499>Gaditanian</a> by a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391265PMyt class=person long=26.5621 lat=39.1114>Mytilenean</a>; I approve of the wealth of <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> and <a href=/people/5102 target=_blank>Mamurra</a>, of the pleasure-grounds and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. But the fountain-head of all these things is the same. We should have resisted him when he was weak, and that would have been easy. Now we are confronted by eleven legions, cavalry at his desire, the Transpadani, the city rabble, all these tribunes, a rising generation corrupted as we see, a leader of such influence and audacity. With such a man we must either fight a pitched battle, or admit his candidature in virtue of the law. Fight, say you, rather than be a slave. To what end? To be proscribed, if beaten: to be a slave after all, if victorious? What do you mean to do, then? say you. Just what animals do, who when scattered follow the flocks of their own kind. As an <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>ox</a> follows a herd, so shall I follow the loyalists or whoever are said to be loyalists, even if they take a disastrous course. What the best course is in this unfortunate dilemma I see clearly. For no one can be certain of the result when once we come to fighting: but everyone is certain that, if the loyalists are beaten, this man will not be more merciful than <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> in the massacre of the nobility, nor less rapacious than <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> in confiscating the property of the rich. I have been talking politics with you all this time, and I would have gone on doing so, had not my lamp failed me. The upshot is this: Your vote, M. <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>! I vote with Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>: that is, with Titus <a href=/people/639 target=_blank>Pomponius</a>. Pray give my regards to <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a>, that very accomplished boy, unless perchance he has become a man during my absence, for he seemed on the point of doing so. </p>                        </div>

VII, 8) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) (FORMIAE, 26 DECEMBER) WHAT need was there to speak so strongly about <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>? Wouldn't the slightest hint from you have been enough for me? The fact is, your silence had roused all the more suspicion in me, first because your usual custom is to cement friendship by testifying to mutual goodwill, and secondly because I was told that he had spoken to others in a different tone. However, I am quite convinced that the truth is as you say. Accordingly, my feelings towards him are what you wish them to be. The day on which your fit was due I had noted for myself, from a letter which you wrote in the early stages of your feverish attack, and I had calculated that, as things are, you could come to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> villa to meet me on the 3rd of January without inconvenience. But pray do nothing to injure your health. For what does one day or another matter? I see that by <a href=/people/589 target=_blank>Livia</a>'s will <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, takes a third between himself and two others, but is ordered to change his name. Here is a problem in politics for you — can a young man of rank properly change his name in accordance with a woman's will? We shall be able to solve that question in a more scientific spirit, when we know to about how much a third of a third amounts. What you thought would be the case — that I should see <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> before arriving at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — has happened. For he caught me up near the Lavernium on the 25th. We came together to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> and from two o'clock till evening had a private conversation. As to your question whether there is any hope of making peace, as far as I could gather from a long and exhaustive discourse of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s, he hasn't even the wish for it. His view is this: if he becomes consul, even after dismissing his army, there will be a bouleversement of the constitution. Besides, he thinks that when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is told that preparations against him are being pushed on energetically, he will throw aside the consulship for this year and prefer retaining his army and province. But if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> were to act such a mad part, he entertained a low opinion of his power, and felt confident in his own and the state's resources. The long and the short of it was that, although intestine war was often in my thoughts, yet I felt my anxiety removed while I listened to a man of courage, military skill, and supreme influence, discoursing like a statesman on the dangers of a mock peace. Moreover, we had in our hands the speech of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, delivered on the 21st of December, which contained an invective against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, beginning from his boyhood, a complaint as to those who had been condemned, and a threat of armed intervention. On reading this <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> remarked, What do you think <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself will do, if he obtains supreme power in the state, when his quaestor — a man of no influence or wealth-dares to talk like that? In short, he appeared to me not merely not to desire the peace you talk of, but even to fear it. However, he is, I think, somewhat shaken in his idea of abandoning the city by the scandal it would cause. My chief vexation is that I must pay the money to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and devote what I had provided for the expenses of my triumph to that. For it is an ugly business to owe money to a political opponent. But this and much besides when we meet. </p>                        </div>

VII, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) (FORMIAE, 27 DECEMBER) AM I to receive, quoth you, a letter from you every single day? Yes! if I find anyone to give it to, every day. But you are all but here in person. Well, when I have arrived, I will stop writing. I see that one of your letters has not reached me. While my friend L. <a href=/people/2440 target=_blank>Quintius</a> was conveying it, he was wounded and robbed near the tomb of <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a>. Please consider, therefore, whether there was anything in it which I ought to know, and at the same time solve this strictly political problem. Seeing that it is necessary, EITHER that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should be allowed to stand for the consulship while he still holds his army (whether by the favour of senate or tribunes); OR that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should be persuaded to hand over his province and army, and so become consul; OR, if he cannot be persuaded to do so, that the election should be held without admitting his name as candidate; OR, if he employs tribunes to prevent that, and yet makes no warlike move, that there must be an interregnum; OR, if on the ground of his legal candidateship having been ignored he moves up his army, that we must fight him with arms, while he must begin hostilities either at once before we are prepared, or as soon as his friends have their demand for having him recognized as a candidate at the election refused: but that he will either have the one excuse for an appeal to arms (that his candidature is ignored), or will have an additional one, if it chances that some tribune, when vetoing the senate or stirring up the people, is censured, or hampered by a senatorial decree, or forcibly removed, or driven out of the city, or flies to him, alleging that he has been so driven out: SEEING finally, that, if war is once begun, we must either defend the city, or abandon it and try to cut him off from supplies and other resources: consider, I say, which of these evils, some one of which we must confront, you think the least. You will no doubt say to persuade him to hand over his army, and so become consul. Well, certainly against this proposal, supposing him to submit so far, nothing can be said: and, since he doesn't succeed in getting his candidature acknowledged while he still retains his army, I wonder he does not do so. For us, however, as certain persons think, nothing is more to be dreaded than his becoming consul. But I would prefer his being consul on these terms to his being so with an army, you will say. Certainly. But even on these terms, I tell you, there is one who thinks it a grave evil. Nor is there any remedy against it: we must submit if he insists upon it. Imagine him consul a second time after our experience of his former consulship! Why, comparatively weak as he was then, you say, he was more powerful than the whole state. What, then, do you think will be the case now? Moreover, if he is consul, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is resolved to be in Spain. What a sad state of things, when the very worst alternative is just the one which cannot be rejected, and the one which, if he adopts it, would at once secure him the highest favour with all the loyalists! Let us, then, put this out of the question. They say that he cannot be induced to accept it. Which is the worst of the other alternatives? Why, to concede to him what, according to the same authority, is his most impudent demand. For could anything be more impudent? You have held a province for ten years, a time not granted you by the senate, but assumed by yourself with the help of violence and sedition: this period — not assigned by the law, but by your own caprice — has passed. Let us, however, grant that it was by the law: a decree is made for naming your successor: you cry halt and say, Take my candidature into consideration. Rather, do you take us into consideration. Are you to have an army longer than the vote of the people gave it you? You must fight unless you grant it. Certainly — to quote <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> again — and with a fair prospect either of conquering or of dying free men. Moreover, if fight we must, the time depends on chance, the plan on circumstances. Therefore I do not worry you on that point. In regard to what I have said, pray make any suggestion that occurs to you: for my part, I am on the rack day and night. </p>                        </div>

VII, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) (IN CAMPANIA) 19 JANUARY: WHAT in the world does it mean? What is going on? I am quite in the dark. We are in occupation of Cingulum, says some one; we have lost <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancona</a>. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> has abandoned <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Are we talking of an imperator of the Roman people, or of a <a href=/people/14 target=_blank>Hannibal</a>? Madman! Miserable wretch, that has never seen even a shadow of virtue! And he says that he is doing all this to support his honour! How can there be any honour where there is no moral right? Can it be morally right to have an army without commission from the state? To seize cities inhabited by one's fellow citizens, as a means of attacking one's own country? To be contriving abolition of debts, restoration of exiles, hundreds of other crimes For royalty, the first of things divine? Let him keep his fortune, and welcome! By heaven, I would rather have one hour of basking in your free sun than all the royalties of that kind in the world, or rather I would die a thousand times Sooner than once take an idea of that sort into my mind: What if you should take the fancy? say you. Well, everyone's wishes are free: but I regard the mere wish as a greater misfortune than the cross. There is one greater misfortune still — to attain such a wish. But enough of this. It is a kind of relief to philosophize thus much in the midst of such troubles. To return to our friend. In the name of fortune, what do you think of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s plan? I mean in abandoning the city? For I am at a loss to explain it. Nothing, again, could be more irrational. Do you mean to abandon the city? Then you would have done the same if the Gauls were upon us. The Republic, says he, does not depend on brick and mortar. No, but it does depend on altars and hearths. <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> did the same. Yes, for one city was incapable of resisting the flood of the whole East. But <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Pericles</a> did not so act, about fifty years afterwards, for he abandoned everything except the walls. Our own country men in the old times held the citadel, though the rest of the city was taken: Such deeds of fame — so poets told — Our fathers wrought in days of old. On the other hand, I gather from the indignation aroused in the municipia, and the conversation of those whom I meet, that this plan is likely to prove successful in a way. There is an extraordinary outcry — I don't know what people are saying with you, but pray let me know — at the city being without magistrates or senate. In fact, there is a wonderfully strong feeling at <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s being in flight. Indeed, the point of view is quite changed: people are now for making no concessions to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Expound to me what all this means. My department is a very quiet one. For <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> wishes me to be a kind of president of the whole of this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411146RCam class=demonym long=14.6 lat=41.1>Campanian</a> seacoast, to superintend the levy, and hold the chief command. Accordingly, I meditate being continually on the move. I think you must see by this time what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s aim, what the disposition of the people, and the general position of affairs are. Pray write and tell me about them, and that, too, as often as possible, since they are continually shifting. For I find relief both in writing to you and in reading your letters. </p>                        </div>

VII, 12) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 22 JANUARY: As yet I have received only one letter from you dated the 19th, and in it you indicated that you had written another, which I have not received. But I beg you to write as often as possible, not only whatever you know or have been told, but also what you suspect, and above all what you think I ought to do or not to do. You ask me to be sure to let you know what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is doing: I don't think he knows himself, certainly none of us do. I saw the consul <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> on the 21st; I have seen <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>. Nothing but terror and uncertainty everywhere! <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is on the road to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418149ULar class=place long=14.9192 lat=41.8071>Larinum</a>; for there are some cohorts there, as also at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418152UTea class=place long=15.237 lat=41.771>Teanum</a>, and in the rest of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>. After that nobody knows whether he means to make a stand anywhere, or to cross the sea. If he stays in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I am afraid he cannot have a dependable army: but if he goes away, where I am to go or stay, or what I am to do, I don't know. For the man, whose Phalarism you dread, will, I think, spare no form of brutality: nor will the suspension of business, nor the departure of senate and magistrates, nor the Closing of the treasury Cause him to pause. But all this, as you say, we shall know before long. Meanwhile, forgive my writing to you at such length and so often. For I find some relief in it, and at the same time want to draw a letter from you, and above all some advice as to what I am to do and how to conduct myself. Shall I commit myself wholly to this side? I am not deterred by the danger, but I am bursting with vexation. Such a want of all plan! so utterly opposed in every respect to my advice! Am I to procrastinate and trim, and then join the winning side, the party in power? I dread to face the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>, and I am held back from that course by the duty not only of a citizen, but also of a friend, though my resolution is often weakened by pity for my children. Do, therefore, though equally anxious yourself; write something to a man in this state of utter uncertainty, and especially what you think I ought to do in case of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s quitting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, for his part — for we have been together-draws the line at that, and so does L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> I am hampered, among many other things, by my lictors: I have never seen such a hopeless entanglement. Accordingly, I don't expect anything positive from you, but merely your present impression. In fact, I want to know what the precise difficulty in your mind is. It is all but certain that <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> has abandoned him. If it could only have been possible that on coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> had found magistrates and a senate there, he would have been of eminent service to our cause.. For it would have been Clear that loyalty to the Republic had caused him to hold one who was his friend guilty of treason. This is clear even now, but of less practical advantage: for there is no one to be of advantage to, and I expect him to feel some dissatisfaction — unless perchance it is not true, after all, that he has abandoned <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. For myself; I am convinced that it is true. Pray, though you say you confine yourself to the limits of your own house, do give me a sketch of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a>. Is <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> missed? Is there any appearance of a feeling against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? What, too, is your opinion as to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> and <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>? Should they stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, or join me, or seek some place of safety?

VII, 13) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) MINTURNAE, 23 JANUARY: As to the business of <a href=/people/5311 target=_blank>Vennonius</a>, I agree with you. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> I regard as a demigod. There has been no political stroke this long time past more brilliant. If he has done no other good, he has at least given him pain. But as a matter of fact, I do think that some good has been done to the cause. I am charmed also with <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, whose judgment on his son-in-law I think will have weight. But you perceive the nature of the war. It is only a civil war in the sense that it has originated from the unscrupulous boldness of one unprincipled citizen, not as arising from a division of sentiment between the citizens generally. But that man is strong in the possession of an army, he commands the allegiance of many by the prospects he holds out and the promises he makes: nothing that anyone possesses is beyond the scope of his desires. To such a man as this the city has been abandoned, without any garrison to protect it, crammed with every kind of wealth. What would you not have to fear from the man who regards those temples and roofs, not as constituting his fatherland? but as objects for plunder? What his proceedings are going to be, and how they are to be put into any shape, without senate and without magistrates, I cannot tell. He will not be able to keep up even a pretence of constitutional action. For us, however-where shall we be able to raise our heads or when? How utterly incapable our general is you yourself observe, in having had no intelligence of the state of affairs even in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>: and how devoid of any plan of campaign, the facts are witness. For, to say nothing of other mistakes committed during the last ten years, could any terms be worse than such a flight? Nor, indeed, have I any idea what he is contemplating at this moment, though I never cease asking again and again by letter. Everyone agrees that he is in a state of abject alarm and agitation. Accordingly, as far as I can see, there is no garrison — to organize which he was kept at the city walls-nor any place where a garrison could be posted. His whole hope rests on the two legions somewhat treacherously retained, and almost to be regarded as belonging to another. For as yet, indeed, those whom he is enlisting are men reluctant to serve and averse from fighting. While the time for making terms has been let slip. I do not see what is going to happen. At any rate we, or our leader, have allowed things to come to this pass, that, having left harbour without a rudder, we must let ourselves drift before the storm. So I hesitate as to what to do with my son and nephew: sometimes I think I had better despatch them to Greece. For <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> and <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, again — when I see a vision of barbarians arriving in the city — I am filled with all kinds of alarm; but when I think of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, I breathe again somewhat. But pray consider what you think ought to be done: in the first place, with an eye to their safety — for I must regard their security as requiring to be considered in a different light from my own-secondly, with a view to popular opinion, that I may not be blamed for deciding that they should remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, when the loyalists generally are flying from it. Nay, even you and <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a> — for he has written to me — must take care what you' do. You are men of such shining characters, that the same line of conduct is expected from you as from the noblest citizens. But I can safely leave this to you, since it is to you that I look for advice for myself and my family. All I have to add is to ask you to find out, as far' as you can, what is going on, and to write me word of it, and — what I expect from you even more — tell me what you are yourself able to conjecture. The best prophet, you know. Pardon my running on like this: it is a relief to me when writing to you, and draws a letter from you. </p>                        </div>

I think <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself must have acted with the purpose of throwing ridicule on the affair, in trusting a message on matters so important to such a man as this — unless, perchance, he never did intrust it, and the fellow has, without warrant, made use of some conversation which he picked up as a message. <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, a man of noble character in my opinion, arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418152UTea class=place long=15.237 lat=41.771>Teanum</a> on the 22nd.

His proposal was accepted, but on condition of his withdrawing his garrisons from the towns which he had occupied outside his province.

For if I get into any difficulty about my son-in-law, though I am not bound to be responsible for him, yet it is made worse by my women folk having remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> longer than others. Please let me know what you and Sextus are thinking of doing as to leaving town, and what your opinion is on the whole situation. For my part, I never cease urging peace, which, however unfair, is better than the justest war in the world. But this is in the hands of fortune. </p>                        </div>

VII, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CAPUA, 26 JANUARY: EVER since I left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I have not let a single day pass without sending you something by way of letter; not because I had anything particularly to write about, but in order that I might chat with you in my absence, than which — since I cannot do so face to face-nothing gives me greater pleasure. On arriving at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 25th — the day before I write this — I met the consuls and many members of the senate. All were anxious that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should stand by his offer, with the addition of withdrawing his garrisons. <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> alone disapproved of any conditions being imposed on us by him; but he was not listened to in the discussion. For even <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> himself now prefers slavery to fighting. However, he says that he wishes to be in the senate when the terms are debated, if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> can be induced to withdraw his garrisons. So he is not eager about going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> — the very thing most wanted: but he does wish to be in the senate, where I fear he will only do mischief. <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a>, moreover, who was definitely named in the senatorial decree to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> at once and succeed <a href=/people/7695 target=_blank>Furfanius</a>, says that he will not go without <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, and thinks very highly of his own personal service and influence in the senate. Accordingly, this duty has fallen to <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>. He is being sent in advance to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> with imperium. In our discussions a great variety of opinion is expressed. Most declare that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will not abide by his offer, and say that these demands were only thrown in by him to prevent our making the necessary preparations for war. I, however, am of opinion that he will carry out the withdrawal of the garrisons. For he will have gained his point if he is elected consul, and gained it with less crime than that of his first step. But we must put up with the blow: for we are scandalously unprepared both in regard to soldiers and money. All the latter, indeed-not only private money in the city, but the public money in the treasury also — we have left for him. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has started to join the <a href=/people/1420 target=_blank>Appian</a> legions. He has <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> with him. I am anxious to hear what you think of these events.

About <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s message and the arrival of <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, and about the consuls' and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s answer, I told you in the letter of the 26th of January from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, and I put a good deal more information into the same packet. At present we are in suspense on two points: first, what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will do when he has received the answer intrusted to L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to take to him; and, secondly, what <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is doing now. The latter, indeed, writes me word that in a few days he will have a strong army, and leads me to hope that, if he makes his way into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, we shall return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

I have been ordered to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> by the consuls on the 5th of February.

VII, 17) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 2 FEBRUARY: YOUR letter is both welcome and delightful. I thought of sending the boys to Greece when there seemed an idea of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s flying from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>: for I should have made for Spain, which would not have been equally suitable for them. For yourself and Sextus, it seems to me that even now you may remain with propriety at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For you are not at all bound to be my <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s friends. For no one ever did more to detract from the value of city property! Do you see that I am absolutely joking? You ought now to know what answer L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is taking back from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and what sort of a letter he is conveying from him to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: for they were drawn up and despatched with the express purpose of being exposed for public perusal. 'On this point I blamed <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in my own heart for having trusted our friend <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> with the writing of a despatch so important and certain to come into everybody's hands, though he has a very good style of his own. Accordingly, I never read anything more <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402264USes class=demonym long=26.4172 lat=40.2284>Sestian</a>. Nevertheless, it is made quite clear from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s despatch that nothing is denied to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and that all his demands are conceded to the full: he will be a sheer madman if he declines the very proposals which it required the most consummate impudence ever to have made! Pray, who are you to say, If he goes to Spain, if he dismisses the garrisons? Nevertheless, the concession is being made: with less dignity, indeed, at this time of day — for it is after the Republic has actually been violated by him and its territory invaded-than if he had some time back obtained his demand to be reckoned a candidate; and yet I doubt his being content even with these concessions. For, after giving that message to L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he ought, until he received the answer, to have somewhat relaxed his warlike movements, whereas he is said to be at this moment more active than ever. <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a>, indeed, writes to say that on the 22nd of January he was asked by him to write to me, urging me to remain at the city walls: that I could not oblige him more. This was put at great length. I calculated by reckoning the days that, as soon as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> heard of my departure, he began to be anxious lest we should all leave town. Therefore I have no doubt he has written to <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, and also to <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. One thing I am surprised at, that he has not written to me himself; nor opened his communication with me through <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> or <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>: not that I disdain a letter from <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a>, whom I know to be singularly attached to me. I wrote back to <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> — for I wouldn't write to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself; as he had not written to me — pointing out how difficult that course was for me at such a time as this; that I was, however, at my own country seat and had not undertaken any levy or any active part in the affair. By this I shall abide, as long as there is any hope of peace. But if war really begins, I shall not be wanting to my duty or position, after despatching my boys to Greece. For I perceive that all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> will be blazing with war. Such the mischief that is caused partly by disloyal, partly by jealous citizens! But how far this will go I shall learn within the next few days by his answer to mine. Then I will write to you at greater length, if there is going to be war: but if there is to be peace, or even a truce, I shall, I hope, see you in person. On the 2nd of February, on which I write this, I am expecting the ladies at my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=demonym long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formian</a> house, whither I have returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. I had written to them on your advice to remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>; but I hear that there is some increase of panic in the city. I mean to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 5th of February, in accordance with orders from the consuls. Whatever news reaches me here from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> I will let you know at once, and shall expect a letter from you as to what is going on at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

I wished them, till we knew whether we were to have a dishonourable peace or an unhappy war, to remain in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=demonym long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formian</a> villa, and our two boys with them. I myself, with my brother, am starting for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 3rd of February, on which I despatch this letter, to join the consuls, having been ordered to be there on the 5th. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s answer is said to be popular and to have received the approbation of a public meeting. I thought that would be the ease. If <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> refuses to accept that he will be entirely discredited: if he accepts it! Which, then, do you prefer? you will say. I would have answered the question if I knew what our state of preparation was. It is reported here that <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> has been driven from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/436135PAnc class=place long=13.51 lat=43.61>Ancona</a>, and that city occupied by our men. If there is to be war, that will be an advantage. As for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself; say that, though he sent L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> with a message as to making peace, he continues holding levies with the greatest activity, occupying posts, securing them with garrisons. What an unprincipled bandit! What a disgrace to the Republic, hardly to be outweighed by any relief from war! But let us cease anger, bow to circumstances, and accompany <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to Spain. It is the best of a bad job, since we failed to avert that man's second consulship from the state, even when we had the opportunity. But enough of this. I forgot to write to you about <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> before; but I have come to the conclusion to wait till <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s answer is known, so that, if I return to the city, he should await me there, but, if there is any delay, I should summon him to join me. Of course I know what his duty will be in case I have to fly, and what will be the conduct becoming a man of learning and a friend: but I don't expect too much in this way from Greeks. However, if; as I hope will not be the case, I have to send for him, pray see that I am not troubling an unwilling man. Quintus is anxious to pay you his debt by drawing on <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a>, and <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a> is neither unwilling nor short of cash; but when the state of things is such that Quintus <a href=/people/1599 target=_blank>Titinius</a> — of whom we are seeing a good deal-declares that he has no money for personal expenses, and has yet announced to his debtors that they may go on with the same interest, and when L <a href=/people/2322 target=_blank>Ligur</a> is said to have done the same, and when Quintus at this crisis has no cash in hand, and is neither able to get any from <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a> nor to raise a new loan, he is surprised that you do not take into consideration this general tightness of the money market. For my part, though I obey the pseudo-<a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiodic</a> maxim, Judge not, etc., especially in the case of yourself; whom I have never seen to act unreasonably, yet I am affected by his tale of woe. Whatever this amounts to, I thought you ought to know it. </p>                        </div>

I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> for the 5th of February, in accordance with the order of the consuls. Late on that day <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> arrived; the other consul had absolutely not come on the 7th. For I left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on that day and stayed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UCal class=place long=14.1322 lat=41.2>Cales</a>. From that town I am sending this letter, before daybreak, on the 8th. What I ascertained while at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> was that the consuls are no good: that no levy is being held anywhere. For the recruiting officers do not venture to show their faces, with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> close at hand, and our leader, on the contrary, nowhere and doing nothing; nor do recruits give in their names. It is not goodwill to the cause, but hope that is wanting. As to our leader Gnaeus — what an inconceivably miserable spectacle! What a complete breakdown! No courage, no plan, no forces, no energy! I will pass over his most discreditable flight from the city, his abject speeches in the towns, his ignorance not only of his opponent's, but even of his own resources — but what do you think of this? On the 7th of February the tribune C. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> came with an order from him to the consuls that they should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, remove the money from the reserve treasury, and immediately quit the town. After leaving the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a> they are to return! Under what guard? They are to come out of the City! Who is to give them leave to do so? The Consul (<a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>) wrote back to say that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> must himself first make his way into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>. But the fact is, that district has already been entirely lost. No one knows that except myself, who have learnt it from a letter of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s. I have no manner of doubt but that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is all but actually in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a>, and our friend Gnaeus already on board ship. What I am to do is a great problem, though it would have been no problem to me, had not everything been most disgracefully mismanaged, and without consulting me in any way; problem, however, it is, as to what it is my duty to do. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself urges me to promote peace. But his letter is dated before he began his violent proceedings. <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> and <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> both say that he is well satisfied with my conduct. I am on the rack of perplexity. Assist me by your advice if you can, but all the same look after your own interests to the utmost of your power. In such a total upset I have nothing to say to you. I am looking for a letter from you. </p>                        </div>

About <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> I know nothing, and I think he will be caught, unless he has already embarked. What incredible rapidity! Whereas our general's — but I cannot find fault with him without sorrow, for whom I am in an agony of anxiety. You have good reason for fearing a massacre: not that anything could be less in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s interest, with a view to the permanency of his victory and supremacy, but I can see at whose bidding he is likely to act. To be safe, my opinion is that we must go. As to those Oppii of yours, I don't know what to advise. Do what seems to you to be best. You should speak to <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>, and besides, you will have <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> on the 13th. But what am I to do? On what land or sea am I to follow a man, when I don't even know where he is? After all, how can I do so by land? And by sea — whither? Shall I surrender myself to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> then? Suppose I could do so with safety — and many advise it — could I with honour also? Assuredly not. Am I, again, to ask advice of you, as my custom is? There is no way out of the tangle. Still, if anything occurs to your mind, please write, and tell me also what you mean to do yourself. </p>                        </div>

For my part, I fear that these are dreams. However, <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, Gaius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, who are staying with me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>, are quite restored to life by <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>'s letter. I, however, am afraid that the truer account is this: that we are all now practically captives; that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is on the point of abandoning <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, of whom, indeed (what a bitter pill to swallow!), <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is said to be actually in pursuit. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> pursue <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>? What, to kill him? Merciful heavens! and don't we rush as one man to throw our bodies in the way? You, too, must sigh at that! But what are we to do? We are utterly beaten, trapped and taken. However, after reading <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>'s letter, I changed my plan as to the ladies, whom, as I wrote you word, I intended sending back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. It has occurred to my mind that it would give rise to much talk to the effect that I already showed my opinion about the fortunes of the party, and that, regarding it as desperate, I had in this return of my ladies made a kind of first step towards my own return. As for myself, however, I agree with you that I should not commit myself to an indefinite and dangerous flight, by which I should do no good to the Republic or to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, for whom I can die with as much cheerfulness as loyalty. I will remain, therefore. But to go on living — -! You ask what is going on here. The whole business of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, and the levy in this neighbourhood, are at a standstill. There is complete despair. Everybody is preparing to fly, unless some such incident occurs as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> effecting a junction of his forces with those of <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>. But I think we shall know all about it in two or three days. I send you a copy of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter to me; for you asked for it. Many have written to tell me that he is much pleased with me. I don't mind that, so long as I abstain — as I have as yet-from doing anything discreditable. </p>                        </div>

For the nearer the opponent begins to approach, the prompter ought you to have been in effecting a junction with me, before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had the opportunity of preventing your march or throwing himself between us.

The report about <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> is good, about Atranius splendid. Thank you for your most friendly advice to keep myself uncommitted as long as possible. You add that I should not give the impression of being too much inclined to the evil side: certainly I may possibly seem to be doing so. I refused to take a leading part in a Civil war, as long as negotiations for peace were going on, not because it was not a just one, but because former conduct of mine, which was much more fully justified, had done me harm. I was, of course, quite unwilling to have as my enemy a man to whom our own leader had offered a second consulship and a triumph — and in what high-flown terms! In consideration of the extraordinary brilliancy of your achievements. I am well aware both of whom to be afraid and on what grounds. But if there is to be war, as I see there will be, I shall not fail to play my part. As to the twenty sestertia, <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> has answered you. I did not wish to trouble <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> as long as I thought that I should be on the move. However, I made no answer to your frequent remarks about his duty to me, because I expected day after day to be able to settle what was to be done.

For that gallant and influential man, L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, is not with me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>: I think he has started to join you. Anyhow, according to your most recent directions, I went to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the same day as you left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UTea class=place long=14.0673 lat=41.2521>Teanum</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413140RSid class=place long=14 lat=41.3>Sidicinum</a>: for you had expressed the wish that I should superintend operations there in conjunction with the praetor M. <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a>. On my arrival in that town, I saw that Titus <a href=/people/3334 target=_blank>Ampius</a> was holding a levy with the greatest energy, that <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> was taking over the men from him, who is also a man of very great energy and influence in that colony. I remained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> as long as the consuls did. I visited <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> a second time, in accordance with an order of the consuls, on the 5th of February. After staying there three days I returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>. At present I am ignorant of your designs and plan of campaign. If you think that this coast is to be held, which offers many advantages and is an important district, with illustrious citizens residing in it, and is capable, I think, of being held, there must be some one to command in it. But if everything is to be concentrated in one spot, I feel no hesitation about joining you at once. I wish for nothing more earnestly than that, and so I told you the day we quitted the city. For my part, I do not trouble myself about anyone's thinking that I have as yet been less active than I ought, so long as you do not think so: nevertheless, if, as I am convinced is the case, we have to fight, I feel confident of being able to justify myself to all the world. I have sent my connexion M. <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> to you, to receive a letter, if you think it well to write to me. </p>                        </div>

VIII, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 16 FEBRUARY: AFTER I had despatched a letter to you, I received one from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. I would have sent you the letter itself; had not my brother's servant been in such a hurry to start. I will send it, therefore, tomorrow. The rest of it contained the operations in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>; about what <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> had written to him; about the levy held by <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> — all of which are known to you, but yet were not so flourishing as <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>'s letter had represented. But at the end of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s letter there was a sentence in his own handwriting: I am of opinion that you should come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>; you will not be safer anywhere else. The interpretation I put on this is that he considers the towns in this district and the sea-coast as abandoned, nor am I surprised at a man, who has given up the head, having no regard for the other limbs. I wrote back at once and sent the letter by one of my establishment upon whom I could rely, saying that I did not want to know where I should be safest: if he wished me to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a> for his own sake or for that of the Republic, I would come at once; and I urged him to keep a hold upon the seacoast, if he wished to be supplied with corn from the provinces. I see that it is no use my writing this. But as before in regard to keeping the city, so in regard to not abandoning <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I put my opinion on record. I perceive, indeed, that the plan is to concentrate all forces at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>, and even that not as a permanent centre, but that, if hard pressed, we are to abandon that also. You need not, therefore, be much surprised at my not being very enthusiastic about engaging in a cause, in which no provision has ever been sought for making peace or securing victory, but from the first for a discreditable and calamitous flight. I must go, to encounter any danger that chance may bring with those who are reputed to be loyalists, rather than be thought to disagree with loyalists. Yet I foresee that before long the city will be crammed with the loyalists, that is, the fine gentlemen and men of property-crammed chock full, indeed, when these municipal towns have been abandoned. And I would be in their number if I had not these confounded lictors. Nor should I be dissatisfied to have as my companions <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, L. <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a>, and <a href=/people/11077 target=_blank>Servius Sulpicius</a>: not one of them is a greater fool than L. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, nor more of a weathercock than <a href=/people/11074 target=_blank>Appius Claudius</a>. The one person who makes me hesitate is <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, not from his personal importance, but for old sake's sake. For what weight can he have in this controversy? When we were all alarmed at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, he, for his part, was devoted to him: now that he has begun to be alarmed at him, he thinks that everybody ought to be his enemy. However, I shall go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>, and yet perhaps my arrival will not give him any satisfaction. For I shall not be able to conceal my disapproval of what has been done up to this time. If I could sleep I wouldn't have pestered you with such long letters. If you are similarly affected, pray pay me back in kind. </p>                        </div>

DOMITIUS AHENOBARBUS (IN CORFINIUM) LUCERIA, 16 FEBRUARY GNAEUS POMPRIUS, proconsul, salutes Lucius <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, proconsul. M. Calenius has brought me a despatch from you dated the 16th of February, in which you say that your intention is to watch <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and, if he commences his march upon me by the coast road, to come to me with speed into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a>; but that, if he spends time about the towns in your district, you wish to resist him in case of his approaching you. I think your plan is spirited and gallant; but I am compelled to be more solicitous as to whether we may not, if divided, be unequal to our opponent; since he has large forces and is likely soon to have larger. For a man of your foresight ought not to reckon how many cohorts <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has at this moment against you, but what amounts of infantry and cavalry he is likely to collect before long. This is proved in my eyes by a letter from Bussenius to me, in which he says — as I learn from other letters also — that <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> is drawing the garrisons in <a href=/people/9930 target=_blank>Umbria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=place long=10.5 lat=43>Etruria</a> together, and marching to join <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Now if all these forces are combined, even suppose a detachment is sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a>, and another threatens you, and though <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should not offer battle, but should remain on the defensive in his own strongholds, you will still be at a stand, and will not be able, isolated with a force the size of yours, to offer a resistance to such vast numbers sufficient even to allow of your foraging for corn. Wherefore I strongly urge you to come here as soon as possible with your entire force. The consuls have decided to do so. I sent a message to you by M. Tuscilius to say that we must take care that the two legions should not, without the cohorts from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>, be allowed to come within sight of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Wherefore do not disturb yourself if you hear that I am making a backward movement, should <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> chance to advance towards me: for I think I must by all means avoid being caught in the toils and prevented from stirring. For I cannot construct a camp owing to the season and the disposition of my soldiers, nor is it proper to call in the garrisons from all the towns, lest I should be left without a place of retreat. Accordingly, I have not mustered more than fourteen Cohorts at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>. The consuls are about to bring in all garrisons to me, or are going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. For I must either have an army sufficiently strong to make me feel sure of being able to break out, or hold districts of such a kind as to enable us to act on the defensive. At the present time we have neither, for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has occupied a large part of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and we have an army neither as well-appointed nor as large as he has. We must therefore be careful and look to the main interests of the Republic. I urge on you again and again to come to me at the earliest opportunity with your whole force. We may even now restore the fortunes of the state, if we conduct our operations in common: if we are divided we shall be weak. I am quite satisfied of this. After I had written the above, <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> brought me a despatch and message from you. You urged me to come to you: I do not think that I can do so, because I don't feel great confidence in these legions. </p>                        </div>

What I thought and warned you of is now taking place, namely, that at present he would not give you battle, and yet would hem you in by concentrating all his forces, to prevent the road to me being open to you, and your being able to unite your troops, formed of the strongest loyalists, with the legions of whose fidelity we are doubtful. I am therefore all the more disturbed by your letter. For I am not sufficiently confident in the good disposition of the soldiers, whom I now have with me, to risk a battle involving the safety of the state, nor have the levies made by the consuls as yet come in. Wherefore do your best, if it is still by any means possible, to extricate yourself, and Come here as soon as you can, before our opponent is joined by all his forces. For it is neither possible for the new levies to arrive here quickly, nor, if they had arrived, can it escape your observation how impossible it is to trust men, who are not even acquainted with each other, against veteran legions. </p>                        </div>

Being of opinion that if we were scattered we could neither be of service to the state, nor protect ourselves, I sent a despatch to L. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> that, if possible, he should join me with all his men, and that, if he felt doubtful about himself, he should send me the nineteen cohorts which were on the march to join me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a>. What I feared has taken place: <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> is surrounded, and is not in sufficient force to form a camp, because he has my nineteen and his own twelve cohorts distributed among three towns — for he has stationed some at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> and some at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420139USul class=place long=13.9256 lat=42.0468>Sulmo</a> — and he cannot now extricate himself even if he wished. In these circumstances I am, I can assure you, in extreme anxiety. I am eager to relieve men who are so numerous and of such high position from the danger of a siege, and yet I cannot go to their assistance, because I do not think that we can trust these two legions to go there — of whom, after all, I have not been able to keep together more than fourteen cohorts; for I have sent two to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and I did not think that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> ought to be left in my absence without a garrison. I had told <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> to suggest to you, as I hope for an increase to my numbers, that one of you should join me, the other go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> with the force you have collected at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> and the neighbourhood of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, and the soldiers whom <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> has recruited: that <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> with his own twelve cohorts should form a junction with the same, and that all other forces of every description should muster at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and be shipped thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413194PEpi class=place long=19.4449 lat=41.3164>Dyrrachium</a>. But as it is, since at this juncture I cannot go, any more than you, to the relief of <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, he must extricate himself by crossing the mountains, and I must be careful not to allow the enemy to get near these fourteen cohorts, whose loyalty is doubtful, or to catch me up on the march. Wherefore I have determined — and I find that <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and other senators who are here agree with me — to march the force I have with me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. I urge you to collect all the troops that you can collect, and come to me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> also as promptly as possible.

VIII, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 17 FEBRUARY: THANK you all round-both for writing to tell me the remarks you had heard, and for not believing what reflected upon my energy, and, lastly, for letting me know your opinion. I wrote only one letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> in answer to the remonstrance he addressed to me on the subject of his gladiators. My letter was short but expressed in friendly terms. So far from containing any attack upon <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, it mentioned him in the most complimentary terms. This exactly corresponded with my sentiment in favour of his making terms with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. If he has sent that letter anywhere, let him placard it for everyone to read with all my heart. I am writing a second letter to him on the same day as I write this to you. I cannot do otherwise than write, since he has written to me both by his own hand and by that of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. I am sending you a copy of it. I don't think there is anything for you to find fault with. If there is, suggest how I am to escape criticism. Don't write at all, you will say; how better elude those who want to make up a story? Well, I will follow your advice as long as it is possible. You exhort me to remember my deeds, words, and even my writings: it is truly friendly on your part, and I thank you warmly for it; but you appear to me to take a different view from mine as to what is right and suitable to my character in this controversy. For in my opinion nothing more discreditable was ever done in any nation by anyone professing to be a statesman and leader, than the course taken by our friend. I am sorry for him. He abandoned the city, that is, his country, for which, and in which, it would have been a glorious thing to die. You don't seem to me to appreciate the magnitude of this disaster: for you are at this moment in your own town house. Yes, but you cannot remain there any longer except by the consent of the vilest of men. Can anything be more humiliating, more shameful than that? We are wandering about in distress with wives and children. All our hopes are dependent on the life of one man, who has a dangerous illness every year. We are not expelled, but summoned from our country, which we have left not to be safe-guarded till our return, but to be plundered and fired. There are not so very many with me, nor in suburban houses, nor suburban parks, nor in the city itself — and if they are there now, they soon will not be. I meanwhile shall not stay even at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, but at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>, and shall, of course, abandon the care of the sea-coast at once. I shall wait to see what <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> and <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> do: for <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> lacks distinction. Here you will hint that that is just what you find lacking in me. I say nothing about myself. I will leave that to others. In these circumstances, indeed, where is it to be found? All you loyalists are sticking to your houses, and will do so. In the old times didn't every loyalist come forward to support me? Who does so now in this war, for so it must now be called? As yet <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> has covered himself with glory. You will learn all about that from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s letter: in which please notice the passage at which you will find a mark of attention. You will see what <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a> himself thinks about our friend Gnaeus. What, then, is the point of all this talk? Why, I am capable of dying cheerfully for <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>: I value him more than anyone in the world. But, for all that, I do not think that all hope for the Republic is centred in him. You express an opinion also considerably different from your usual one, that I must even quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> if he does so: a step which, in my judgment, is of advantage neither to the Republic nor to my children, and, what is more, neither right nor morally justifiable. But why do you say, Will you be able to endure the sight of a tyrant? As though it mattered whether I heard of him or saw him; or as though I needed to look for any better precedent than that of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, who at the time of the Thirty never set foot out of the city gate. I have personally also a special motive for remaining, concerning which I wish to heaven I might some time have a talk with you. After writing this on the 17th, by the same lamp as that in which I burnt your letter, I am leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> to join <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, with some prospect of being of use if there is any question of peace, but if it is to be war — what good shall I be? </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.8.3'><b>&sect; Att.8.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCXXXII (Att. VIII, 3) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CALES, 18-19 FEBRUARY: A PREY to the gravest and most depressing anxieties, though I am precluded from discussing the question with you personally, I have, nevertheless, resolved to seek your advice. The whole question in debate is this: if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> quits <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, which I suspect that he is about to do, what do you think I ought to do? To assist you in giving me advice, I will state briefly what occurs to my mind on either side. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s very great services in securing my restoration and the intimacy existing between us, as well as the interests of the Republic themselves, lead me to the conclusion that my policy or, if you choose, my fortune must be united with his. Then there is this: if I stay here and desert that company of most loyal and illustrious citizens, I must come under the power of one man: and although he shows by many instances that he is well disposed to me — and you yourself know what precautions I took in that direction, because I suspected the storm that was hanging over our heads-yet I must look at the matter in two lights: first, how far I can trust him; and, secondly, however certain I may be that he will be my friend, whether it is the action of a brave man and a good citizen to remain in a city, in which, after having enjoyed the highest offices and commands, after having performed the most important services, and been invested with the most august priesthood, he is to become a mere name, and to incur danger, not perchance unaccompanied by some disgrace, if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> ever restores the constitution. So much for that side. Now for the other. Our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has shown neither wisdom nor courage in anything that he has done: I may add that he has acted in every case against my counsel and advice. I put out of the question the old scores: how he fostered <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> against the Republic, promoted, armed him; assisted him in the passing of laws by violence and against the auspices; supported the addition of farther Gaul to his provinces; married his daughter; acted as augur at the adoption of Publius <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>; showed greater zeal in effecting my recall than in preventing my exile; supported the extension of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s provincial government; championed his cause at every point in his absence; actually in his third consulship, when he started being a defender of the constitution, yet urged the ten tribunes to propose the bill allowing <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s candidature in his absence; confirmed the same privilege in a certain law of his own, and resisted the consul Marcus <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> when he proposed to fix the end of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s government on the 1st of March. Well, to pass over all this, what could be more discreditable, more ill-considered, than this departure from the city, or I should rather call it this most shameful, most unprincipled flight? What terms could there be that were not preferable to the abandonment of one's country? The terms offered were bad. I confess it: but could anything be worse than this? But (you say) he will recover the Republic. When? What preparation has been made for realizing that hope? Is not <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430135RPic class=place long=13.5 lat=43>Picenum</a> lost? Is not the road to the city laid open? Is not all money public and private, handed over to his opponent? In fact, there is no cause to support, no forces to support it, no rallying point for those who wish the constitution maintained. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> has been selected, the most sparsely peopled district of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and the most widely removed from the point of attack in this war: it is evident that, from sheer desperation, the object in view is flight and the facilities of a sea-coast. I undertook <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> with reluctance, not because I desired to shirk that duty, but because it was in a cause in which there was no openly expressed grievance on the part of the orders in the state or of private individuals, though there was some-far from keen, as usual — on the part of the Optimates; and because, as I saw for myself, the multitude and the lowest of the people were inclined to the other side, while many were eager simply for change. I told <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself that I would undertake no duty without a guard and money. Accordingly, I had practically nothing to do at all, because, from the first, I saw that his sole object was flight. If I am to follow that flight now, whither am I to go? Not with him; for when I started to join him, I learnt that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was in such a position that I could not reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a> safely. I should have to sail by the Mare Inferum, without definite direction and in the worst possible weather. Again, am I to take my brother, or only my son without him, or how? Either alternative involves very great difficulty, and the keenest distress of mind. Again, what kind of attack will he employ against us and our property in our absence? Something more violent than in the case of others, for he will perhaps think that he has a chance of winning popularity by damaging us. Consider, again, these fetters — I mean my laurelled fasces — what a nuisance to carry them out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>! Moreover, what place, even suppose I enjoy a calm passage, will be safe for me till I reach <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>? By what route, again, or whither to go, I have no idea. If, on the other hand, I keep my ground and find some footing on this side, I shall have done what L. <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> did during the tyranny of <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>, as well as L. <a href=/people/236 target=_blank>Flaccus</a> and Q. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>. Though it turned out unhappily in the case of the latter, he used, nevertheless, to say that he foresaw the result (a result which did actually happen), but preferred it to approaching the walls of his native city in arms. <a href=/people/253 target=_blank>Thrasybulus</a> acted differently and perhaps better. But yet there are good grounds for <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>'s line of policy and opinion, as well as for that of the other, namely, to temporize, when necessary, and not to let slip an opportunity when it is given. But even if I adopt this course, those same fasces involve a difficulty. For suppose he is my friend, which is uncertain, but suppose he is, he will offer me the triumph. Not to accept I fear will get me into trouble with him, to accept I fear will appear scandalous to the loyalists. What a difficult and insoluble problem ! you say. And yet I must solve it. For what can possibly be done else? Don't think me more inclined to remain, because I have used more words on that side. It may very well be, as happens in many investigations, that one side has the superiority in words, the other in truth. Wherefore please give me your advice, on the understanding that I am considering a most important matter with impartiality. There is a vessel at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412135UCai class=place long=13.5773 lat=41.2071>Caieta</a> ready for me, and another at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. But here come couriers, as I am in the act of writing these words at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UCal class=place long=14.1322 lat=41.2>Cales</a> before daybreak: here comes a letter stating that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>, that <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> is inside <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a> with a strong force eager to fight. I can't believe that our friend Gnaeus will go so far as to abandon <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, though he has sent <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> in advance to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> with two cohorts, and has written to the consuls saying that he wishes the legion enrolled by <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> to be taken to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> by a consul. But it will be shameful if <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> is abandoned when imploring to be relieved. There is a certain hope, no great one in my mind, but warmly entertained in these parts, that <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> has fought a battle with <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/426007LPyr class=place long=0.658 lat=42.632>Pyrenees</a>; that <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> has been repulsed; that your friend <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> also has come over with his cohorts. The chief hope, however, is that <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a> is on his way hither with large forces. If that is the case, we shall perhaps stay in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. However, since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s line of march was uncertain, as he was thought to be intending to go either in the direction of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>, I am sending Lepta with a letter to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and am returning myself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> to avoid falling in with anyone. I wished you to know this, and I am writing in a somewhat quieter frame of mind than I mentioned just Now: my object being not to put forward a judgment of my own, but to ask yours. </p>                        </div>

The course of that fortune, however, as far as it can be affected by human wisdom, I shall pilot with a certain amount of skill. What honour, what consideration, what recommendation even to others (the contemptible fellow!) has he not had at my hands? Why, I even preferred to have my judgment attacked by my brother Quintus, and by the world in general, rather than not praise him to the skies: and that my young <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Ciceros</a> should have some supplementary lessons from myself, rather than look out for another master for them. Good heavens! what a letter I wrote to him! what respect, what affection did it express! You would have said that it was an invitation addressed to a <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> or an <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>, not to the greatest windbag and worst teacher in the world. But he has a good memory. He shall find I have a better! He answered my letter in a tone which I never used to anyone whose case I declined. I always used to say, If I can, If I am not prevented by a previous engagement: I never had a defendant so low, so mean, so clearly guilty, so utterly a stranger to myself, that I refused him with the abruptness which he has used without disguise or reserve to me. I never saw such gross ingratitude, a vice which embraces every other. But enough and to spare about him. I have a vessel ready: yet I wait for a letter from you, to know what answer it will contain to the case I put to you for advice.

For what else am I to think? However, it is his way to repent when he has done anything intemperate: and he never was more insane than in this business. For — a circumstance I did not mention to you before — I heard afterwards that at the third milestone from the city he took fright, after Venting his horns' vain fury on the air, I mean, after uttering a number of curses, which, as the saying is, I hope may come home to roost! But see what a good-natured man I am! I put into the packet along with the letter to you one addressed to him, written with great warmth: this I should like returned to me, and for that sole reason I have sent my body-servant Pollix to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>.

He brought me a copy of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s letter to the consuls. I have received a despatch from L. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> on the 17th of February. I append a copy. Now, without my saying a word, I know you understand of your own accord how important it is to the Republic that all troops should be concentrated in one place at the earliest possible time.

As to my remark, which you praise and declare to be memorable, that I preferred defeat with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to victory with those others, it is quite true: I do prefer it — but it is with the <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> as he was then, or as I thought him.

I thought honour had flashed before his eyes, and that he — the real man he ought to be — had exclaimed: So let them try each sleight they may against me, And every craft their cunning can devise: The right is on my side. But our hero, bidding a long good-bye to honour, takes himself to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, while <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, they say, and those with him, on hearing of this, surrendered. What a lamentable thing! Distress prevents my writing any more to you. I wait for a letter from you. </p>                        </div>

VIII, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 25 FEBRUARY: YOU say my letter has been widely published: well, I don't care. Nay, I myself allowed several people to take a copy of it. For such is the nature of events that have already happened and are about to happen, that I wished my sentiments as to keeping the peace to be put on record. Now, while exhorting <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of all people to keep it, I could see no better way of influencing him than by saying that it was suitable to his wisdom. If I called that wisdom admirable, seeing that I was urging him to the preservation of our country, I am not afraid of being thought guilty of flattery, when for such an object I would gladly have thrown myself at his feet. Where, again, my expression is bestow some of your time — that does not refer to peace, but it is a request to him to reflect in some degree on my own case and on my obligations. As to my protesting that I have taken no part in the war, though that has been proved by facts, yet I mentioned it that my persuasions might have the greater weight, and my expressing approval of his claim has the same object. But what is the use of discussing this now? I only wish it had done any good! Nay, I should not object to have the letter read in public meeting, since <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> himself, when also writing to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, put up for public perusal the despatch in which are the words Considering the extraordinary brilliancy of your achievements. What! more brilliant than his own, or those of <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>? Circumstances made it necessary to say so. Well, since two men of your character are going to meet him at the fifth milestone, pray, to what does he pledge himself, what is he doing or going to do? With what greater confidence will he rely upon the merits of his case, when he sees you, and men like you, not only in crowds, but with smiles on your faces, and congratulations on your lips? Are we, then, doing wrong? Not at all, as far as you are concerned. Yet, nevertheless, there is an end of all distinguishing between the signs of genuine and pretended feeling. What decrees of the senate do I foresee !-But I have spoken more openly than I intended. I mean to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> on the 28th, then to go the round of my country houses, which I have no hope of ever seeing again. Your frank policy — which is yet not without a spice of caution to suit the times-has my warm approbation. <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, for his part — for we spend almost every day together, much to his gratification-never liked the idea of leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> much less. For letters from him frequently pass from others to me. But it is not so much their opinions that move me: for they have given much fewer pledges to the Republic than I have: it is your influence, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, that has the greatest weight with me; for it suggests a means of retrieving the past and of securing the present. But I appeal to you: what could be more wretched than that the one gains applause in the worst possible cause, the other nothing but anger in the best? That the one is esteemed the preserver of his enemies, the other the betrayer of his friends? And, by heaven, however much I love our Gnaeus, as I do and am bound to do, yet I cannot commend him for failing to relieve such men. For if it was fear, what could be more cowardly? If, as some think, it was because he thought that his own position would be improved by their massacre, what could be more unfair? But a truce to these reflexions: I only increase my grief by recalling them. On the evening of the 24th <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> the younger called on me, hastening on a secret mission to the consul <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, with a letter, a message, and a promise of a province, to induce him to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I don't think he will be persuaded except by a personal interview. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> also told me that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wished, above all things, to catch up <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> (I believe that much), and to be reconciled to him. This latter I do not believe, and I much fear that all this clemency is only an elaborate preparation for a <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a>-like massacre. The elder <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, indeed, writes me word that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would wish nothing better than to live in safety, with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> as chief citizen. You believe that, I suppose! But while I am writing these words (25th February), <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> may have reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>; for he started in light marching order in advance of his legions on the 19th, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>. But this portent is a man of frightful vigilance, rapidity, and energy. I haven't an idea what will happen. </p>                        </div>

VIII, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 27 FEBRUARY: You think me thoroughly upset by a violent mental struggle. I am so, indeed, but not by one so violent as you perhaps imagine. For all my anxiety is lightened as soon as I have either made up my mind, or found on reflexion that a solution is impossible. However, one may express regret. Well, I do so, after all, from one day's end to another. But considering the uselessness of this, I dread being an absolute discredit to my philosophy and my writings: I therefore spend all my time in considering what the virtue of that ideal character is, which, according to you, I have delineated in my books with considerable care. Do you remember, then, that ideal director of the commonwealth to whom we would refer all questions? In the fifth book, I think it is, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> thus speaks: For as the object of a pilot is a successful voyage, of a physician bodily health, of a commander victory, so the object of such a director of the commonwealth is the happiness of the citizens, that it should be secure in means of defence, opulent in material resources, splendid in reputation, untarnished in its virtue. For my idea of him is that he should carry to perfection the work which is the greatest and best among men. Such a conception never occurred to our friend Gnaeus in former times, and least of all in this controversy. Supremacy has been the object of both; there has been no idea of securing the happiness and virtue of the citizens. Nor, indeed, did he abandon the city because he was unable to protect it, nor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> because he was driven from it; but his idea from the first was to stir up every land and sea, to rouse foreign princes, to bring barbarous tribes in arms into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, to collect the most formidable armies possible. For some time past a kind of royalty like <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s has been the object in view, and this is the eager desire of many who are with him. Do you suppose that some understanding between the two, some bargain has been impossible? Today it is still possible. But the object of neither is our happiness: both want to be kings. This brief exposition of the situation I have made in response to your invitation: for you wished me to explain to you my sentiments as to these unhappy circumstances. I speak prophetically, then, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, not in vague denunciation like hers, whom no one believed, but foreseeing in imagination: E'en now upon the mighty deep, etc. What I can prophesy, I repeat, is much the same: such an <a href=/people/12111 target=_blank>Iliad</a> of miseries is there hanging over our heads. Besides, my position is worse than that of those who have crossed the sea with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in this, that they fear one or the other; I fear both. Why have I stayed, then? you will say. From obedience to you, if you like, or from failing to meet him in person, or because it was a juster course. You will see, I tell you, our poor <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> trodden under foot next summer, or in the hands of the slaves of both leaders gathered from the four corners of the earth. It is not a proscription (which is said to have been frequently threatened in the talk at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=place long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Luceria</a>) that is so much to be feared, as a general destruction: so vast are the forces which I see will take part in the conflict on both sides. That is my conjecture of what is to happen. But you perhaps looked for something consoling from me. I can find nothing of the sort. Nothing can exceed the misery, ruin, and disgrace. You ask me what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> said in his letter to me. The usual thing: he was much obliged by my having remained neutral, and begged me to continue to do so. The younger <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> brought me a message to the same effect. The latter was on his way to visit the consul <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> with a letter from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and promises of rewards if he would return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But, when I calculate the days, I think he will have crossed over before he could be met by <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. I wished you to appreciate the slovenly style of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s two letters sent to me, and my great care in writing my answer. I am sending you copies of them. I am anxious to see what this dash of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> accomplishes. Oh that it might turn out something like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> affair!

Meanwhile, before my letter could have reached you, being informed of your design from your message sent through <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a> <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> to the consuls, I did not wait for a letter from you to reach me, but with all promptitude began my journey to join you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> with my brother Quintus and our sons. When I had reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UTea class=place long=14.0673 lat=41.2521>Teanum</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413140RSid class=place long=14 lat=41.3>Sidicinum</a> your intimate friend Gaius <a href=/people/5790 target=_blank>Messius</a>, and several others besides, told me that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was on his march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, and was going to halt that very day at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416142UAes class=place long=14.2267 lat=41.5899>Aesernia</a>. I was much disturbed, because, if that were so, I thought not only that my journey was barred, but that I myself was fairly caught. So I went no farther than <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UCal class=place long=14.1322 lat=41.2>Cales</a> at that time, intending to wait there, rather than elsewhere, till something certain was reported to me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416142UAes class=place long=14.2267 lat=41.5899>Aesernia</a> in regard to this information. But at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UCal class=place long=14.1322 lat=41.2>Cales</a> a copy of your letter to <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, the consul, was brought to me. The substance of this was that you had received a despatch from L. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> on the 17th of February, a copy of which you appended, and added that it was of the utmost importance to the state, that all forces should concentrate in one place as early as possible, and that he should leave a sufficient garrison at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>. When I read this letter I thought, and everybody else agreed with me, that you were about to proceed in full force to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>, to which place, since <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was encamped against it, I did not think that there was a safe road for me. Whilst waiting in the greatest suspense for farther news, I heard two items of intelligence at the same time — what had happened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>, and that you had commenced your march to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>: and though neither I nor my brother had any hesitation as to hurrying on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, we were warned by many coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410163RApu class=place long=16.3 lat=41>Apulia</a> to be on our guard against being intercepted by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, since, having started for the same district as that to which we were going, he was likely to arrive at his destination even quicker than we could. That being the case, neither I nor my brother, nor any of our friends, thought it right by rashness on our part to run the risk of injuring not only ourselves, but the state also; especially as we felt sure that, even if the road proved safe to ourselves, we could not, after all, possibly catch you up so late as this. Meanwhile I received a letter from you dated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a>, 20th of February, in which you urged me to make still more haste to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. As I received this on the 27th, I felt sure that you had already arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and I saw that the road there was entirely closed to us, and that we were as completely prisoners as those at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>. For I do not count as prisoners those only who have fallen into the hands of armed men, but those also quite as much who, being barred from certain districts, find themselves between garrisons and within the lines of another. That being so, my first and greatest desire would have been never to have been separated from you, and, indeed, I showed you my wish when I resigned the charge of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>: which I did not do to escape a burden, but because I saw that that city could not be held without troops, and I did not wish to meet with the mischance which I grieve to see has befallen some very gallant gentlemen. Since, however, I had not the good fortune to be with you, would that I had been kept informed of your design! For I could not possibly guess it, being always accustomed to think that the last thing in the world to happen would be that this cause of the Republic should fail in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, while we had you as our leader. Not, however, that I am now finding any fault with your policy, but I lament the fortune of the Republic; and yet, if I fail to see your object, I do not on that account feel less certain that you have done nothing without the most careful calculation. I think you remember what my opinion has ever been, in the first place, as to maintaining peace at any price, however unfair; in the second, as to the city-for as to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, you had never given me any indication of your purpose. But I do not claim for myself that my policy ought to have prevailed: I followed yours, and that not only for the sake of the Republic — of which I despaired, and which has already been overthrown, and cannot be restored without a most mischievous civil war — but I wanted you: it was with you that I wished to be; nor will I omit any opportunity of securing that, if any such occurs. I was quite aware that in the whole controversy I was failing to satisfy men who had set their hearts on war. For, in the first place, I openly avowed that I preferred peace to everything, not because I was not afraid of the same things as they were, but because I regarded them as less formidable than civil war. In the second place, after the war had begun, when I saw that conditions of peace were being offered you, and a conciliatory and liberal answer was being returned by you to those proposals, I took my special case into consideration, a consideration which I thought in view of your kindness to me I should have no difficulty in justifying in your eyes. For I remembered that I was the one man who, in return for the most eminent services to the state, had suffered the most afflicting and cruel punishment; the one man who, if I offended him — to whom, in spite of our being actually in arms, a second consulship and a most splendid triumph was being offered-would be exposed to the same contests as before: for my person seems ever to present a favourite mark for the attacks of disloyal citizens. Nor were my suspicions premature: threats of this sort have been openly made to me: and I was not so much afraid of them, if I had to face them, as convinced that I ought to avoid them, if that could be done with honour. You have now a resume, as brief as possible, of my policy during the time that there was any hope of peace: for the time following events made me powerless. But I have an easy answer to those who find fault with me. I have never been more devoted to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> than they, nor they more devoted to the Republic than I. The difference between them and me is this: while they are loyal citizens, and I deserve the same honourable title, I wished the controversy settled by diplomacy (as I know you did too), they wished it settled by arms. But since the latter method has won the day, I will take care that the Republic shall not miss in me the spirit of a citizen, nor you that of a friend. </p>                        </div>

However, I preferred dictating this letter to letting <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>, who is a very affectionate friend of us both, have no line to deliver to you. Yesterday, indeed, I wrote with my own hand, as best I could, the letter whose prophecy I hope may be falsified. The motive, however, of the present letter is not only to prevent any day passing without writing to you, but the more reasonable one of inducing you to devote a little time to me. It won't take you long, and so I do much wish to have your view explained to me in such a way, that I may thoroughly understand it. I have not yet committed myself in any respect. I have been guilty of no omission which does not admit of a sound, not merely a plausible, excuse. For certainly I did not make a mistake when I refused to accept the charge of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> without a garrison, in my wish to escape not only the crime of failure, but the suspicion of treachery as well; nor when, after the terms had been brought by L. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/5007 target=_blank>Fabatus</a>, I was careful not to offend a man to whom <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was offering a consulship and triumph, though both were in arms. Nor, indeed, can anyone fairly find fault with my last step in not crossing the sea. For on this measure, though it was a thing to be considered, I have not had the opportunity of embarking. For I had no right to suspect what he was going to do, especially as from <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s own letter — as I see was your own opinion also — I felt no doubt of his intention to go to the relief of <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>. In point of fact, I preferred to have a longer time to consider what was the right course and what I ought to do. First of all, then, I wish you would write and tell me more distinctly — though you have already made it pretty clear — what you think of all this; and, secondly, that you would look into the future and give me a sketch of what you think ought to be my role, and where you think I could be of most service to the Republic; whether a pacific part is required, or whether everything depends on a man of war. And, indeed, though my standard is always duty, I yet remember the advice you once gave me, which, if I had followed, I should not have endured the sad disaster of that crisis in my life. I remember what you urged me to do on that occasion through <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a>, through <a href=/people/2860 target=_blank>Culleo</a>, and I have often recalled it with a sigh. Therefore let me at last revert to the calculation, which I then rejected, and see how I may follow a course which will not simply aim at glory, but will conduce somewhat more to my safety also. But I make no stipulation with you. I want you to write me your opinion in plain terms. I want you also to investigate with all the diligence you can — and you will have men through whom you can do so — what our friend <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> are doing or intending to do, what their present bearing is, whether they find fault with anyone, or are angry with anyone. Why do I say anyone? I mean, of course, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Certainly <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> lays all the blame on <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, as may be seen in his letter, of which I send you a copy. These things, then, be so good as to look into, and, as I asked you in a previous letter, send me the book On Concord, by <a href=/people/12268 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397227RMag class=person long=22.9 lat=39.4>Magnesia</a>, which he sent you. </p>                        </div>

CORNELIUS BALBUS TO CICERO (AT FORMIAE) ROME, FEBRUARY: I entreat you, my dear <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, to undertake a task and a project in the highest degree worthy of your high character — to recall <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to their former cordiality, who have been alienated by the treachery of others. Believe me, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will not only put himself in your hands, but will also consider himself under the deepest obligation to you, if you throw yourself into this task. I wish <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> would do the same, but that he Can at this time of day be induced to accept any terms is rather a matter for wishes than hopes. But when he has recovered from his agitation and alarm, I shall begin to have some hope that your influence with him may prove to be of the greatest avail. In having expressed a wish that my friend the consul <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> should remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> you have obliged <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and, believe me, myself also in the highest degree. For I value him so greatly, that he holds as high a place in my regard as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself: and if he had only allowed me to talk with him as usual, and had not again and again showed himself wholly averse from conversation with me, I should have been less unhappy than I am. For you must not suppose that anyone at this crisis is more painfully affected than I am by seeing a man, whom I love more than myself, resolved in his consulship to be anything in the world rather than a consul. If he will only deign to take your advice and to believe us in regard to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and to serve the rest of his consulship at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I shall even begin to hope that by the advice of the senate — acting at your suggestion, and with him to bring the matter formally before it — <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> may be reconciled. If that is done, I shall think that I have not lived in vain. I feel sure that you will entirely approve of what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> did about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>. Considering the circumstances, nothing better could have occurred than a settlement being made without a drop of blood. I am much gratified by the pleasure you express at the visit of my dear (and your dear) <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. Whatever <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> has told you about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and whatever <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has written, I am sure the latter will convince you by his acts — whatever measure of success he may have — that he has written with the most absolute sincerity. </p>                        </div>

I shall be glad to follow your advice, and all the more so, that I had spontaneously resolved to display the greatest clemency and to do my best to reconcile <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Let us try in this way if we can recover the affections of all parties, and enjoy a lasting victory; for others, owing to their cruelty, have been unable to avoid rousing hatred, or to maintain their victory for any length of time, with the one exception of Lucius <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, whom I have no intention of imitating. Let this be our new method of conquering-to fortify ourselves by mercy and generosity. As to how that may be secured, certain ideas suggest themselves to my mind, and many more may be hit upon. I beg you to take these matters into consideration. I have taken <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s prefect <a href=/people/3218 target=_blank>Numerius</a> <a href=/people/2111 target=_blank>Magius</a>. Of course I kept to my policy, and caused him at once to be set at liberty. I have now had two of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s prefects of engineers in my hands, and have set them both at liberty. If they wish to be grateful, they will be bound to advise <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to prefer my friendship to that of the men who have ever been most bitterly hostile both to him and myself, by whose intrigues the Republic has been reduced to its present position. </p>                        </div>

We are hanging entirely on news from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. If <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has caught our friend Gnaeus, there is a dubious hope of peace; but if the latter has got across beforehand, there is a fear of a fatal war. But do you see upon what sort of man the Republic has fallen? How clear-sighted, how alert, how well prepared! By heaven, if he puts no one to death, nor despoils anyone of anything, he will be most adored by those who had feared him most. The burgesses of the country towns, and the country people also, talk a great deal to me. They don't care a farthing for anything but their lands, their poor villas, their paltry pence. And now observe the reaction: the man in whom they once trusted they now dread: the man they dreaded they worship. What grave mistakes and vices on our side are accountable for this I cannot think of without sorrow.

VIII, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 2 MARCH: I feel sure that my daily packets must bore you, especially as I don't inform you of anything new, nor, in fact, am able to hit upon any novel sentiment to express. But if I went out of my way needlessly to send letter-carriers to you with these empty epistles, I should indeed be foolish: as it is, when people are going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, especially people about the house, I cannot reconcile myself to sending nothing by way of a letter to you; and besides, believe me, I find a relief in a time of such unhappiness in, as it were, talking to you; and much more so when I read letters from you. I certainly feel it to be true that there has been no period since our panic flight that less demanded a continuance of our correspondence, because no news reaches either <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or this place, which is only two or three days journey from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>: whereas <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> is the cardinal point of the whole struggle in this first campaign. I am therefore racked with suspense about it. But we shall know all before the 15th. For I observe that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a> on the afternoon of the same day — that is, the 21st of February — as that on the morning of which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a>. But <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> moves so rapidly, and encourages the speed of his men with such bounties, that I fear he may have approached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> quicker than may be convenient. You will say, What good, then, do you do by anticipating an annoyance, which you are to ascertain three days hence? None indeed. But, as I said before, I like above all things talking to you, and at the same time I want to tell you that my plan of procedure, which I thought quite fixed, is somewhat shaken. The precedents, of which you approve, don't altogether satisfy me. For what gallant action on their part in the service of the state has there ever been? Or who expects anything praiseworthy from them? Nor, by heaven, do I see anything commendable in those who have crossed the sea to prepare a war, intolerable as things were here-for I foresee the extent and destructive nature of that war. But there is one man who shakes my resolution, whose companion in flight, whose partner in the recovery of the constitution, I think myself bound to be. Do you change your opinion as often as that, then? I speak to you as to myself: and who is there that in a matter of such importance does not; argue with himself in a variety of ways? At the same time I also desire to elicit your opinion: if it is the same, that I may be strengthened in my resolution; if it has changed, that I may conform mine to yours. Certainly, in regard to my present doubt, it concerns me to know what <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and our friend <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> intend doing. As to <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, we hear contradictory rumours: at one time that he is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> not by any means leaping for joy, at another that he, with the <a href=/people/7869 target=_blank>Lepidi</a> has come to the walls of the city, which also I find not to be true. For <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> says that he has made his way somewhere by secret roads — is it to hide himself or to reach the sea? <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> himself does not know. He knows nothing either about the younger <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>. He adds a very annoying particular; that a considerable sum of money which <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> had at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a> had not been restored to him.

VIII, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 3 MARCH: On the 3rd of March <a href=/people/7627 target=_blank>Egypta</a> delivered me your letters, one, an old one, dated 26th of February, which you say that you intrusted to <a href=/people/1900 target=_blank>Pinarius</a>, whom I have not seen. In this you say that you are waiting to learn how <a href=/people/2268 target=_blank>Vibullius</a>, who had been sent in advance, is getting on, who did not obtain an interview with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> at all (I observe in your second letter that you are aware of this), and how I mean to receive <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> when he returns. I design to avoid meeting him at all. You mention also your intended retreat from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the change in your way of life, in the necessity of which I agree, and you say that you don't know whether <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> retains his fasces. When you know, please inform me. So much for your first letter. There followed two, both dated the 28th of February, which completely dislodged me from my old resolve, which, however, I told you was beginning to totter. I am not shaken by your expression, incensed with <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jove</a> himself, for there is danger in the angry passions of both; and though victory, of course, is uncertain, yet now the worse side seems to me to be the better prepared. Nor am I influenced by the consuls, who are themselves more easily moved than feather or leaf. Consideration of duty tortures me, and has all this while been torturing me, with indecision. To remain is certainly the more cautious policy, to cross the sea is considered the more honourable. Sometimes I prefer that many should think that I have acted incautiously, rather than a few think that I had acted dishonourably. You ask me about <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> and <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a>; they, indeed, have made up their minds to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and to come into the senate. Your most recent letter is dated on the 1st of March, in which you express a wish that there might be a meeting between them, and say that you do not despair of peace. But at the moment of writing I am of opinion that they will not meet, and that, if they do, <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> will not yield to any offer of terms. You appear to have no doubt, if the consuls cross, what I ought to do. They are certainly going to cross, or rather, as a matter of fact, have already crossed. But remember that, with the exception of <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, there is hardly one who has not a legal right to cross. For they either have imperium, as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, Sufenas, <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>, <a href=/people/3486 target=_blank>Voconius</a>, <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, the consuls themselves — who have by immemorial custom the right to visit all provinces or they are their legates. But I decide on nothing. As to what your opinion is, and pretty well what is the right course, I am clear. I would have written at greater length, if I had been able to do so with my own hand. But I think I shall be able to do so in a couple of days. I am sending you a copy of <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s letter received on the same day as yours, that you may sympathize with me, when you see me treated with such mockery. </p>                        </div>

For I cannot venture upon this (Lower) Sea at this season of the year. But by what route am I to get to the place, on which my thoughts are set, and to which the circumstances of the case call me? I must not delay my departure, lest anything should hinder it and tie me here. It is not, in truth, that man who attracts me, as is thought to be the case: I long ago knew him to be the most incapable of politicians, I now know him also to be the least capable of generals. It is not he, therefore, that attracts me, but it is the common talk reported to me by <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>. He says I am being torn to pieces by the Optimates. Ye Gods! Optimates indeed! See how they are rushing to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and parading their loyalty to him! Why, the country towns are offering him prayers as though he were a god, and not sham ones, as those offered on behalf of the other when he was ill. But the simple fact is that whatever mischief this <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Pisistratus</a> abstains from doing is as much a subject for gratitude, as if he had prevented some one else from doing it. They hope the one will be lenient, they believe the other to be enraged. What complimentary processions from the towns! What honours voted! Pure fright, you will say. Yes, I daresay; but they are still more afraid of the other. The artful clemency of the one delights, the angry temper of the other alarms, them. Those on the roll of the 360 jurors, who used to be particularly fond of our friend Gnaeus, and one or other of whom I see every day, are horrified at some of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415153ULuc class=demonym long=15.345 lat=41.5082>Lucerian</a> doings. So I want to know what sort of Optimates these are to force me abroad, while they remain at home themselves. However, be they who they may, I fear the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=ethnic long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojans</a>.

But why do I say some news? It is news of his shameful flight thence that I expect, and of the route which the victor is taking on his return and of his destination.

IX, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 6 MARCH: Although by the time you read this I think I shall know what has happened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> — for Gnaeus left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> on the 21st of February, and I write on the 6th of March, the fourteenth day after his removing from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412161UCan class=place long=16.0651 lat=41.2205>Canusium</a> — yet I am kept in painful suspense as to what each hour may bring, and am wondering that nothing even by way of rumour has reached me. There is a surprising silence. But perhaps all this is mere idle curiosity about what, after all, must soon be known. One thing worries me, that I cannot at present make out where our friend P. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> are. Now I want to know, in order the easier to find out their intentions, whether they are going to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and if so, by what route and when. The city, indeed, I am told, is now crammed full of Optimates. I hear that <a href=/people/1852 target=_blank>Sosius</a> and Lupus are sitting in court, whom our friend Gnaeus thought would arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> before himself. From these parts there is a general exodus. Even <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, with whom I am used to spend the day, is thinking of starting tomorrow. For myself, I am stopping on at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> in order to get quicker intelligence. Then I am for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. Thence, by whatever road there is least chance of meetings, to the Upper Sea, leaving behind or altogether giving up my lictors. For I am told that by some loyalists, who are now and have often been before a protection to the commonwealth, my staying in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> is disapproved, and that at their entertainments (beginning pretty early in the day too) many severe reflexions are being made upon me! Evidently, then, the thing to do is to leave the country, to wage war on <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> by land and sea, to rouse the hatred of the disloyal against us once more, which had become extinct, and to follow the advice of a <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> and <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a>! For others have some reason for going: <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, for instance, starts for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a>, the province allotted to him, or is accompanying his son-in-law, in either case with an honourable pretext, or, if you like, is avoiding the wrath of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. The <a href=/people/2425 target=_blank>Marcelli</a>, for their part, had they not feared the sword of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, would have remained: <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a> has the same reason for fear, and that, too, in connexion with a recent quarrel. Except him and Q. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, the rest are legates, <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a> is a proquaestor: I am the only one who might take either one course or the other. Added to this, there is my brother, whom it is not fair to involve in this adventure, considering that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would be still more angry with him. But I cannot induce him to stay behind. This concession I shall make to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, as in duty bound: for as far as I am concerned no one else influences me — nor the talk of the loyalists, who do not really exist, nor the cause which has been Conducted with timidity and will be conducted with crime. To one man, one alone, I make this concession, and that, too, without any request from him, and though — as he says — he is not defending his own cause, but that of the state.

I, however, had been told that he had gone either to join <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> or into Spain. What the truth of the matter is I should like very much to know: for it affects the question on which I am now deliberating, that, if <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, at any rate, has failed to find an exit from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, Gnaeus should understand that my own departure from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> is not easy, occupied as it now is throughout with arms and garrisons, especially in the winter season. For if it had been a more convenient season of the year, I might have sailed even on the Lower Sea. As it is, a passage is impossible except by the Upper Sea, to which my road is closed. Be good enough to inquire, therefore, about both <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>. No rumour has come as yet from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and today is the 9th, on which (or on the day before) I imagine that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>.

I said I didn't think <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would have crews: <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> felt confident on that point, and all the more, because <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s liberality had been heard of by shipowners.

IX, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 10 MARCH: ON your birthday you wrote me a letter full of advice, and not only showing the greatest kindness to me, but also the most admirable wisdom. <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> delivered it to me the day after receiving it from you. The points you put are indeed of extreme difficulty — the journey to the Upper Sea, a voyage by the Lower, a departure to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, lest I should seem to have avoided <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, a continuance at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>, lest I should seem to have put myself forward to congratulate him — but nothing is more distressing than the sight of those things, which, I tell you, must before long be seen. <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> has been with me: I told you how oppressive he was. Q. <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> also has been to see me. What a triumphant look! What assurance! Post haste for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>: denouncing the crime of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, the recklessness and folly of the senate. If I can't stand such things in my own villa, shall I be able to put up with <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>? But suppose me to endure this with good temper, what will be the sequel of the usual Speak, Marcus <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>? To say nothing of the Republican cause, which I look upon as lost, both from the wounds inflicted on it and the cures prepared for them, what am I to do about <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>? With whom — for why should I deny it?-I am downright angry. For I am always more affected by the causes of events than by the events themselves. Therefore, turning over these disastrous events in my mind — and what could be more disastrous!-or rather, coming to the conclusion that they are his doing and his fault, I feel more hostile to him than to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself: just as our ancestors decided that the day of the battle of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125WAli class=place long=12.5207 lat=42.0177>Allia</a> was more fatal than that of the capture of the city, because the latter evil was the result of the former; and accordingly the one day is even now regarded as accursed, while the other is generally unknown — so I, remembering the errors of ten years, among which was also that year which ruined me, without his defending me (not to put it more strongly), and being fully aware of the rashness, incompetence, and carelessness of the present management, felt my anger growing. But that is all forgotten now. It is of his kindness that I think, and also of my own position. I understand-later, indeed, than I could have wished, thanks to the letters and conversations of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> — I see plainly, I repeat, that the one object now, nay, the one object from the beginning, was the death of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. As for me, therefore, since <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>'s hero, when his goddess mother said to him, For next to <a href=/people/40 target=_blank>Hector</a>'s death thy doom is fixed, answered his mother: <a href=/people/257 target=_blank>Death</a>, then! since fate allowed me not to save The friend I loved. What should I do for one who was not merely a friend, but a benefactor also? One, too, of such a great character, and engaged in such a great cause? Why, in truth, I regard such duties as worth the loss of life. In your Optimates, however, I have no sort of confidence, and henceforth do not devote myself either to their service. I see how they are surrendering themselves to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and will continue to do so in the future. Do you suppose that those decrees of the municipalities as to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s illness are to be compared with these congratulations now offered to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on his victory? All terror, you will say. Yes, but they themselves assert that they were alarmed on the former occasion. However, let us wait to see what has happened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, Perhaps from that may come a change of plan and in the tone of my letters. </p>                        </div>

He says, too, that the six cohorts which were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=place long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alba</a> had joined <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> by the Minucian road: that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had written to tell him that, and he would himself be shortly at the city. Therefore I shall follow your advice, and shall not go into hiding at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> at the present time, although, as I wished to give my son his toga virilis at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, I contemplated leaving this excuse for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. But perhaps that very thing would offend him — Why not at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> rather? And after all, if meet him I must, I would rather it were here than anywhere. Then I shall consider the rest, that is, whither and by what road and when I am to go. <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, I hear, is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424113UCos class=place long=11.2877 lat=42.4126>Cosa</a>, ready, too, I am told, to set sail: if to Spain I don't approve, if to join Gnaeus I commend him: he had better go anywhere than have to see <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a>, of whom, though his patron, I cannot stand the sight. What, then, am I to say of the rest? But, I suppose, we had better keep quiet, lest we prove our own error, who, while loving the city, that is, our country, and while thinking that the matter would be patched up, have so managed matters as to be completely intercepted and made prisoners. I had written thus far when a letter arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=person long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, as follows: Pompey has crossed the sea with all the men he had with him. The total is 30,000; besides the consuls, two tribunes of the plebs, and the senators who were with him, all with wives and children. He is said to have embarked on the 4th of March. Since that day the north wind has prevailed. They say that he disabled or burnt all such ships as he did not use. On this subject a letter has been received at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> by L. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, the tribune, from his mother-in-law <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>, who has herself crossed. I was anxious and full of pain before, as, of course, the bare facts of the case compelled, when I found myself unable to unravel the mystery by any consideration; but now, when <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and the consuls have left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I am not merely pained, I am burning with indignation: Reason deserts her throne, And I am torn with grief. Believe me, I really am beside myself to think of the dishonour I have brought upon myself. That I, in the first place, should not be with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, whatever plan he has followed, nor, in the second place, with the loyalists, however imprudently managed their cause! Especially, too, when those very persons, for whose sake I was somewhat timid in trusting myself to fortune-wife, daughter, son, and nephew-prefered that I should follow that design, and thought that my present plan was discreditable and unworthy of me. For, as to my brother Quintus, whatever I determined upon he said that he considered right, and he accepted it with the most absolute acquiescence. I am reading over your letters from the beginning of the business. They somewhat relieve me. The earliest ones warn and entreat me not to be precipitate. The next indicate that you are glad that I stayed. Whilst reading them I feel less base, but only while I read them. Presently grief and the vision of shame rises again. Wherefore, my dear Titus, pray pluck out this sorrow from my mind, or at least mitigate it by consoling words or advice, or by anything you can. But what could you or any human being do? It is now almost beyond the power of God. For my part, my object now, as you advise and think possible, is to obtain leave from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> to absent myself when any motion is being made against <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> in the senate. But I fear I may not obtain the concession. <a href=/people/1111 target=_blank>Furnius</a> has arrived from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. To show you the sort of men we are following, he tells me that the son of Q. <a href=/people/1599 target=_blank>Titinius</a> is with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but that the latter thanks me even more than I could wish. What, however, it is that he asks of me, expressed indeed, for his part, in few words, but still en grand seigneur, you may learn from his own letter. How distressed I am at your ill-health: if we had only been together, you would at least not have wanted advice. For two heads, you know. But don't let us cry over spilt milk: let us do better for the future. Up to this time I have been mistaken in two particulars: at the beginning I hoped for peace, and, if that were once gained, was prepared to be content with the life of a private citizen, and an old age freed from anxiety: and later, I found that a bloody and destructive war was being undertaken by <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Upon my honour, I thought it showed a better man and a better citizen to suffer any punishment whatever rather than, I don't say to lead, but even to take part in such bloody work. I think it would have been better even to die than to be with such men. I shall bear any result with greater courage than such a pain. </p>                        </div>

IX, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE 12 MARCH: Although any feeling of repose is for me confined to the time I spend in writing to you or reading a letter from you, yet I am myself at a loss for a subject for my letters, and I feel certain that the same is the case with you. For the topics usually filling familiar letters, written with an easy mind, are excluded by the critical nature of these times; while those connected with the crisis we have already worn threadbare. Nevertheless, not to surrender myself wholly to sorrowful reflexions, I have selected certain theses, so to speak, which have at once a general bearing on a citizen's duty, and a particular relation to the present crisis: Ought one to remain in one's country when under a tyrant? If one's country is under a tyrant ought one to labour at all hazards for the abolition of the tyranny, even at the risk of the total destruction of the city? Or ought we to be on our guard against the man attempting the abolition, lest he should rise too high himself? Ought one to assist one's country when under a tyrant by seizing opportunities and by argument rather than by war? Is it acting like a good citizen to quit one's country when under a tyrant for any other land, and there to remain quiet, or ought one to face any and every danger for liberty's sake? Ought one to wage war upon and besiege one's native town, if it is under a tyrant? Even if one does not approve an abolition of a tyranny by war, ought one still to enroll oneself in the ranks of the loyalists? Ought one in politics to share the dangers of one's benefactors and friends, even though one does not think their general policy to be wise? Should a man who has done conspicuous services to his country, and on that very account has been shamefully treated and exposed to envy, voluntarily place himself in danger for his country, or may he be permitted at length to take thought for himself and those nearest and dearest to him, giving up all political struggles against the stronger party?  By keeping myself at work on questions such as these, and discussing both sides both in Greek and Latin, I at once distract my mind for a time from its anxieties, and at the same time attempt the solution of a problem now very much to the point. But I fear you may find me unseasonable; for if the bearer of this keeps up the proper pace, it will reach you exactly on your ague day. </p>                        </div>

IX, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 13 MARCH: I wrote you a letter on the 12th of March, but the messenger to whom I intended to give it did not start on that day. But there did arrive that very day that swiftfoot mentioned by <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a>. He brought me your full and very interesting letter, which did, so to speak, put just a drop of life into me: for wholly restored I can't say that I am. But you have clearly done the main thing. Yes, believe me, a prosperous issue for me is not now my aim at all: for I see plainly that we can never have our constitution, either while these two men are both alive, or with this one remaining. Accordingly, I no longer entertain any hope of repose for myself, nor refuse to contemplate any amount of sorrow. The one thing I do positively dread is doing, or, I should say, having done anything dishonourable. So be assured that your letter was wholesome for me, and I don't only mean this longer one — the most explicit and complete possible — but also the shorter one, in which what gave me the most intense pleasure was the statement that my policy and action had the approval of Sextus. I am exceedingly obliged to you, of whose affection to myself and keen sense of what is right I am well aware. Your longer letter, indeed, relieved not only myself, but all my party from painful feelings. So I will follow your advice and remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>: I shall thus avoid the scandal of a meeting with him outside the city, or, if I see him neither here nor there, giving him the impression of his having been intentionally avoided by me. As to your advice to ask him to allow me to show the same consideration for <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, as I have shown to himself — that you will see from the letters of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, of which I sent you copies, I have been doing all the time. I send you also <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter to them, written in quite a sane frame of mind, considering the insanity of the whole business. If, on the other hand, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will not make this concession to me, I see your opinion is that my role should be that of the peacemaker. In this it is not the danger that I fear — for with so many hanging over my head, why not settle the matter by choosing the most honourable?-but what I do fear is embarrassing <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>; and that he should turn upon me The monster <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s petrifying glare. For our friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has set his heart to a surprising degree on imitating <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s reign. I am not speaking without book, I assure you. He never made less of a secret of anything. With such a man, you will say, do you wish to be associated? I follow personal obligation, not the cause: as I did in the case of <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>, and in — but there is no need to go into that. Is not the cause, then, a good one? Nay, the best: but it will be conducted, remember, in the most criminal way. The first plan is to choke off the city and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> by starving them; the next, to devastate the country with sword and fire, and not to keep their hands off the money of the wealthy. But seeing that I fear the same from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s side, without any good to be got on <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s, I think my better course is to stay at home, and there await whatever comes. Yet I hold myself to be under so great an obligation to him, that I do not venture to incur the charge of ingratitude. However, you have yourself fully stated what is to he said in defence of that course. As to the triumph, I quite agree with you: it will not cost me a moment's hesitation or a pang to throw it utterly aside. I much like your idea that, while I am moving about the country, the moment for sailing may suddenly present itself. If only, say you, Pompey shows a resolute front enough. He is even more resolute than I thought. You may pin your faith on him. I promise you that, if he wins, he will not leave a tile on any roof in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>! You his ally, then? Yes, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, against my own judgment, and against the warnings of all history; and — not so much to help his side, as to avoid seeing what is going on here — I am anxious to quit the country. For pray don't imagine that the mad proceedings of the party in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> will be endurable or all of one kind. I need hardly, however, point out to you, that when laws, jurors, law courts, and senate are abolished, neither the fortunes of individuals nor the revenues of the state will suffice for the licentious desires, the shameless demands, the extravagances, and the necessities of so many men in the lowest depths of poverty. Let me depart, therefore, never mind by what kind of voyage-that, indeed, shall be as you please — but anyhow let me depart. For I, at least, shall be able to satisfy your curiosity on one point, as to what has been done at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. I am very glad — if one can be glad of anything now — to hear that my conduct up to this has the approval of the loyalists, and that they are aware of my not having started. As to <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, I will make more careful inquiry: I have given orders about it to <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>, a man of courage and even too strong an Optimate. The last thing I have to say is this: supposing you are now at a loss for something to write about — for any other subject is out of the question, and what more can be found to say on this?-yet, as there is no lack of ability (I mean it, by Heaven!) or affection on your part, which latter also adds a spur to my own intellect, pray maintain your practice of writing all you possibly can. I am a little vexed at your not inviting me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>; I shouldn't give much trouble as a guest! But good-bye; for as you must have your walk and anointing, so I must have some sleep. In fact, your letter has made sleep possible for me. </p>                        </div>

You ask about L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>: not only Lucius, but <a href=/people/1616 target=_blank>Aulus</a> also, has left the country, the latter a good many days ago.

IX, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 17 MARCH: I RECEIVED three letters from you on the 16th of March. They were dated on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. So I will answer each in its order of time. I quite agree with you in thinking <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a> the best of all places for me to stay. I also agree with you about the Upper Sea, and I am very desirous, as I told you in a previous letter, to discover how I may without annoying <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> avoid taking any part whatever in the conduct of public affairs. You praise me for saying that I put away the memory of my friend's past and his shortcomings. I really do so: nay, I even forget those very injuries inflicted by him upon myself which you mention. So much more influence do I choose gratitude for kindness to have with me, than resentment for injury. Let me act, then, according to your opinion, and summon up all my energies. The fact is, I am philosophizing all the time I am riding about the country, and in the course of my expeditions I never cease meditating on my theses. But some of them are very difficult of solution. As to the Optiinates, be it as you will: but you know the proverb, <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379229PKor class=place long=22.8802 lat=37.9054>Corinth</a>. The son of <a href=/people/1599 target=_blank>Titinius</a> is with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. You seem to have a kind of fear that I do not like your counsels: the fact, however, is that nothing else gives me any pleasure except your advice and your letters. Pray, therefore, keep to your word: do not cease writing to me whatever occurs to you: you can do me no greater favour. I now come to your second. You are quite right to be incredulous about the number of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s men. <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a> just doubled them in her letter. It was all a lie also about disabling the ships. You praise the consuls: so do I as far as their spirit is concerned, but I blame their policy. For by their departure the negotiation for peace was rendered impossible, which I for one was meditating. Accordingly, after this I sent you back <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a>'s book On Concord, and gave it to <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>. Nor have I any doubt left of a murderous war impending, which will begin with a famine. And yet I am vexed that I am not taking part in such a war! A war in which wickedness is certain to attain such dimensions, that, whereas it is a crime not to support one's parents, our leaders will think themselves entitled to starve to death the supreme and holiest of parents-their country! And this fear is not with me a matter of conjecture: I have heard their actual words. The whole object of collecting this fleet from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=place long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchis</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/336354PSid class=place long=35.371 lat=33.56>Sidon</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/349359PAra class=place long=35.859 lat=34.856>Aradus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp class=place long=33 lat=35>Cyprus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam class=place long=32.01 lat=37.01>Pamphylia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc class=place long=29.5 lat=36.5>Lycia</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384261PChi class=place long=26.1342 lat=38.3764>Chios</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290UByz class=place long=28.9836 lat=41.0119>Byzantium</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/392261ILes class=place long=26.2 lat=39.2075>Lesbos</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384271PSmy class=place long=27.1383 lat=38.4191>Zmyrna</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375273PMil class=place long=27.2775 lat=37.5292>Miletus</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369273PKos class=place long=27.2859 lat=36.8914>Cos</a>, is to intercept the supplies of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> and blockade the corn-growing provinces. Then, again, in what a state of anger will <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> come! And especially with the very men most anxious for his safety, as though he had been abandoned by those whom he, in fact, abandoned himself. Accordingly, in my state of doubt as to what it is right for me to do, my feeling of obligation to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> becomes a very weighty motive: if that feeling were away, it were better in my eyes to perish in my country, than to ruin it in the attempt to save it. About the north wind it is clearly as you say: I am afraid <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> may be harassed. But what part of Greece do you suppose will not be plundered? For <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> gives out openly, and demonstrates to his soldiers, that he will outdo <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> even in his liberality. It is an excellent suggestion of yours that, when I do see <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, I should not speak with too much tolerance, but rather with a grave severity. I clearly ought to do so. I am thinking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, but not till I have had my meeting with him; thus avoiding being absent when he arrives, or having to hurry backwards and forwards along a detestably bad road. I am told, as you say in your letter, that <a href=/people/438 target=_blank>Bibulus</a> has arrived and started back again on the 14th. You were expecting <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>, you say in your third letter. But he only left me on the 15th. That was why you got my letter in reply to yours rather late, though I wrote the answer at once. I agree with what you say about <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> — he is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/424113UCos class=place long=11.2877 lat=42.4126>Cosa</a>, and no one knows what his design is. Yes, that basest, meanest fellow in the world, who says that a consular election can be held by a praetor, is the same as he always was in constitutional matters. So of course that was what <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> meant by saying in the letter, of which I sent you a copy, that he wished to avail himself of my advice, (well, well! that is a mere generality), of my popularity (that's empty flattery — but I suppose he adopts that tone with a view to my influencing certain senatorial votes), of my position (perhaps he means my vote as a consular). He finishes up by saying of my help in every particular. I had already begun to suspect from your letter that this was the real meaning of it, or something very like it. For it is of great importance to him that there should not be an interregnum: and that he secures, if the consuls are created by the praetor. However, it is on record in our augural books that, so far from consuls being legally capable of being created by a praetor, the praetors themselves cannot be so created, and that there is no precedent for it: that it is illegal in case of the consuls, because it is not legal for the greater imperium to be proposed to the people by the less; in case of the praetors, because their names are submitted to the people as colleagues of the consuls, to whom belongs the greater imperium. Before long he will be demanding that my vote in the college should be given, and he won't be content with <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, and <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>: Then let the wide earth gape and swallow me But you see what a storm is impending. Which of the senators have crossed the sea I will tell you when I know for certain. About the corn-supply you are quite right, it cannot possibly be managed without a revenue: and you have good reason for fearing the clamorous demands of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s entourage, and an unnatural war. I should much like to see my friend <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a>, though, as you say, he is in despair about everything. Pray urge him to make haste and come: for it will be a great convenience to see him before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arrival. As to the property at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, as soon as I heard of Phamea's death, I conceived the wish — provided the constitution was to survive — that some one of my friends should buy it, yet I never thought of you, the greatest of my friends. For I knew that you usually wanted to know how many years' purchase it was worth, and what was the value of the fixtures, and I had seen your digamma not only at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but also at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a>. After all, however, I value it, pretty as it is, at less price than it was valued in the consulship of <a href=/people/1706 target=_blank>Marcellinus</a>, when I thought-owing to the house I possessed at that time at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> — that those little pleasure-grounds would suit me better, and be less expensive, than repairing my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> house. I was then willing to give 500 sestertia for them. I made an offer through a third person, which he refused, when he was putting it up for sale at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>. But in these days I presume all such properties are gone down in value, owing to the dearness of money. It will suit me exactly, or rather us, if you buy it. But don't be put off by the late owner's follies: it is really a lovely place. However, all such properties appear to me to be now doomed to desolation. I have answered your three letters, but am expecting others. For up to this time it is letters from you that have kept me going.

IX, 10) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 18 MARCH: I have nothing to write about: for I have heard no news and I answered all your letters yesterday. But as uneasiness of mind not only deprives me of sleep, but prevents my even keeping awake without extreme pain, I have begun this letter to you — I can't tell what about, and I have no subject to hand — that I may in a manner have a talk with you, the one thing which gives me any repose. I think I have been a fool from the beginning, and the one thing that torments me is that I did not follow <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, like any private in the ranks, when, in every part of his policy, he was losing his footing, or rather rushing headlong to ruin. On the 17th of January I could see that he was thoroughly frightened. On that very day I detected his design. From that moment he forfeited my confidence, and never ceased committing one blunder after another. Meanwhile, never a line to me; no thought of anything but flight. Need I say more? As in love affairs men lose all fancy for women who are dirty, stupid, and indelicate, even so, the indecency of his flight and mismanagement put me off from my love for him. For in no respect was he acting in a way to make it proper for me to join his flight. Now love again rises: now my regret for him is more than I can bear: now I can get no good out of books, literature, or philosophy. So earnestly as I gaze across the sea, do I long, like <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s bird, to fly away. I am being punished, indeed I am, for my rashness. Yet what did that rashness amount to? What have I done without the most anxious consideration? If his only object had been flight, I could have fled with the utmost pleasure, but it was the nature of the war, beyond measure sanguinary and widespread, the future of which men do not yet realize, that I shrank from with horror. What threats to the towns, to individual loyalists personally, to everybody, in fact, who stayed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>! How often did I hear <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> could do it, why not I? For myself I was haunted with the reflexions: it was unrighteous of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> to stir up <a href=/people/3670 target=_blank>Porsena</a> and <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a> <a href=/people/2327 target=_blank>Mamilius</a> against his country; impious in <a href=/people/2734 target=_blank>Coriolanus</a> to seek aid from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416133RVol class=ethnic long=13.3 lat=41.6>Volsci</a>; righteous in <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> to prefer death; <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>, son of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Pisistratus</a>, who fell in the battle of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381240DMar class=place long=23.9701 lat=38.1466>Marathon</a> bearing arms against his country, was criminal. But it may be said that <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, and <a href=/people/391 target=_blank>Cinna</a> had right on their side: rather I should perhaps admit that they had a technical justification; yet what could be more cruel and bloody than their use of victory? It was the nature of the war that I shrank from, and the more so because I saw that even bloodier work was being imagined and prepared. I — whom some called the preserver of this city, some its parent — I to bring against it armies of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435268RGet class=ethnic long=26.8 lat=43.5>Getae</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm class=ethnic long=44.298 lat=39.702>Armenians</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>! I to inflict famine on my fellow citizens, devastation upon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>! <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, to begin with, I reflected was mortal, and in the next place might also come to an end in many ways: but the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a> and our people I thought ought to be preserved, as far as in us lay, for ever: and, after all, I pleased myself by hoping that some accommodation would be reached rather than the one of these men commit such a crime, or the other such an abomination. The matter is now wholly changed, and so are my feelings. The sun, as you said in one of your letters, seems to me to have disappeared from the universe. As in the case of a sick man one says, While there is life there is hope, so, as long as <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I did not cease to hope. It is the present situation, the present, I say, that has baffled my calculations. And to confess the truth, my age, now after my long day's labour sloping towards an evening of repose, has relaxed my energies by suggesting the charms of family life. But now, however dangerous the experiment of attempting to fly hence, that experiment shall at least be made. I ought, perhaps, to have done so before. But the considerations I have mentioned held me back, and above all things your influence. For when I got to this point in my letter, I unrolled the volume of your letters, which I keep under seal and preserve with the greatest care. Now there were in the letter dated by you the 21st of January the following expression: But let us first see what Gnaeus is about, and in what direction his plans are drifting. Now, if he does abandon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, he will be acting certainly improperly, and, in my opinion, unwisely too. But it will be time enough, when he does that, to make a change in our policy. This you write on the fourth day after our quitting the city Next on the 23rd of January: May our friend Gnaeus only not abandon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, as he has unwisely done <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> ! On the same day you write a second letter, in which you answer my application for advice in the plainest terms. This is what you say: To come to the point on which you ask my opinion If Gnaeus quits <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I think you should return to the city: for what limit can there be to such a trip abroad as that? This is what I could not get over: and I now see that attached to a most humiliating flight, which you euphemistically call a trip abroad, is an unlimited war. Then follows your prophecy of the 25th of January: If <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> remains in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, and no terms are come to, I think there will be an unusually long war: but if he abandons <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I think that there awaits us in the future a really 'truceless' war. It is in such a war, then, that I am forced to be an abettor-one that is both truceless and with fellow citizens. Again, on the 7th of February, when you had heard more particulars of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s designs, you end a certain letter thus; For my part, if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> quits <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I should not advise your doing the same. For you will be running a very great risk and be doing no good to the Republic, to which you may be of some service hereafter if you remain. What patriot or statesman would not such advice, backed by the weight of wisdom and friendship, have moved? Next, on the 11th of February, you again answer my request for advice thus: You ask me whether I advise flight, or defend delay, and consider it the better course: for the present, indeed, my opinion is that a sudden departure and hurried start would be, both for yourself and Gnaeus useless and dangerous, and I think it better that you should be separate and each on his own watchtower. But, on my honour, I think it disgraceful for us to be thinking of flight! This disgraceful measure our friend Gnaeus had contemplated two years ago: for so long a time past has his mind been set on playing the <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> and indulging in proscriptions. Then, as I think, after you had written to me again in somewhat more general terms, and I had taken certain expressions of yours as advising me to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, you warmly disavow any such meaning on the 19th of February. I certainly have not indicated in any letter of mine that, if Gnaeus quits <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, you should do so with him: or, if I did so express myself, I was, I don't say inconsistent, but mad. In another passage of the same letter you say: Nothing is left for him but flight, in which I do not think, and never have thought, that you, should share. This whole question again you discuss in greater detail in a letter of the 22nd of February: If M. <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> and L. <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a> stay, I think you should stay also: with the understanding, however, that, if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> survives and makes a stand anywhere, you should leave this inferno, and be more content to be beaten in the contest along with him, than reign with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in the sink of iniquity which will evidently prevail here. You adduce many arguments to support this opinion. Then at the end you say: What if <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> and <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a> depart? In that case I doubt. So I think you must acquiesce in whatever happens and whatever you have done. If you had felt doubt before, you have now, at any rate, no hesitation, since those two are still in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Again, when the flight had become an accomplished fact, on the 25th of February: Meanwhile, I feel no doubt you had better remain at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>. That will be the most suitable place for waiting to see what turns up. On the 1st of March, when <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had been four days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>: We shall be able to deliberate then no longer, it is true, with quite free hands, but certainly less fatally committed than if you had taken the great plunge in his company. Then on the 4th of March, though writing briefly, because it was the eve of your attack of ague, you yet use this expression: I will write at greater length tomorrow; however, speaking generally, I will say this — that I do not repent my advice as to your staying, and though with great anxiety, yet, because I think it involves less evil than your starting would do, I abide by my opinion and rejoice that you have stayed. Moreover, when I was now in great pain, and was fearing that I had been guilty of a base act, on the 5th of March you say: After all, I am not sorry that you are not with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Hereafter, if it turns out to be necessary, there will be no difficulty: and at whatever time it takes place, it will be welcome to him. But I speak on the understanding that, if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> goes on as he has begun, and acts with sincerity, moderation, and wisdom, I shall have thoroughly to reconsider the position, and to look with greater care into what is for our advantage to do. On the 9th of March you say that our friend <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a> also approves of my having kept quiet; and his opinion has great weight with me. From these expressions in your letters I console myself with the belief that as yet I have done no wrong. Only pray justify your advice. There is no need to do so as far as I am concerned, but I want others to be in the same boat as myself. If I have done nothing wrong in the past, I will maintain the same blamelessness in the future. Only pray continue your exhortation that direction, and assist me by communicating your thoughts. Nothing has as yet been heard here about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s return. For myself, I have got thus much good by writing this letter: I have read through all yours, and have found repose in that. </p>                        </div>

IX, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE 20 MARCH: Do you know that our friend <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>? Having been told this by a passer-by, who said that he had recognized him on the <a href=/people/2715 target=_blank>Appia</a> upon his partly drawing the curtain of his sedan, though it was in itself probable, I yet sent some servants to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> to inquire and take him a letter. He was discovered with some difficulty, as he was keeping himself concealed in his villa, and he sent me back an answer containing wonderful expressions of gratitude to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; but as to his own plans he said that he had given C. <a href=/people/9053 target=_blank>Caecius</a> a message for me. I am expecting him today, that is, the 20th of March. <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> also came to see me on the <a href=/people/4285 target=_blank>Quinquatrus</a> (19th of March), a man, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, as he seemed to me, of moderate and sensible views. Certainly he has always been regarded as a promoter of peace. How strongly he appealed to me to disapprove what, is going on in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>! How fearful of that inferno, as you call it! In the course of a long conversation I showed him <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter to me, the one of which I have sent you a copy before, and asked him to explain the sentence in it — he wished to avail himself of my advice, influence, position, and help in all ways. He replied that he had no doubt that he wanted my help and my influence for effecting a pacification. I only wish I could effect and carry through some politic move in the present distressing circumstances of the state! For his part, <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> felt confident that that was <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s feeling, and promised that he would promote it. However, on the day previous <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a> had been with me, who said that he had quitted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 6th of March and had left <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> there: and the same news was brought also by those who quitted that place on the 8th. They one and all, even <a href=/people/2511 target=_blank>Crassipes</a> — who is a sensible enough man to take note of what was going on — tell the same story of threatening speeches, alienation from the Optimates, hostility to the municipal towns, undisguised proscriptions — Sullas pure and simple. What things <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a> says, and the whole posse of Greeks, and <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> at their head! And yet there is no hope of safety except in them: and I am keeping my mind on the watch, and passing sleepless nights, and yearning to be with men exactly the opposite of myself, in order to escape the abominations going on here! For there — what crime do you suppose <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, <a href=/people/1629 target=_blank>Faustus</a>, <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> will stick at, whose creditors are said to be actually arranging to sell them up? What do you suppose they are likely to do to the citizens, if they turn out the winning side? Moreover, what a poltroon our Gnaeus is! They tell me he is thinking of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=place long=40 lat=28>Arabia</a> <a href=/people/652 target=_blank>Felix</a>, and <a href=/people/290 target=_blank>Mesopotamia</a>, and has now quite abandoned Spain. The reports are outrageous, but they may possibly be untrue: yet at best all is lost here, and far from safe there. I am beginning to pine for a letter from you. Since our flight there has never been so long a break in them. I send you a copy of my letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, by which I think I shall do some good. </p>                        </div>

IX, 12) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 20 MARCH: I HAD just read your letter on the 20th, when a packet was brought me from Lepta saying that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had been completely invested, that even the channels of the harbour were blocked up with vessels. Upon my honour, tears prevent my thinking of or writing the rest. I send you a copy. What wretches we have been! Why did we not follow his fortunes to the end? Oh, here's the same news from <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> and <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a>, who have been met by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter-bearers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138UMin class=place long=13.7684 lat=41.242>Minturnae</a>. I feel so wracked with misery that I long for an end like that of <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a>. Yet how honourable, how clear is your advice, how thoroughly thought out, in regard to my journey by land as well as by sea, and my meeting and conversation with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>! There is honour and caution alike in every word. Your invitation to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, too, how kindly, how courteous, how brotherly it is! I am surprised at <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a>, who has been treated with greater honour in my family than <a href=/people/959 target=_blank>Panaetius</a> was in <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s: yet my unfortunate position has been regarded by him with the foulest contempt. I detest the fellow, and always shall. I only wish I could be even with him! But his own character will be his punishment. Yes, pray, now of all times turn over in your mind what I ought to do. An army of the Roman people is actually surrounding Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>: it has inclosed him with foss and palisade; it is preventing his escape. Are we alive? Is our city still intact? Are the praetors presiding in the courts, the aediles making preparations for their games, the Optimates entering their investments, I myself sitting quietly looking on? Am I to make an effort to reach <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> like a madman? Am I to appeal to the loyalty of the municipal towns? The loyalists won't follow me, the careless will laugh me to scorn, the revolutionists — especially now that they are successful and fully armed — will use main force to me. What is your opinion, then? Have you any advice to give as to how to put an end to this most wretched state of existence? It is now that I feel the pang, the torture — now that some one is found to think me either wise or lucky for not having gone. My feeling is the reverse. For while I was never willing to be the partner of his victory, I should have preferred having been associated with his disaster. Why, then, should I now appeal to your letter, to your wisdom, or your kindness? It is all over. Nothing can help me now: for I have now nothing even to wish for, except to be set free by some merciful stroke of the enemy. </p>                        </div>

IX, 13) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 23 MARCH: 'Tis no true tale  — as I think — that about the ships. For in that case what would have been the meaning of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s words in his letter, dated from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 13th of March, when he mentioned it as a success on the part of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was in full retreat, and was going to sail with the first favourable wind? This is quite inconsistent with those letters, of which I have already sent you copies. Here, indeed, they talk of nothing but disaster. But we have no more recent authority, and of this particular fact no better one, than <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>. I have received your letter of the 22nd of March, in which you propose to postpone all plans till we know what has happened. Of course that is quite right: and meanwhile it is impossible not merely to settle but even to consider any plan. However, this letter of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s inclines me to recur to my original ideas. For on the day before the <a href=/people/4285 target=_blank>Quinquatrus</a> (18th of March) the weather was splendid, and I suppose he has taken advantage of it. That precis of your advice was not made by me by way of reproach to you, but rather to console myself. For the evils of the time were not causing me so much vexation, as the idea of my having done wrong and acted rashly. I have now got rid of that idea, since my actions and plans coincide with your suggestions. You remark in your letter that it is rather my avowal of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s services, than the actual amount of them, that makes me seem to be under an obligation to him. That is true: I have always magnified them, and the more so that I might prevent his thinking that I remembered his earlier conduct. However much I might remember this, I should yet be bound to follow the example he set at that time. He gave me no aid when he might have done so. True: but afterwards he was my friend, and a very warm one, I don't at all know why. Therefore I too will be his friend. Nay, more, there is this analogy in our two cases, that we have been betrayed by the same people. But oh, that it had been in my power to render him as important a service, as he was able to render me! After all, I am exceedingly grateful for what he did; yet, at the present moment, I neither know how to help him, nor, if I could, should I think I ought to assist him while preparing to engage on such an execrable war. Only I don't wish to hurt his feelings by remaining here. I should neither have the resolution, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! to watch the events, which you can even now foresee in imagination, nor to take part in those unhappy measures. But I was all the slower to depart, from the difficulty of imagining a voluntary departure when there is no hope of a return. For I see that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is so well equipped with infantry, cavalry, fleets, and Gallic auxiliaries. About these last I suppose <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> was talking big, but he certainly said that 10,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry promised their services at their own expense for ten years. But grant this to be gasconnade. He certainly has great forces, and he will not merely have the revenue of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, but the property of the citizens. Add to this the man's own self-confidence and the weakness of the loyalists, who, in fact, because they think <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> deservedly enraged with them, have, as you expressed it, become disgusted with the game. Yes, but I could have wished that you had indicated who these men were. The fact is that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, because he has done much less than he threatened, is regarded with affection; while in every direction those who loved <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> now cease to do so. The municipal towns, in fact, and the Romans living in the country fear <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and are still attached to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Accordingly, the latter is so well prepared that, even if he proves unable to win a victory, I yet cannot see how he can be beaten himself. For myself, I am not so much afraid of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s sorcery, as of his power of compulsion. For the requests of tyrants, as <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> says,you know, partake of the nature of commands. I see you don't like a place of residence for me without a port. Neither do I: but the fact is I have there both a means of concealment and a trusty band of followers. If I could have had the same at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, I should have preferred it. But concealment is impossible there. However, as you say, when we know! I am not very careful to excuse myself to, the loyalists. For what dinners they are giving and attending, according to Sextus's letter to me! How splendid, how early! But let them be as loyalist as they please, they are not more so than we are. I should have cared more for their opinion, if they had shown more courage. I was wrong about Phamea's estate at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>. I was dreaming of one near Troja. I wanted it for Quintus; but it is too dear. I should, however, have liked to buy that one, if I had seen any prospect of enjoying it. What, frightful news we are reading every day you will understand from the small roll inclosed in this packet. Our friend <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>, distracted with doubt, he too, as <a href=/people/9053 target=_blank>Caecius</a> tells me, as to what to do. He is in terror of a contretemps like that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421138UCor class=place long=13.8422 lat=42.1238>Corfinium</a>. He thinks that he had done his duty to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and is affected by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s magnanimous treatment, but still more, after all, by the outlook in the future. </p>                        </div>

Lo and behold, on the same day I receive a letter from Q. <a href=/people/12083 target=_blank>Pedius</a>, from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, telling me that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had written to him on the 14th of March in the following words: Pompey keeps himself in the town. Our camp is at the gates. We are attempting a difficult operation, and one which will occupy many days, owing to the depth of the sea; but nevertheless it is the best thing for us to do. We are throwing out moles from both headlands at the mouth of the harbour, in order to compel <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> to take the forces he has at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> across as soon as possible, or to prevent his getting out at all. Where is the peace, as to which <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> said that he was in a state of anxiety? Could there be anything more vindictive, more ruthless? Moreover, a certain person told me on good authority that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> gives out that he is avenging Cn. <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a>, M. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, and all those on whom <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s assistance, had wreaked his cruelty; that <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> was doing nothing under his leadership which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had not done under <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s; that he was seeking the restoration of those whose exile had not been inflicted upon them by earlier laws, while <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> had restored men who had been traitors to their country; that he complained of the violence used to secure <a href=/people/351 target=_blank>Milo</a>'s exile, but that, nevertheless, he would harm no one unless he appeared in array against him. This is the story told by a certain <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a>, who left <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> on the 13th, a man who is not without some sense, but yet not capable of inventing this out of his own head. I am quite at a loss what to do. From <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, indeed, I suppose <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has already started. Whatever has happened, we shall know in two days. I haven't a line from you, not even by <a href=/people/3121 target=_blank>Anteros</a>. No wonder: for what is there for us to write about? Nevertheless, I don't omit a single day. P.S — After this letter was written, I got a letter from Lepta before daybreak dated from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 15th of March. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> has embarked from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, but <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 26th of March. </p>                        </div>

IX, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 25 MARCH: AFTER I had despatched the letter informing you that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 26th, I received one from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> saying that he would be in <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127UAlb class=demonym long=12.6504 lat=41.7464>Alban</a> villa on the 28th. When I have seen him I shall go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. If he grants me the indulgence I ask for, I shall avail myself of his terms: if not, I shall take my own line without consulting anyone but myself. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, as he has informed me, has stationed a legion at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416159USip class=place long=15.8897 lat=41.6085>Sipontum</a> respectively. He appears to me to be closing up exits by sea, and yet himself to have his eyes on Greece rather than on Spain. But these considerations are still remote. For the present I am at once excited by the idea of meeting him (and that is now close at hand), and alarmed as to his first political steps. For he will, I presume, want a decree of the senate, and also a decree of the augurs: we shall be hurried off to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or molested, if we hold aloof, with a view of either the praetor holding an election of consuls or naming a dictator, neither of which is constitutional. Although, if <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> was able to secure being named dictator by an interrex, why should he not be able to do so? I see no way out of it, except either meeting the fate of Q. <a href=/people/1024 target=_blank>Mucius</a> from the one, or of L. <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> from the other. By the time you read this, I shall perhaps have had my interview with him. Endure! still worse a fate — no, not even my own old misfortune! In that case there was a hope of a speedy return, there was universal remonstrance. In the present instance I am eager to quit the country, with what hope of return I cannot ever conceive. Again, not only is there no remonstrance on the part of townsmen and countryfolk, but, on the contrary, they are actually afraid of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> as bloodthirsty and enraged. Nevertheless, nothing makes me more wretched than to have stayed here, and there is nothing that I more earnestly desire than to fly away, not so much to share in a war as in a flight. But you were for putting off all plans until such time as we knew what had happened at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. Well, we now know: but we are as undecided as ever. For I can scarcely hope that he will grant me this indulgence; although I have many fair pleas for obtaining it. However, I will at once send you a verbatim report of everything he says to me and I to him. Pray strive with all the affection you have for me to assist me by your caution and wisdom. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is travelling hither at such a pace, that I am unable to have an interview even with Titus <a href=/people/3242 target=_blank>Rebilus</a>, apparently, that he will go to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, but he doesn't want to say so clearly. as I had settled upon doing. I have to conduct the whole business without preparation. Yet, as the hero in the <a href=/people/12112 target=_blank>Odyssey</a> says: Some my own heart, and some will God suggest. Whatever I do you shall know promptly. The demands of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> sent to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and the consuls, for which you ask, I do not possess: nor did Lucius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> bring them in writing. I sent you at the time an account from which you might gather what the demands were. <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>. As to <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>, continue your inquiries as to where he is, and what he contemplates doing. You say that I have written more bitterly about <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> than suits my character. See what an old-fashioned man I am! I thought, upon my honour, that you would be annoyed at this affair more than I was myself. For, besides the fact that I think you ought to be moved by an injury done me by anyone, this man has also in a certain sense outraged yourself in having behaved badly to me. But what account you should take of this it is for you to judge. However, in this matter I don't wish to lay any burden upon you. For my part, I always thought him half cracked, now I think him a scoundrel and a good-for-nothing besides: and yet, after all, not a worse enemy to me than to himself. What you said to Philargyrus was quite right: you certainly have a clear and good case in proving that I had been abandoned rather than had abandoned. When I had already despatched my letter on the 25th, the servants whom I had sent with <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> and <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> brought me a letter, of which this is a copy: MATIUS AND TREBATIUS TO CICERO IMPERATOR: After leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> we heard, while on the road, that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, with all the forces he had, started from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> on the 15th of March: that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> next day entered the town, made a speech, hurried thence for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, intending to be at the city before the 1st of April and to remain there a few days, and then to start for Spain. We thought it the proper thing to do, since we were assured of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s approach, to send your servants back to you, that you might be informed of it as early as possible. We do not forget your charges, and we will carry them out as circumstances shall demand. <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> is making great exertions to reach you before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. After this letter had been written we received tidings that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would stop at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411148PBen class=place long=14.78 lat=41.13>Beneventum</a> on the 25th of March, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 26th, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411139USin class=place long=13.9122 lat=41.1226>Sinuessa</a> on the 27th.

For myself, as I take great delight in this policy for its own sake, so your approval of my action gives me a triumphant feeling of gladness. Nor am I shaken by the fact that those, who were allowed to go free by me, are said to have departed with the intention of renewing the war against me: for there is nothing I like better than that I should be what I am, they what they are. I should be much obliged if you would meet me at the city, that I may, as ever, avail myself in all matters of your counsels and resources. Let me assure you that nothing gives me more pleasure than the presence of your son-in-law <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>.

IX, 18) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM 29 MARCH: I followed your advice in both particulars: for I spoke in such a manner as rather to gain his respect than his thanks, and I stuck to the resolution of not going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I found myself mistaken in one respect — in thinking that he would be easily satisfied. I never saw anything less so. He kept remarking that he was condemned by my decision, that the rest would be the slower to come, if I did not do so. I remarked that their case was unlike mine. After much discussion he said, Come, then, and discuss the question of peace. .  At my own discretion? said I. Am I to prescribe to you? said he. My motion will be this, said I, that the senate disapproves of any going to Spain or taking armies across to Greece, and, I added, I shall make many regretful marks as to Gnaeus. Thereupon he said, Of course, I don't wish such things said. So I supposed, said I, but I must decline being present there, because I must either speak in this sense, and say many things which I could not possibly pass over, if present, or I must not come at all. The upshot was that, by way of ending the discussion, he requested that I would think it over. I couldn't say no to that. So we parted. I feel certain, therefore, that he has no love for me. But I felt warm satisfaction with myself, which hasn't been the case for some time past. For the rest, good heavens! What a crew! What an inferno! to use your word. . What a gang of bankrupts and desperadoes! What is one to say of a son of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, a son of <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> having been in the camp by which <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was besieged? Six legions! He is extra-ordinarily vigilant, extraordinarily bold: I see no limit to the mischief. Now, at any rate, it is time for you to bring out your counsels. This is where you drew the line. Yet his closing remark in our interview, which I had almost forgotten to mention, was very offensive, that if he was not allowed to avail himself of my counsels, he would avail himself of such as he could, and would scruple at nothing. So you have seen with your own eyes, say you, that the man is such as you described him to be. Did it cost you a sigh? Yes, indeed. Tell me the rest. Well, he went straight off to his villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410128UPed class=place long=12.8186 lat=41.8722>Pedum</a>, I to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>. Next I await the twittering swallow — to which you refer. Come, you will say, don't cry over spilt milk: even the leader himself, whom we are following, has made many mistakes. But I wait for a letter from you. For you can't say, as in former ones, Let us see how this turns out. The final test was to be our meeting, and in that I feel certain I have offended him. All the more prompt must be my next step. Pray send me a packet, and full of politics! I am very anxious for a letter from you. </p>                        </div>

IX, 19) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM, 1 APRIL: BEING debarred from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I gave my son his toga virilis at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> in preference to any other place, and my fellow townsmen were gratified at the compliment: though I observed everywhere that both they and others whom I passed in my journey were in low spirits and much dejected. So melancholy and shocking is the contemplation of this tremendous disaster. Levies are being held, the men are being drafted into winter quarters. These are measures which, even when taken by loyal citizens at a time of regular war and with due consideration, are yet in themselves a source of annoyance — how unpopular do you suppose they are in the present instance, when they are being carried out by men of reckless character, in an abominable civil war, and in the most offensive manner? Don't imagine that there is a single scoundrel in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> who is not to be found among them. I saw them en masse at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>. I never, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! believed them to be human beings, and I knew them all: but I had never seen them collected in one place. Let us go, then, whither we have resolved to go, and leave all that is ours behind us. Let us start to join him, to whom our arrival will give greater satisfaction than if we had been together from the first. For at that time we were in the highest hopes, now I, at any rate, have none; nor has anyone except myself left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, unless he regarded <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> as his personal enemy. Nor, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! do I do this for the sake of the Republic, which I regard as completely abolished: but to prevent anyone thinking me ungrateful to the man, who relieved me from the miseries which he had himself inflicted upon me: and at the same time because I cannot endure the sight of what is happening, or of what is certain to happen. Why, I believe that by this time some decrees of the senate have been passed, I hope they may be in the sense of <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a>'s proposal. But what does it matter? Everyone's opinion is the same. But <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> will be the most implacable of all, for he has sent his son with <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a> Titinianus to crush, or at any rate to capture, Gnaeus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>. Yet the latter acts from a motive of fear: but the former? But let us cease showing temper, and let us at last thoroughly realize that we have nothing left, except what I could least have wished-life. As for us, since the Upper Sea is beset, we will sail by the Lower, and if it turns out to be difficult to start from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>, we will make for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/391171PCro class=place long=17.129 lat=39.081>Croton</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397164PTho class=place long=16.49 lat=39.716>Thurii</a>, and like good citizens, devoted to our country, we will play the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirate</a>. I don't see any other way of carrying on this war. We will go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> and ensconce ourselves there. We cannot possibly be his match on land: of peace there is no assurance. But enough of these lamentations. Pray give a letter to <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalio</a> on everything that has been done, and even about what men say, unless they have become entirely tongue-tied. I have followed your advice, and especially in the fact that, in my interview with him, I both maintained my proper dignity and stuck to my refusal to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. As to the rest, pray write to me with the most particular care — for by this time the worst has come to the worst — what course you approve, and what your opinion is. There can, of course, be now no hesitation: still, if anything does occur to you, or rather whatever occurs to you, pray write me word. </p>                        </div>

X, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) LATERIUM, 3 APRIL: Having arrived at my brother's house at <a href=/people/5076 target=_blank>Laterium</a> on the 3rd of April, I received your letter and felt a moment of relief — a thing that hadn't happened to me since these disasters. For I value very highly your approval of my firmness of mind and my course of action. As your announcement that our friend Sextus also approves, the joy that that gives me is as though I imagined myself to be receiving the approbation of his father, for whom I always had a peculiar and special regard. It was he, as I am often accustomed to recall, who, in old times, on the famous 5th of December, when I said, What to do then, Sextus? answered me by quoting: Ah, not a coward's death, nor shorn of fame, But after some high deed to live for aye. His influence, therefore, is still living for me, and his son, who is extremely like him, has the same importance in my eyes as he once had. Pray give him my very kindest regards. You certainly defer giving advice, though not to a very distant date; for I imagine by this time that that suborned peacemaker has had his say, and that some decision has been arrived at in the convention of senators — for I don't consider it a senate-nevertheless, you do keep one in suspense as to what it is to be, yet the less so because I feel no hesitation as to what we ought to do. For when you write word that a legion and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> are being offered to <a href=/people/778 target=_blank>Flavius</a>, and that that business is already being carried out, what crimes must you think are partly being actually proposed and meditated, partly will crop up in the future? I, for my part, shall disregard the law of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> — your countryman, and presently, I think, to be mine — who punished by disfranchisement the man who, in a case of civil disturbance, took neither side. Unless you think otherwise, I shall hold aloof both from the one and the other. But one of the two courses is more decidedly resolved upon in my mind, and yet I will not anticipate. I shall await your advice and the letter (unless you have by this time sent another) which I asked you to deliver to <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalio</a>. You say, not because you have heard it from anyone else, but because it is your personal belief, that I shall be drawn into any negotiation there may be about peace. I have no idea at all of any negotiation for peace being possible, since it is <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s most fixed determination, if he can, to strip <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> of his army and province, unless, perchance, that well-paid friend of yours can persuade him to keep quiet long enough to allow commissioners to go and return. I see nothing to hope for or to think of as possible. Nevertheless, this is itself a point for an honest man to consider: it is important and among the problems of l'haute politique — whether one ought to appear at the council-board of a tyrant, if he is going to discuss some subject good in itself. Wherefore, if anything should turn up of a sort to lead to my being summoned — which for my part does not give me any anxiety, for I have said what I intended saying about peace, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself emphatically repudiated it — but if anything should turn up, write and tell me in any case what you think I ought to do. For nothing has as yet occurred to me requiring more deliberation. I rejoice that you are pleased with the words of <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a>, a good man and a good citizen; and your own frequent exclamation of excellent has been the one thing up to now that has given me pleasure. I am looking eagerly for a letter from you which, indeed, I feel sure is already on its way. You, along with Sextus, have maintained the same dignified resolve as you enjoin upon me. Your friend <a href=/people/1743 target=_blank>Celer</a> is rather a man of learning than of good sense. What <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> has told you about our young men is true. What you mention in your letter does not appear to me to be so formidable in fact as in sound. It is this state of distraction in which we now are that is a kind of death. I had two alternatives before me — either to continue active political life among the disloyal with freedom of action, or to side with the loyalists at whatever risk. Let me either follow the fool-hardy counsels of the loyalists, or attack the reckless measures of the disloyal. Either is dangerous: but what I am now doing is discreditable and yet not safe. I think that your friend who sent his son to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> to negotiate a peace (I am quite of your opinion as to peace, that it is a palpable pretence, and that war is being prepared with the utmost energy) will be commissioned, not myself; of which as yet no word, to my great relief, has been said. I therefore think it the less necessary to write, or even to consider what I should do, if I should happen to be commissioned. </p>                        </div>

X, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 14 APRIL: I have received a large number of letters from you on the same day, all carefully written; one, however, which amounts to a volume, deserving to be read again and again, as I am doing. The labour of writing it was not thrown away, and I am excessively obliged to you. Wherefore, as long as circumstances allow of it, that is, as long as you know where I am, I earnestly beg of you to repeat the experiment as often as possible. Yes, indeed: let there be once for all an end, if possible, to these daily lamentations, or at any rate some sort of restraint in them, which at least is possible. For it is not now the rank, the honours, or the position in life which I have lost that I am thinking of; but what I have actually attained to, the services I have performed, the reputation in which I have lived: in fine, the difference, even in these disastrous circumstances, between myself and those through whom I have lost all. These are the men who thought that, without expelling me from the state, they could not maintain the free gratification of their desires; and you see to what this close alliance and unprincipled coalition of theirs has come! The one leader is in a fever of mad fury and crime: there is no slackening with him: his hand grows heavier every day. Not long ago. he expelled <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Now on one side of the empire he is for pursuing him, on the other for stripping him of his province. He no longer refuses, he even in a sense demands, to have the title of tyrant, as he already is one in fact. The other — the man who once upon a time did not so much as raise me up when I threw myself at his feet — the man who said he could do nothing against <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wish — having evaded the hand and sword of his father-in-law, is now preparing war by land and sea: not an unjust one on his part indeed, but both righteous and even necessary, but yet one fatal to his fellow citizens unless he prove victorious, fraught with disaster even if he is victorious. Not only do I not rate the achievements of these supreme commanders as superior to my own: I do not even consider that their present position is any better, though they seem to be in a very brilliant one, and I to be struggling with a harder fate. For who can be happy who has caused either the abandonment or the invasion of his country? And if, as you remind me, I was right in saying in these books that the only good was virtue, the only evil vice, certainly both those men are in the highest degree miserable, for to both the safety and dignity of their country have always been subordinate to their own power and their private advantage. I am therefore sustained by the purity of my conscience, when I reflect that I either performed the most eminent services to the state, when I had the power, or at least never harboured any but loyal thoughts; and that the republic has been wrecked by precisely the storm which I foresaw fourteen years ago. With such feelings, then, as my companions, shall I set out, not indeed without a bitter pang, and that, not so much for my own or my brother's sake (for our life is practically over) as for our sons, for whom at times it seems to me that we were bound to have secured, among other things, the integrity of the constitution. Of them the one, because he is not after all more dutiful than he is, gives me extraordinary pain: while the other — Oh dear Oh dear! it is the keenest sorrow of my life — corrupted no doubt by our system of indulgence, has gone very far, to a point indeed which I do not venture to describe. I am expecting, too, a letter from you: for you said that you would write at greater length when you had seen the young man himself. All my indulgent conduct to him has been accompanied with considerable strictness, and it is not one only or a small peccadillo of his that I have come down upon, but many and very serious ones; his father's gentleness to him also ought to have secured his affection, rather than such unfeeling disrespect. The fact is that his writing to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> caused us such serious annoyance, that, while we concealed it from you, we yet, I think, made his own life unpleasant. This recent journey of his, however, and his pretence of loyalty to us I do not venture to characterize. I only know that after visiting <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> he was invited to an interview by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that he talked to him about my feeling as being entirely opposed to his own views, and of my design of quitting <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Even this I do not write with confidence. Well, it is not my fault, it is his natural disposition that must cause us alarm. It was this that corrupted <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> and the son of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, not their fathers' fault. My brother is prostrate with grief, and is not so much afraid for his own life as for mine. To this misery pray, pray, bring any consolations that you can; above all I should prefer one — the assurance that the story told us is false or exaggerated. If it is true, I don't see what is to happen in our present state of life, when we are practically exiles. For if the Republic had still had any existence, I should have been at no loss what to do either by way of severity or indulgence. Whether it is the influence of anger, or pain, or fear, I have written this in a tone of greater severity than either your affection for him or mine would seem to warrant. If it is true, you must pardon me: if false, I shall be only too glad to be relieved of my mistake by you. But whatever the truth of the matter may be, you must not attribute any blame to his uncle or father. I had written so far when a message was brought from <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s house that he was coming to call on me. He had arrived at his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa yesterday, that is, the 13th. If his conversation, therefore, furnishes me with any subject worth writing to you, I will append it to this letter. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> passed by my villa and sent me a message to say that he was coming presently, and hurried on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> to make a public speech there. He made his speech, returned, and paid me a very long visit. Monstrous! You know our friend: he made no concealments. To begin with, he said that it was absolutely certain that all who had been condemned under the lex <a href=/people/2655 target=_blank>Pompeia</a> were being recalled, and that accordingly he would avail himself of their services in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. As to the Spains, he had no doubt about their being <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s; and from them <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would himself march with an army wherever <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> was: that an end would be put to the whole mischief by the latter's death: that in an access of anger <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had really wished the tribune <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> to be killed, and that it was within an ace of being done: if it had been done, there would have followed a serious massacre: that a great many people advised one: that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself was not by taste or nature averse from bloodshed, but thought clemency would win him popularity: if, however, he once lost the affection of the people, he would be cruel: he was, again, much disturbed by finding that he had caused ill-feeling among the populace itself by taking the treasury, and therefore that, though he had quite made up his mind to address the people before leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, he had not ventured to do so, and had started with very disturbed feelings. When again I asked what he saw in the future, what final result, and what sort of a constitution, he openly confessed that there was no hope left. He expressed fear of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s fleet, and said that, if it put out to sea, he should abandon <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. What is the meaning of your lictors? said I.  If derived from the senate, why laurelled? If from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, why six? I wanted, said he, to get my authority from a decree of the senate, though by a snatch vote, for it could not be done otherwise. But <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> now dislikes the senate much more than ever. 'Everything,' he says, 'will in future come from me.' But why six?  Because I did not want twelve; I might have had them. Then I said, How I wish I had asked him for what I hear <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> has succeeded in getting! But I was afraid to senate, because his enemies put up the tribune L. <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> to veto every proposal I ask, as I had made no concession to him. He would have gladly given you leave, said he: indeed, consider that you have obtained it; for I will write and tell him, exactly as you like, that we have spoken on the subject. What does it matter to him, since you do not attend the senate, where you are? Nay, at this very moment you would not have damaged his cause in the least by having quitted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. In answer to this I said that I was looking out for some retired and solitary spot, chiefly because I still had lictors. He commended my design. What do you say to this, then? said I. My course to Greece lies through your province, since the coast of the Mare <a href=/people/10331 target=_blank>Superum</a> is guarded by troops. Nothing I should like better, said he. On this subject he spoke at great length and in a very courteous tone. So then I have gained this much, that I can sail not only in safety, but even without concealment. All other subjects of discussion he put off till the next day; and, if any of them seem worth a letter, I will write and tell you. But there are some things which I omitted to ask him: whether <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> intended to wait for an interregnum, or what he meant by saying, as he did, that he was offered the consulship, but refused it for the next year. And there are other points on which I will question him. To crown all he swore — as he usually makes no difficulty of doing — that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> must be very fond of me. Why, what, continued he, did <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> write to me? Pray tell me what. He then declared that <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> had written to say that, for having desired me to come to the city, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had thanked him warmly, and not only expressed approbation, but joy. In short, I was relieved. For the suspicion of domestic treachery and of the conversation with <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> was removed. How I long for young Quintus to be worthy of us, and how I encourage myself to believe what is in his favour! But need he have visited <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>? There is, no doubt, some motive or other; but I would wish it as slight as possible. And, after all, I am surprised at his not yet having returned. But we shall see about all this. Please put the Oppii at <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>'s service. For that is the only danger in the city now. For myself, however, give me the benefit of your advice, as to whether I should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> by land, or start straight from this place on board ship, and on other points; for I am still staying here. I shall have something to write to you about as soon as I have seen <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> again.

X, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 16 APRIL: ABOUT my plans as a whole I have written to you, I think, before in sufficient detail. About the day of my departure I can state nothing for certain, except this: not before the new moon. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s conversation on the second day's inter-view amounted to much the same, except that he indicated still more candidly that he did not see what was to be the end of the business. As to your charge to me to control Quintus ... 'tis a case of asking for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=place long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadia</a>. However, I will omit nothing. And would that you — but I will not be over troublesome. I at once forwarded the packet to <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, and, indeed, he was always asking for it. <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> was more obliging in what he said to you than in what he had written to me. But I cannot wonder enough at the man's carelessness. For <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> having told me that he could buy that lodge of <a href=/people/2725 target=_blank>Canuleius</a> for 50 sestertia, and could get it for even less, if I asked <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> to act, I did ask the latter to obtain a deduction from that sum if he could. He promised to do so. He told me that he had bought it for 30 sestertia, and asked me to let him know to whom I wished it conveyed; saying that the day for payment was the 13th of November. I wrote back somewhat crossly, and yet with a familiar jest. For the present, as he is acting handsomely, I refrain from finding any fault with the man, and I have written to tell him that you have given me full information. Pray let me know about your journey, what you are thinking of doing, and when. 16 April. </p>                        </div>

Let what will happen in Spain, nevertheless my decision stands-partons! I have explained all my ideas to you in a previous letter. Therefore this is a short one, as also because I am in haste and more busy than usual. As to young Quintus, I am doing my best — you know the rest. Your next piece of advice is at once friendly and wise: but everything else will be plain sailing, if I only keep on my guard against him. It is no easy task: there are many perplexing traits in his character: no simplicity, no straightforwardness. I could wish that you.had undertaken the management of the young man. For his father is too indulgent: whenever I tighten the rein, he slackens it again. If I had been able to act without his father, I should have controlled him: and this you can do. But I excuse you: it is, I say, no light task. I regard it as certain that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> is going through <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a> into Gaul.

Not but that in regard to the constitution the right course is the same for us both — but there is now no question of the constitution. It is a contest of rival kings, in which the more moderate king, and the more virtuous and clean-handed of the two, has been defeated, the one, too, whose defeat involves the necessary destruction of the very name of the Roman people: while, if he does conquer, he will use his victory after the manner and precedent of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>. Therefore in this quarrel you must not openly profess adherence to either side, and must wait on events. My position, however, is different, because, being under the bond of an obligation, I cannot show myself ungrateful, and yet do not meditate being at the seat of war, but at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Malta</a> or some similar retired place. Do you do nothing to help the man, you will say, to whom you do not wish to be ungrateful? Nay, I think he would perhaps have been glad if I had done less. But as to this we shall see. Let me only get out of the country, and I have a better opportunity of doing so now that <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> is on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/421170WAdr class=place long=16.95 lat=42.09>Adriatic</a>, <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> straits. However, I have had a certain revival of hope from the fact that <a href=/people/11077 target=_blank>Servius Sulpicius</a> wishes an interview with me. I have sent my freedman <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> with a letter to him: if he chooses to play the man, we shall have a notable tete-a-tete: otherwise ... I shall be the same as ever. <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> has been staying with me: his idea is that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is in low water from having offended the multitude: and he was nervous about going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> should begin naval operations. I gave it to young Quintus when he returned! I perceive that it was a piece of avarice on his part, and a hope of a large bounty. This is a serious evil enough, but the crime which I feared I hope he did not commit. However, I think you are convinced that this vice has not arisen from my indulgence, but from his natural disposition: still I will school and control him. As to the Oppii of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402152PEle class=place long=15.155 lat=40.1608>Velia</a>, please consult with <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>, and arrange as you think proper.

X, 8) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 2 MAY: THE state of affairs itself, as well as your remark and my own observation, make it clear that the time has come to put an end to our correspondence on subjects which it would be dangerous to have intercepted. But as my dear <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> keeps writing to me begging me to wait and see how things go in Spain, and always adds that this is your opinion also, and since I have gathered this also from your own letter, I do not think it out of place to write and tell you what I think on that point. This advice of yours would be prudent, as it seems to me, only if I intended to shape my course of policy in accordance with the result of the Spanish affair, which is impossible. For it is inevitable either that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — what I should like best — is driven from Spain, or that the campaign there will be a protracted one, or (as he seems to feel certain) that he gets Spain into his hands. If he is driven out, how can I then join <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> with any grace or honour, when I should think even <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> himself would desert to him? If, again, the war is protracted, what am I to wait for, and how long? The only alternative is, if we are beaten in Spain, to keep quiet. My view is quite the other way. For I think myself more bound to abandon <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> when he is victorious than when he is beaten, and not more when his success is still uncertain, than when he is quite sure of it. For, if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> conquers, I foresee massacre, an attack on private wealth, a recall of exiles, repudiation of debts, promotion to office of the lowest dregs, and a despotism intolerable, I don't say to any Roman, but even to a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a>. Will it be possible for my indignation to remain silent? Will my eyes be able to endure the sight of myself delivering my vote by the side of <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a> — or, in fact, of his being called on before me? Of your client Sext. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> in attendance? Of C. <a href=/people/1740 target=_blank>Ateius</a>'s client Plaguleius? And so on with the whole list. But why collect the names of my opponents, when I shall be unable to see in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a> without pain my friends whom I have defended, or to associate with them without dishonour. Nay, what if I am not even sure that I shall be allowed to come? His friends write me word that he is by no means satisfied with my conduct in not having appeared in the senate. Am I, nevertheless, to think about making advances to him with a risk to myself, after refusing to be united to him when it was to my advantage? Besides, observe that the decision of the whole controversy does not depend on Spain, unless you really think that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> will throw down his arms if that is lost! On the contrary, his view is entirely that of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>: for he holds that the master of the sea must inevitably be master of the empire. Accordingly, his object has never been to retain Spain for its own sake: the equipment of a fleet has always been his first care. He will take to the sea, therefore, as soon as the season permits, with an enormous fleet, and will approach the shores of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>: and what then will be our position who remain there doing nothing? It will be impossible for us to be any longer neutral. Shall we resist the fleet then? What could be a greater crime, or even so great? In fact, what could be more ignominious? I did not shrink from opposing <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> when I was isolated: shall I do so now with the support of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> and the rest of the nobles? If, however, putting the question of duty aside, I must take account of danger: it is, if I do wrong, that there is danger from these last, from him, if I do right: nor in such miserable circumstances can any policy be discovered so free from danger, as to make me doubt that I should shun doing disgracefully, when it is dangerous, what I should have shunned doing, even had it been safe. Not if I had crossed the sea along with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>? That was impossible in any case: you have only to count the days. But all the same — for let me confess the truth (I do not even attempt concealment), supposing it possible — I was mistaken in a point in which, perhaps, I ought not to have been mistaken: I thought that there would be a reconciliation, and in that case I did not want to have <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> incensed with me, while he was friends with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. For I had learnt to see how exactly alike they were. It was from dread of this that I drifted into this waiting policy. But now I have everything to gain by hastening, everything to lose by delay. And, nevertheless, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, there are auguries also which incite me to action with a certain hope, and no doubtful one, auguries not such as our college derives from <a href=/people/4886 target=_blank>Attus</a>, hut those of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> on tyrants. For I see clearly that he can by no possibility keep his position much longer without bringing on his own collapse, even though we do not exert ourselves: seeing that at the very heyday of his success, and with the charm of novelty upon him, in six or seven days, he brought upon himself the bitterest hatred even of that needy and reckless city rabble itself and had to drop so quickly two of his assumptions — of clemency in the case of <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, of wealth in the matter of the treasury. Of what sort, again, will he find his confederates or subordinates, whichever you please to call them, if those are to rule provinces, of whom not one could manage his own estate two months? I need not enumerate all the points, which no one sees more clearly than yourself. Still, put them before your eyes: you will at once understand that this despotism can scarcely last six months. If I turn out to be mistaken in this, I will bear it, as many most illustrious men, eminent in the state, have borne it, unless you should actually think that I prefer the fate of <a href=/people/630 target=_blank>Sardanapalus</a> — to die in his own bed, rather than in an exile, as was the fate of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a>: who though he had been — in the words of <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> —  the best judge on the shortest reflexion of the question of the moment, and, in regard to the future, by much the shrewdest at conjecturing what was to happen, yet fell into misfortunes which he would have avoided, if nothing had ever escaped him. Though he was a man, as the same writer says, who, however obscure the subject, saw the better and the worse course more clearly than anyone, yet did not see how to avoid the jealousy of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, nor of his own fellow citizens, nor what promise to make to <a href=/people/211 target=_blank>Artaxerxes</a>. Nor would that night have been so fatal to <a href=/people/224 target=_blank>Africanus</a>, nor that day of <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>'s triumph so disastrous to Gaius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, the craftiest of men, if neither of them had ever been mistaken. However, I encourage myself by that prophetic utterance (of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>) which I mentioned. I am not deceived about it, nor will it happen otherwise. Fall he must, either by the hands of his opponents or by his own, who, indeed, is his own most dangerous enemy. I only hope it may happen while we are still alive. Yet it is time for us to be thinking of that continuous life of the future, not of this brief span of our own. But if anything happens to me before that occurs, it will not have made much difference to me whether I live to see it, or have seen it long before. That being so, I must not allow myself to submit to men, against whom the senate armed me with authority to see that the Republic took no harm. All my interests have been confided to you, though they need no recommendation of mine, considering your affection for me. Nor, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, can I hit upon anything to write: for I am sitting waiting sailing orders. Yet I never felt more bound to tell you anything than that none of all the delightful services you have done has been more grateful to my feelings, than your most delicate and careful attentions to my <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>. She has herself been exceedingly charmed with them — as I have been no less. What high qualities she has shown! How admirably she faces the public disaster! How admirably her domestic difficulties! What spirit she has displayed in the matter of my departure! She loves me dearly, she has the deepest sympathy with my feelings — yet she will have me act rightly and preserve my reputation. But don't let me enlarge too much on this theme, lest I should at this juncture rouse my own self-pity. If you get any surer intelligence about Spain, or anything else, pray write and tell me while I am still in the country; and, perhaps, at the moment of my departure I shall send you some intelligence, the more so that <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> thinks that you are at present not thinking of leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. I must put before <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, as I did before <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, my wish to reside in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Malta</a>, and my determination not to take part in this civil war. I only hope I may find him as complaisant and good-natured to me as I did <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>. He is said to be intending to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenum</a> on the 2nd, that is, today: but he has sent me a disagreeable letter in advance, of which I inclose a copy. </p>                        </div>

For myself, I have become hardened. None of my party doubted that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had curtailed his marches: according to him, he is absolutely flying. None doubted <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a> having effected a junction with <a href=/people/847 target=_blank>Afranius</a>: he brings no tidings of the kind. In short, they have also been convinced of this — that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, at the head of a large force, had marched into <a href=/people/557 target=_blank>Germany</a> by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>; for that was announced on good authority. Well, then, I must make for Malta, I think, until we get fresh news from Spain. This, indeed, I almost think from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s own letter that I may do with his approval: for he says that I cannot take a more honourable or safer course than to abstain from the combat altogether. You will say, What has become, then, of that resolution of yours, which you described in your last? It is here, and still unchanged. But would that I had to decide for my own person only! The tears of my family at times weaken my resolution, who beseech me to wait for the result in Spain. <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>'s letter, indeed, which was expressed in moving terms, containing an identical appeal — that I would not so rashly abandon my property, my only son, and all my family — our boys read with floods of tears. Though my own son is, in fact, the braver of the two, and for that very reason affects me more violently. His only anxiety is for my dignity. To <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Malta</a>, then, and thence wherever it shall seem good!

Therefore it matters little that I approve your idea in the present instance, since I have, nevertheless, no power to grant you any exemption. My opinion is that you should communicate with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> direct and ask his leave. I feel no doubt that you will obtain it, especially as you promise that you will take our friendship into consideration. There is a Laconic despatch for you! In any case I will wait for the man himself. He is to arrive on the 3rd, that is, today. Tomorrow, therefore, he will perhaps come to see me. I will test him: I will listen to what he has to say: I will declare loudly that I am in no hurry, that I will communicate with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. I will lie perdu somewhere with the smallest number of attendants possible: at any rate, let these men be ever so reluctant to allow it, from this country I will wing my way, and oh that it might be to <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>! Don't mistake what I say. Something worthy of me shall be effected. This is a new and heavy anxiety: I am much distressed by your strangury. Take medical advice, I beseech you, whilst it is in an early stage. I am delighted with your letter about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=ethnic long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilians</a>. I beg you to let me know if you get any news. I should have liked to have <a href=/people/4629 target=_blank>Ocella</a> with me, if I could manage it without any concealment; and I had extracted from <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> a promise that I should. Here I am waiting for <a href=/people/11077 target=_blank>Servius Sulpicius</a>, for I am requested to do so by his wife and son, and I think it is necessary to see him. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, for his part, is carrying about <a href=/people/5592 target=_blank>Cytheris</a> with him with his sedan open, as a second wife. There are, besides, seven sedans in his train, containing friends female or male See in what disgraceful circumstances we are being done to death: and doubt, if you can, that if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> returns victorious, he will use the sword. For my part, I will withdraw myself in a cock-boat, if I can't get a ship, from their parricidal proceedings. But I shall know more when I have had my interview with him. Our young nephew I cannot help loving, but I see clearly that he does not love me. I never saw a case of such want of principle, of such aversion to his own relations, and of such brooding over mysterious designs. What an overpowering number of anxieties! But it will be my care, as it is now, to correct him. His natural abilities are admirable: it is his character that wants attention. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.10.11'><b>&sect; Att.10.11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCXCV (Att. X, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 4 MAY: AFTER I had sealed my previous packet, I changed my mind about intrusting it to the man to whom I had intended doing so, because he was a stranger. Accordingly, it was not despatched the same day. Meanwhile <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> arrived and delivered me a letter from you. What you say in it about my brother does not, indeed, show as much firmness on his part as one could wish, yet it does not imply any arriere pensee, any treachery, or any obstinate aversion from good, nothing that you cannot turn in any direction you please in one conversation. In short, he holds all his family in great affection — even those with whom he is too often angry — me he loves more dearly than himself. His having written about his boy in one tone to you, and in another to the boy's mother, I see no reason to blame. I am vexed at what you say about the journey and your sister, and the more so that the state of my affairs is such that I can apply no remedy to those things. For I certainly would have done so. But you see my unfortunate position and the desperate state of my affairs. His financial position is not of such a nature — for I hear frequently from him personally — as to prevent his being eager to repay you, and being really anxious on that point. But if such a man as Q. <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>, because I am thus in exile, does not pay me thirteen sestertia, which I lent his son, and pleads the hardness of the times, if Lepta and everybody else do the same, it is wont to make me feel some surprise when he tells me that he is being pressed for an insignificant sum of twenty sestertia. For you, of course, see what his difficulties are. However, he is directing the money to be paid in any case to your order. Do you think him slow or close in business of that kind? No one is less so. Enough about my brother. As for his son: his father has always spoilt him, but his indulgence is not responsible for his being untruthful, or grasping, or wanting in affection for his family, though it perhaps does make him headstrong and self-willed, as well as aggressive. Accordingly, these latter also are traits in his character, which are the results of over-indulgence, but they are pardonable — we must admit-considering what young men are nowadays. Those traits, however, which to me, at least, who love him, are more distressing than the very evils surrounding us, do not arise from excessive compliance on my part: for they have roots of their own, which, however, I would assuredly have torn up, had I been allowed to do so. But my circumstances are such that I must put up with anything. My own son I keep under control without difficulty. He is the most tractable boy possible; but my remorseful pity for him makes me less determined in politics, and the more he desires me to be staunch, the more I fear turning out a cruel father to him. However, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> arrived yesterday in the evening. Presently perhaps he will call on me, or, maybe, will not take even that trouble, since he has written to say what it is his pleasure should be done. But you shall know the result at once. Secrecy is my only course now. What can I do about the boys? Shall I trust them to a small vessel? What sort of courage do you think I shall have in the voyage? Why, I remember while sailing in that open <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=demonym long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodian</a> vessel in the summer how anxious I was: what do you think will be the case in a small despatch boat in the dangerous season of the year? <a href=/people/5844 target=_blank>Misery</a> on every side! <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> is with me, a right good man and good citizen. What frightful news he brings me, good heavens! Is even <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> thinking, then, of an entree into the senate? But I will give him a letter himself for you tomorrow. Yes, I believe <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> is, as you say, friendly to me. I answered him with rather a peppery jest, because he wrote to me somewhat abruptly about providing for payment of the money. Pray smooth him down, if he took it less good-temperedly than one could wish. I addressed him as monetalis, because he addressed me as proconsul. But as he is a good fellow and attached to me, let me keep my affection for him too. Farewell. </p>                        </div>

Who is there, I don't say more unfortunate, but in a more degraded position? <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> says that he has received express orders about me, and, nevertheless, he has as yet not been to see me, but told <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> this fact. What am I to do now? Nothing succeeds with me, and the plans which I form with the greatest care are just those which fail in the most shocking manner. Why, I thought when I had got <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s consent, that I had succeeded entirely. He had written about me to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. Reginus was wholly in my interests. I never imagined that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> would have anything to do with the western sea. Which way am I to turn now? I am watched on every side. But enough of tears! Well, then, I must steal away and creep stealthily into some merchant vessel: I must not expose myself to the suspicion of having connived at my being prevented from going. I must make for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. If I once get there, I shall then have a greater step in my power. If things would only go as they should in Spain! However, I only hope the news about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> may prove true: but as yet we have had no luck. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> are said to have rallied round <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, to have begged him to hold out, making all manner of promises. Affected by this, he is said to have begun holding a levy. I don't believe it, however distinguished the authority! I am aware that this province was at least capable of being held. However, we shall presently have news from Spain. We have C. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> here, who is entertaining the same thoughts as myself, either sincerely, or making a good pretence of doing so. I have not, however, seen him personally, but have been told this by one of his most intimate friends. Pray send me any news you have: if I take any active step, I will at once let you know. I will treat young Quintus with more strictness. Would that I could do any good! However, pray some time or other tear up the letters in which I have written about him in a tone of severity, for fear of anything getting out at any time. I will do the same with yours. I am still waiting for <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, nor do I hear anything satisfactory from him. You shall know whatever does occur. Without doubt I must confess to having made a mistake. For the first time? Or on one subject? Nay, the more deeply I have reflected on a thing, the more unwisely has its execution invariably been. But The past is past: though grieved, I'll let it be. Let us only take care not to come to grief in the future. Well, you bid me make provision for my journey. What am I to provide? The possible accidents cover so wide a field, that, if I shrink from them, I must remain stationary with dishonour and sorrow; if I pay no heed to them, there is danger of my falling into the hands of unprincipled men. Only see in what a miserable position I am! At times I think that I should absolutely desire to receive some injury, however mortifying, from the Caesarians, to convince people that I have become an object of hatred to the tyrant. But if the voyage, on which I set my hopes, had been open to me, I would have certainly effected something, as you wish and advise, to justify my delay. But the closeness of the watch set upon me is surprising, and even <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> himself is an object of suspicion. So the two alternatives are to take the high hand, or to act secretly. If the former, I must have favourable weather. The latter means concealment from those men: and if any contretemps occurs in doing that, you must see in what an undignified position I shall be. I am at the mercy of circumstances, and must not shrink from a somewhat bold course. I often think of <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>, and, if ever I have the like opportunity, I will not let it slip. I hope Spain is safe. The action of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=ethnic long=5.36 lat=43.3>Massilians</a> is at once glorious in itself, and a proof to me that things are going well in Spain. They would not have been so bold, if it had been otherwise: and they would be sure to know, for they are close at hand as well as careful. Again, I am glad of your remark as to the popular dislike expressed in the theatre. Even these legions, which he took over in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, I can see are very much disaffected to him. However, he has no worse enemy than himself. I quite agree with your dread that he may run amuck. If he once feels desperate, he certainly will do so. All the more reason for effecting something in the spirit (and, I hope, with better fortune) of <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>. But one thing at a time: whatever it may be, you shall at once know all about it. I will furnish young Quintus with supplies, as you request, and will undertake the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> task, or the whole <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=place long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesus</a>, if you like. Yes: he has ability, if he had but character. . .. And if he hasn't any as yet, he may acquire it, or virtue is not teachable, which I cannot be persuaded to believe. </p>                        </div>

A letter from you always brings a ray of hope. Pray write, therefore, and if you can suggest anything hopeful, don't omit to do so. No, don't be afraid of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lions</a>. He is a charming fellow! Just listen to a statesman's conduct of affairs! He sent round a letter summoning ten leading men and the quattuorviri from the municipal towns. They came to his villa in the morning. In the first place, he remained asleep till nine o'clock. Then on the announcement that the men had arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> — for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is angry with these towns — he ordered them to come again next day: he wanted to take a bath and to cure a looseness of the bowels. This was yesterday. Today, however, he purposes crossing to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408139IPit class=place long=13.883 lat=40.755>Aenaria</a>. He intends promising the exiles there that they shall be recalled. But enough of that. To return to ourselves: I have received a letter from Q. <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a>. Thanks, about Tiro. <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> is a good fellow. I have repaid <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> is said to have stopped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412138UMin class=place long=13.7684 lat=41.242>Minturnae</a> on the 6th of May, today he is to stop with C. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> in his villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/409140ULit class=place long=14.0298 lat=40.9212>Liternum</a>. Early tomorrow, therefore, he will see me and will give me a theme for a letter to you. For at the present moment I can't think of anything to write to you about. One thing does surprise me, that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> has not sent me even a message, especially as he has paid a great deal of attention to me. No doubt he is charged with some still sterner order as to me. He doesn't wish to say No to me face to face. I never meant to ask him the favour, nor, if he had granted it, should I have trusted his word. However, I will think out some plan. Please tell me any news from the Spains: for by this time it will be possible for some to be heard: and everybody's idea is that, if all is well there, there will be no more trouble. I, however, don't regard our cause as won if we retain them, nor utterly desperate if we lose them. <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> and <a href=/people/4629 target=_blank>Ocella</a> and the rest, I suppose, are detained.

X, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 8 MAY: WHAT a miserable state of existence! To be so long in fear is a greater evil than the very thing which is feared. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> having arrived, as I told you before, on the 15th of May came to see me next day. Not to keep you in suspense, we arrived at no conclusion as to our policy. I never saw anybody so completely beside himself with fear; and yet, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, he feared nothing that was not a legitimate object of fear: Pompey was angry with him, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> no friend to him: the victory of either one or the other was alarming, both because of the cruel nature of the one, the unscrupulousness of the other, and also because of the financial embarrassment of both, which could be relieved from no source except that of the property of private persons. And these remarks were accompanied with such floods of tears, that I wondered they had not run dry from such protracted misery. For my part, even the inflammation of the eyes, which prevents my writing to you with my own hand, is not accompanied with a single tear, but is very often troublesome from keeping me awake. Wherefore any consolations you can think of collect and write, not from philosophy and books — for of that I have a stock at home, though somehow or other the medicine is less potent than the disease: rather search for such news as that about Spain or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>, indeed, brings a very satisfactory report about them, and also tells me that there is good authority for the story of the two legions. That is the sort of news, if you have any, and more like it. And, indeed, something must be heard before many days are over. But I return to <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. We in the end adjourned our conversation to the next day: but he is slow about leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. He would much rather die in his own bed, whatever is to happen. He feels a painful hesitation as to his son's service at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. There was one thing that he declared with the utmost determination: if the condemned men were restored, he would go into exile. To this I replied that that would certainly take place; and what was already being done was no less offensive, and I mentioned a number of instances. However, these arguments did not increase his resolution, only his terror: so that I think he is rather to be kept in the dark about my plan, than invited to adopt the same. So there is not much to be got from him. In obedience to your hint I will turn my thoughts to <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>. </p>                        </div>

X, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 12 MAY: WHILST <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> was still with me, <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalio</a> arrived with your letter of the 10th, which inspired me with a strong hope of a change for the better in regard to the eight cohorts; for those, too, which are stationed in these parts are said to be wavering. On the same day Funisulanus brought me a letter from you, in which the same news was repeated still more positively. I gave him full satisfaction as to his own business, ascribing the full credit to you. Up to this time I have had reason to be discontented with him, for he owes me a large sum of money and is not considered to be well off. Now he says he will pay me: that a man to whom he had lent money was slow in paying; that, if you have in your hands what his debtor has paid, you are to give it to letter-carriers for me. The amount you will learn from <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a>'s man <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>. But let us return to more important matters. The Caelian plan, which is your idea, is coming to fruition. Accordingly, I am distracted as to whether to wait for a favourable wind. What is wanted is a standard: men will flock to it. I quite agree with your advice to set out openly, and so I think I shall start. Meanwhile, however, I am awaiting a letter from you. <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>'s advice doesn't ease matters at all. Every kind of objection is obtruded in every opinion he utters. I never knew anyone more timid except Gaius <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, who is sorry that he was ever consul. What a mean fellow! why, he is even said to have encouraged <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> to prevent my departure, in order, I suppose, to stay himself with greater decency. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, however, started for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> on the 10th. He sent me a message to say that he had been deterred by a feeling of shame from calling on me, because he thought that I was angry with him. So I shall go, and in the way, too, which you think right, unless some hope shall have been meanwhile presented to me of undertaking some still more important part. But that will scarcely be the case so soon. Alienus the praetor, however, thinks that some one of his colleagues would do it, if I don't. Anyone you please, so long as it is some one. In regard to your sister, I commend you. As to the young Quintus, I am doing all I can. I hope things are better. As to my brother Quintus, let me tell you that he is in considerable anxiety about raising money to pay his debt, but as yet has squeezed nothing out of L. <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a>. <a href=/people/3001 target=_blank>Axius</a> is modest about the twelve sestertia! For he repeatedly put in his letter a request that I would pay <a href=/people/3393 target=_blank>Gallius</a> whatever he wanted. Could I have done otherwise, if he had not mentioned it? And, in fact, I often promised: but he wanted that round sum promptly. They should have rather come to my assistance at this time of difficulty, heaven confound them! However, more of this another time. I am very glad that you, and <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> too, are relieved of your quartan ague. Whilst bread and other stores are being got on board, I intend to make an excursion to my Pompeian villa. Please thank <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> for his kindness.

X, 16) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 14 MAY: I HAD just despatched a letter to you on a variety of subjects, when <a href=/people/23 target=_blank>Dionysius</a> arrived at my house very early in the morning. I would not only have shown myself placable to him, but would have pardoned him altogether, had he arrived in the frame of mind described by you. For in your letter received at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> you said that he was coming and was prepared to do whatever I wished. For my part, I wished, or rather desired, that he should stay with me: and it was because, on his coming to my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=demonym long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formian</a> villa, he had refused point blank to do so, that I used to write to you somewhat sharply about him. Well, he said very little, but the upshot of his remarks was that I must excuse him, that his private affairs prevented his going with me. I answered shortly: I felt much pained: I quite understood that my position roused his contempt. You will perhaps be surprised, but I assure you that I feel this to be among the heaviest blows which this crisis has inflicted upon me. I hope he may be loyal to you: that is equivalent to wishing you to remain prosperous: he will be so, just as long as you are. I hope my design will be free of all risk: for, on the one hand, I have kept it dark; and, on the other, I shall not, I think, be very closely watched. May I only have a voyage such as I wish! For all the rest — as far, that is, as they can be provided for by prudence-measures shall be taken. Pray, as long as I am in the country, write and tell me not only anything you know or have heard, but also what you foresee will happen. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, who might have held <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> without any trouble-and, if he had held it, all loyalists would have joined him — sailed from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> on the 23rd of April, as <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> has written to tell me. I only hope, as the phrase is, that <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> may hold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402920ISar class=place long=9.2 lat=40.2>Sardinia</a>; for there is rumour going about. Oh, if that were to be so, what a stigma on <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>! In order to allay suspicion of my leaving the country, or of what I am thinking of doing, I started for my Pompeian villa on the 12th of May, with a view of staying there, while the necessary preparations for my voyage were being made. On my arrival at my villa people came to see me: The centurions of the three cohorts stationed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> — this is what our friend <a href=/people/9894 target=_blank>Ninnius</a> reported to me — wished to visit me the next day: they were desirous of putting themselves and the town in my hands. I, however, I can tell you, was off from my villa next morning before daybreak, to prevent them having any opportunity of seeing me at all. For what was the good of three cohorts? Or even if there were more, what equipment had they? I thought, indeed, of those exploits of <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a>, which I found mentioned in your letter received as soon as I arrived at my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa, which I did on the same day: yet at the same time it might have been a trap to catch me. I therefore removed all suspicion. But while I was on my return journey, <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> had arrived and had turned out of his road to call on <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, and used very courteous expressions about me. However, I believe I shall see him; for he has sent a servant to tell me that he is coming to my house. This is better behaviour than that of my fellow augur <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, among whose lictors an actress is riding in a sedan. As you are free of your quartan ague, and have not only got rid of your new disease, but also of your cold, be sure you present yourself before me in Greece full of vigour, and meanwhile let me have something by way of a letter. </p>                        </div>

X, 17) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 16 MAY: ON the 14th <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> came to call on me after I had written my letter. I only wish the rest of his conduct had been the same. You could hardly conceive such epanouissement! I mean, I can tell you, to make use of it. Then came <a href=/people/3248 target=_blank>Serapion</a> with your letter, before opening which I remarked to him that you had written to me about him before, as you had done. Then, after opening the letter, I told him the rest of your compliment to the last syllable: and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, I esteem him to be a good, learned, and honest man. And, what is more, I think of using his ship and taking him with me on my voyage. The inflammation in my eyes frequently recurs, not, indeed, to a very painful extent, but enough to prevent my writing. I am glad that your health is re-established, both from your old complaint and your more recent troubles. I could wish I had <a href=/people/4629 target=_blank>Ocella</a> with me. For I think the weather here is going to be slightly calmer. At present the equinox is delaying us, which has been very stormy. After that, if there is a brisk wind, I can only hope that <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> may remain in the same mind: since up to this time nothing could exceed his courtesy. You wonder at what I said about a passport, as though I had insinuated some grave charge or other against you. For you say you can't make out how it ever came into my mind. Well, since you had mentioned in your letter that you were thinking of leaving the country, and since I had been told that no one could do so without one, I thought, of course, that you had one, and also because you had taken out a passport for the boys. That was the ground of my belief, and, nevertheless, I wish you would write and tell me what you are thinking of doing, and above all what news is now stirring. 16 May. </p>                        </div>

X, 18) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CUMAE, 19 MAY: My <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> was confined on the 19th of May — a boy, a seven months' child. I have reason to be thankful that she had a good delivery. The child itself is a poor little weakling. An astonishingly dead calm has as yet kept me from starting, and has been a greater impediment than the watch kept upon me. For all that talk of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> was mere persiflage. The truth will turn out to be this: that most dissolute of men has been corrupted by his freedman <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a>. Accordingly, henceforth I shall not write and tell you what I am going to do, but only what I have done. For all the eavesdroppers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/365342PCor class=place long=34.151 lat=36.464>Corycus</a> seem to be listening to what I say. Do you, however, I beg, continue to tell me any news there are of Spain, or anything else; but don't expect a letter from me, except when I have arrived at my wished-for destination, or in case I can send anything during my voyage. Even this I write with fear and trembling: so slowly and heavily does everything drag on. The foundation was badly laid, the rest follows suit. I am now making for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=place long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formiae</a>: perhaps the <a href=/people/1744 target=_blank>Furies</a> will follow me there too. However, to judge from <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s conversation with you, my idea of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/359144IMel class=place long=14.44 lat=35.88>Malta</a> does not find favour. Can you doubt, therefore, that he regards me as an enemy? I have, to be sure, written to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> telling him that you had mentioned to me in a letter both his kindly feeling and his suspicion. I thanked him. On the second point I cleared myself with him. Did you ever know anyone more unlucky? I won't say more, lest I should make you suffer too. I am overpowered with the thought that the time has come when I no longer have the power of acting either with courage or with prudence. </p>                        </div>

XI, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) EPIRUS (JANUARY) I have received from you the sealed document conveyed by <a href=/people/3121 target=_blank>Anteros</a>. I could gather nothing from it about my domestic affairs. What gives me the most painful anxiety about them is the fact that the man who has acted as my steward is not at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, nor do I know where in the wide world he is. My one hope of preserving my credit and property is in your most thoroughly proved kindness; and if in this unhappy and desperate crisis you still maintain that, I shall have greater courage to endure these dangers which are shared with me by the rest of the party. I adjure and intreat you to do so. I have in Asia in cistophori money amounting to 2,200,000 sesterces. By negotiating a bill of exchange for that sum you will have no difficulty in maintaining my credit. If indeed I had not thought that I was leaving that quite clear — in reliance on the man on whom you have long since known that I ought to have no reliance — I should have stayed in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> for some little time longer, and should not have left my finances embarrassed: and I have been the longer in writing to you because it was a long time before I understood what the danger to be feared was.

XI, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) EPIRUS, 5 FEBRUARY: I received your letter on the 4th of February, and on the same day formally accepted the inheritance in accordance with the will. Of my many and most distressing anxieties one is removed, if; as you say, this inheritance is sufficient to maintain my credit and reputation; though even without any inheritance I am aware that you would have defended them by all means at your disposal. As to what you say about the dowry, 54 I adjure you, in the name of all the gods, to undertake that whole business and protect the poor girl, whom my default and carelessness have reduced to distress, by the aid of funds belonging to me, if there are such, of your own if you can do so without inconvenience. You say that she is without any means: pray do not allow that state of things to continue. Why, what are the payments that have swallowed up the rents of my estates? For instance, one ever told me that the sixty sestertia, which you mention, had been deducted from the dowry; for I should never have allowed it. But this is the smallest of the frauds from which I have suffered: of which sorrow and tears prevent my writing to you. Of the money deposited in Asia I have called in nearly half. It seemed likely to be safer where it now is than in the hands of the publicani. You exhort me to be of good courage: I could have wished that you were able to allege some reason for my being so. But if to my other misfortunes there has been added the confiscation of my town house, which <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> told me was in contemplation (you gave me no hint of it), who is he now in all the world in a worse plight than myself? I beg and beseech you, — pardon me, I can write no more. You must see what a crushing weight of sorrow mine is. If it were only such as is common to me with the rest of those who are regarded as being in the same position as myself, my error had seemed less grave and therefore more easy to bear. As it is, there is no consolation, unless you secure (if it is not now too late to secure it) that I have no special loss or wrong inflicted upon me. I have been somewhat slow in sending back your letter-carrier, because there was no opportunity of getting him across. Pray send letters in my name to any to whom you think it right to do so. You know my intimates. If they remark on the absence of my signet or handwriting, pray tell them that I have avoided using either owing to the military pickets. </p>                        </div>

XI, 3) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) CAMP OF POMPEY IN EPIRUS, 13 JUNE: What is going on here you will be able to ascertain from the bearer of your letter. I have detained him longer than I otherwise should, because I am in daily expectation of something happening, and even now I have, after all, no other motive for despatching him except the subject on which you asked for an answer from me, namely, my wish as to the 1st of July. Both courses are dangerous-either the risk of so large a sum of money at so critical a time, or the divorce, of which you speak, while the result of the campaign is still uncertain. Wherefore, I leave this, as I do other things, as absolutely as possible to your care and kindness, and to her consideration and wishes, for whose interests-poor girl I-I should have consulted better, if I had formerly deliberated with you personally on our safety and property rather than by letter. You say that in the common misfortune there is no danger threatening me more than anyone else. Well, there is some consolation certainly in that; yet there are also after all many circumstances peculiar to myself, which you must certainly see to be very dangerous and such as I might very easily have avoided. However, they will be less grave, if, as is the case at present, they are mitigated by your management and activity. The money is lodged with <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a>. There, as far as I am concerned, let it remain. The present state of things cannot, I think, last long: so that I shall presently be able to know what it is most necessary to do. I am, however, hard put to it for every kind of thing, because he with whom I am is in straits too, and I have lent him a large sum of money, under the idea that, when things are settled, that measure will be to my honour also. 64 Yes, please, as before, if there are any persons whom you think ought to have a letter from me, compose one yourself. 65 Remember me to your family. Take care of your health. First and foremost, as you say in your letter, by every means in your power be careful to see that nothing is wanting to her, 66 on whose account you know that I am most unhappy.

They were so powerful as to effect what you see. 75 Accordingly I cannot think of anything to say to you about my affairs or to ask of you. The actual result and the upshot of the whole business is before you. I have myself gathered from your letters-both the one written in conjunction with others, and the one in your own name — that (as I saw independently) being in a manner unnerved by the unexpected turn of affairs, you are trying to find other methods of protecting me. You say in your letter that you think I ought to come nearer, and make my journey through the towns by night: but I cannot at all see how that can possibly be done. For neither have I suitable stopping-places, in which I could possibly pass all the hours of daylight, nor for the object which you have in view does it much matter whether men see me in a town or on the road. However, I will consider even this, as I shall other plans, to see how it can be most advantageously managed. For myself, owing to my extraordinary uneasiness both of body and mind, I have been incapable of composing numerous letters: I have only answered those who have written to me. Pray write to <a href=/people/6129 target=_blank>Basilus</a> and to others to whom you think it proper-even to <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a> 76 — in my name, and say whatever you think right. As to the long interval during which I have written nothing at all to you, you will understand from this letter that what I lacked was a subject to write about, not willingness to write. You ask about <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>. 77 I should not have wanted attentions from him nor from anyone else either, if they could have found any way to be of use to me.

If I thought that to be the case, it would lessen my pain. Believe me, you say. I believe you of course, but I know how anxious you are to soothe my pain. Of abandoning the war I have not repented for a moment. So bloodthirsty were their sentiments, so close their alliance with barbarous tribes, that a scheme of proscription was formed-not against individuals, but whole classes — and the conviction was universally entertained by them that the property of you all was the prize of his victory. I say you advisedly: for even as to you personally there were never any but the harshest ideas. Wherefore I shall never repent of my decision: what I do repent of is my plan of procedure. I could have wished that I had rather remained in some town until invited to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. 79 I should have exposed myself to less remark and have felt less pain; this particular regret would not have been wringing my heart. To lie idle at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> is vexatious in every point of view. As to coming nearer the city, as you advise, how can I do so without the lictors given me by the people? They cannot be taken from me as long as I am possessed of my civil rights. These lictors, as a temporary measure, when approaching the town, I caused to mingle with the crowd with only sticks in their hands, to prevent any attack on the part of the soldiery. 80 Since then I have confined myself to my house. 81 I wrote to ask <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> and <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> to turn over in their minds as to how they thought that I should approach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I think they will advise my doing so. For they undertake that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will be anxious not only to preserve, but to enhance my position, and they exhort me to be of good courage, and to hope for the most distinguished treatment in all respects. This they pledge themselves to and affirm. Yet I should have felt more sure of it, if I had remained where I was. But I am harping upon what is past. Look therefore, I beg of you, to what remains to be done and investigate the case in conjunction with them; and if you think it necessary and they approve, let <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> and anyone else be called into council, that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s approbation of my step may be the better secured as having been taken in accordance with the opinion of his own friends, and let them write and tell <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> that whatever I have done I have done in accordance with their judgment. My dear <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>'s ill-health and weakness frightens me to death. I gather that you are showing her great attention, for which I am deeply grateful. I never had any doubt about what would be the end of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. Such a complete despair of his success had taken possession of the minds of all the kings and nations, that I thought this would happen wherever he landed. I cannot but lament his fall: for I know him to have been honest, pure, and a man of principle. 82 Am I to condole with you about <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>? 83 He used to indulge in mischievous talk about your remaining at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: while L. <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> had promised himself <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>'s town house, 84 <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s suburban villa, and an estate at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a>. This sort of thing is going on upon this side in precisely the same way. The only difference is that in the former case there was no limit. For all who remained in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> were held to be enemies. But I should like to talk over this some time or other when my mind is more at ease. I am told that my brother Quintus has started for Asia, to make his peace. About his son I have heard nothing. But ask <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s freedman <a href=/people/7600 target=_blank>Diochares</a>, who brought the letter you mention from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. I have not seen him. He is said to have seen Quintus on his way — or perhaps in Asia itself. I am expecting a letter from you, as the occasion demands. Pray take care to get it conveyed to me as soon as possible. 27 November. </p>                        </div>

XI, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 17 DECEMBER: I am much obliged for your letter, in which you have set forth with great care all that you thought had any bearing on my position. Is it the case then, as you say in your letter, that your friends think that I should retain my lictors on the ground that <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> has been allowed to do so? 85 But in his case I don't consider that his own lictors have been allowed him, but that lictors have been given him by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself. 86 For I am told that he refuses to acknowledge any decrees of the Senate passed after the withdrawal of the tribunes. 87 Wherefore he will be able without forfeiting his consistency to acknowledge my lictors. However, why should I talk about lictors, who am all but ordered to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>? For <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> has sent me a copy of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter to him, in which he says that he has been told that <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> and L. <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> had come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, with the intention of living openly at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: that he disapproved of that, for fear of its being the cause of disturbances: and that all are forbidden to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> except those whose case he had himself investigated. And on this point the language of the despatch is very strong. Accordingly, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> in his letter to me begged me to excuse him: he could not but obey that letter. Then I sent L. <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> to him, to point out that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had told <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> to write and bid me come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> at the first opportunity: that I had come in consequence of his letter. 88 Thereupon he made a special exception in his edict of myself and <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> by name. I had much rather he had not done that; for the exception itself could have been made without mentioning names. 89 Oh, what endless, what formidable dangers! However, you are doing your best to mitigate them: and not without success, — the very fact that you take such pains to lessen my distress lessens it. Pray do not get tired of doing so as frequently as possible. Now, you will best succeed in your object, if you can persuade me to think that I have not entirely forfeited the good opinion of the loyalists. And yet what can you do in that regard? Nothing, of course. But if circumstances do give you any opportunity, that is what will best be able to console me. I see that at present this is impossible, but if any thing should turn up in the course of events, as in the present instance! It used to be said that I ought to have left the country with <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>. His death has disarmed criticism on that sin of omission. But of all things the one most found wanting in me is that I have not gone to Africa. Now my view of the question was this, — I did not think that the constitution ought to be defended by foreign auxiliaries drawn from the most treacherous race, especially against an army that had been frequently victorious. They perhaps disapprove that view. For I hear that many loyalists have arrived in Africa, and I know that there were many there before. On this point I am much pressed. Here again I must trust to luck, — that Some of them, or, if possible, all should be found to prefer their personal safety. For if they stick to their colours and prevail, you perceive what my position will be. You will say, What about them, if they are beaten? Such a blow is more creditable to them. These are the thoughts that torture me. You did not explain in your letter why you do not prefer <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>'s 90 policy to mine. Though it is not so reputable that of <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, yet it is free from danger and vexation. The last case is that of those who remain in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>. Even they are in a better position than I am, in two respects: there are many together in one place; and, when they do come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, they will come straight back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. Pray continue your present efforts to soften these difficulties and to secure the approbation of as many as possible. You apologize for not coming to me: I however am well acquainted with your reasons, and I also think it to my advantage that you should be where you are, if only to make to the proper people — as you are actually doing — the representations that have to be made in my behalf. Above all pray observe this. I believe that there are a number of people who have reported or will report to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> either that I repent of the course I have adopted, or do not approve of what is now going on: and, though both statements are true, yet they are made by them from an unfriendly feeling to me, not because they have perceived them to be so. In regard to this everything depends on <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> supporting my cause, and on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s kind disposition towards me being confirmed by frequent letters from them. Pray do your utmost to secure that. A second reason for my not wishing you to leave <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is that you mention in your letter that <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> implores your help. What a misfortune I What am I to say? What can I wish? I will be brief: for a sudden flood of tears stops me. I leave it to you. Do as you think right. Only be careful that at such a crisis as this there may be no danger to her safety. Pardon me, I beseech you: I cannot dwell on this topic any longer for tears and grief. I will only say that nothing is more soothing to my feelings than your affection for her. I am obliged to you for seeing to letters being sent to those to whom you think it necessary. 91 I have seen a man who says that he saw young Quintus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=place long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samos</a>, and his father at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a>. They will easily obtain their pardons. I only hope that, as they will have seen <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> first, they may choose to aid me with him as much as I should have wished to aid them, if I had had the power! You ask me not to be annoyed if there are any expressions in your letter likely to give me pain. Annoyed! Nay, I implore you to write everything to me with complete candour, as you do, and to do so as often as possible. Good-bye. 15 December. </p>                        </div>

I am being severely punished for my rashness, which you wish me to consider prudence; and I do not wish to prevent your maintaining that view and mentioning it in letters as often as possible. For your letter gives me sensible relief at such a time as this. You must exert yourself to the utmost by means of those who are favourably disposed to me and are influential with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, especially by means of <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, to induce them to write on my behalf as zealously as possible. For I am being attacked, as I hear, both by certain persons who are with him and by letter. We must counteract them as vigorously as the importance of the matter demands. <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> 92 is there, a very bitter enemy of mine. Quintus has sent his son not only to plead on his own behalf, but also to accuse me. He gives out that he is being assailed by me before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, though <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself and all his friends refute this. Indeed he never stops, wherever he is, heaping every kind of abuse upon me. Nothing has ever happened to me so much surpassing my worst expectations, nothing in these troubles that has given me so much pain. People who say that they heard them from his own lips, when he was publicly talking at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sicyon</a> in the hearing of numerous persons, have reported some abominable things to me. You know his style, perhaps have even had personal experience of it: 93 well, it is all now turned upon me. But I increase my sorrow by mentioning it, and perhaps do the same to you. Wherefore I return to what I was saying: take care that <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> sends someone expressly for this purpose. Pray have letters sent in my name to whom you choose.

XI, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 3 JANUARY: Yes, it is quite as you say: I have acted both incautiously and in too great a hurry; nor have I any hope, seeing that I am only allowed to remain by special clauses of exemption in the edicts. If these had not been secured by your industry and kindness, I might have betaken myself to some lonely places. As it is, I can't even do that. For how does my having come before the new tribuneship help me, if' my having come at all is of no service to me? 94 Or what am I to expect from a man who was never friendly to me, 95 when my ruin and humiliation are now secured by an actual law? Already <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>'s letters to me become daily less cordial, and a great number from many hands reach <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, perhaps against me. I am perishing by my own fault. It is not chance that has caused me any misfortune, everything has been incurred by my own mistakes. The fact is that when I saw what sort of war it was going to be, and that universal unreadiness and feebleness were pitted against men in the highest state of preparation, I had made up my mind to a policy, not so much courageous, as one that I of all men was justified in adopting. I gave in to my relations, or rather, I obeyed them. What the real sentiments of one of them was-his whom you recommend to my forbearance 96 — you will learn from his own letters, which he has sent to you and others. I should never have opened them, had it not been for the following circumstance. The bundle was brought to me. I untied it to see whether there was any letter for me. There was none. There was one for <a href=/people/1575 target=_blank>Vatinius</a>, and another for <a href=/people/5749 target=_blank>Ligurius</a>. 97 I ordered them to be delivered to these persons. They immediately came to me boiling with indignation, loudly exclaiming against the villain. They read me the letters full of every kind of abuse of me. <a href=/people/5749 target=_blank>Ligurius</a> raved: said, that he knew that Quintus was detested by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, and yet that the latter had not only favoured him, but had also given him all that money out of compliment to me. Thus outraged I determined to ascertain what he had said in his letters to the rest. For I thought it would be fatal to Quintus himself if such a villainy on his part became generally known. I found that they were of the same kind. I am sending them to you, and if you think that it is for his interest that they should be delivered, please to deliver them. It won't do me any harm. For as to their having had their seals broken, <a href=/people/3074 target=_blank>Pomponia</a> possesses his signet, I think. 98 When he displayed that exasperation at the beginning of our voyage, 99 he grieved me so deeply that I was quite prostrate after it, and even now he is said to be working not so much for himself as against me. So I am hard pressed by every kind of misery, and can hardly bear up against it, or rather cannot do so at all. Of these miseries there is one which outweighs all the others — that I shall leave that poor girl deprived of patrimony and every kind of property. Wherefore pray see to that, according to your promise: for I have no one else to whom to commend her, since I have discovered that the same treatment is prepared for her mother as for me. But, in case you don't find me here when you come, still consider that she has been commended to you with due solemnity, and soften her uncle in regard to her as much as you can. I am writing this to you on my birthday: on which day would that I had never been born, or that nothing had afterwards been born of the same mother I Tears prevent my writing more. </p>                        </div>

My connexion Publius <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> was employed as deputy master of his company in Asia in collecting the harbour dues and the pasture rents. He saw the younger Quintus at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> on the 8th of December, and entertained him warmly for the sake of our friendship, and on asking some questions about me, he tells me that Quintus replied that he was bitterly opposed to me, and showed him a roll containing a speech which he intended to deliver against me before <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> says that he dissuaded him from such a senseless proceeding at great length; and that afterwards at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a> the elder Quintus talked a great deal to him in a similar strain of treachery. The latter's furious state of mind you have been able to gather from the letters which I sent on to you. I know these things are painful to you: they are positive torture to me, and the more so that I don't think I shall have the opportunity of even remonstrating with them. As to the state of things in Africa, my information is widely different from your letter. They say that nothing could be sounder or better organized. Added to that, there is Spain, an alienated <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, a decline in the loyalty and the strength of the legions, total disorder in the city. Where can I find any repose except in reading your letters? And they would certainly have been more frequent, had you had anything to say by which you thought that my distress might be relieved. But nevertheless I beg you not to omit writing to tell me whatever occurs; and, if you can't absolutely hate the men who have shown themselves so cruelly hostile to me, yet do rebuke them: not with the view of doing any good, but to make them feel that I am dear to you.

Accordingly, I no longer look forward to hearing even from you, though your letters always contain something that I like to hear. Therefore pray do go on writing, whenever you have a bearer at hand: though I have nothing to say in answer to your last, which nevertheless I received some time ago. For in the now long interval I can see that there has been a general change; that the right cause is strong; that I am being severely punished for my folly. The thirty sestertia which I received from Gnaeus <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> are to be paid to Publius <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a>. Please see that they are paid without delay. I have written on that subject to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>.

XI, 12) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 8 MARCH (EVENING) <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalio</a> delivered me a letter from you in the evening of the 8th of March. Now on the morning of the same day I had already despatched the letter-carriers, to whom I had given a letter for you. However, after reading your letter I thought I must write something in answer, more especially as you show that you are anxious as to what explanation I intend to offer <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of my journey at the time that I left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. I have no need of any new explanation. For I have repeatedly written to him, and have charged various people to tell him, that I was unable, much as I wished it, to stand out against people's talk; and much more to the same effect. For there is nothing I should less like than that be should think that in a matter of such importance I did not act on my independent judgment. I afterwards received a letter from <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> the younger, saying that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> regarded my brother Quintus as having sounded the signal for my retreat — for that was his expression. I was not at the time aware of what Quintus had written about me to many; but he had spoken and acted to my face with great bitterness, in spite of which I yet wrote to <a href=/people/5544 target=_blank>Ceasar</a> in these words: I am no less anxious for my brother Quintus than for myself: but I do not venture in such a position as mine to recommend him to you. Yet this at least I will venture to ask of you — thus much I can do — I beg you not to think that he did anything to diminish the constancy of my service, or lessen my affection to you. Believe rather that he always advised our union; and was the companion, not the leader, of my journey. Wherefore in other matters pray give him all the credit that your own kindness and your mutual friendship demand. I earnestly and repeatedly entreat you not to let me stand in his light with you. Wherefore if I ever do meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — though I have no doubt of his being lenient to Quintus, and that he has already made his intention clear — I after all shall be consistent with myself. But, as far as I can see, my anxiety must be much more in regard to Africa, which, in fact, you say is growing daily stronger, though rather in a way to make one hope for conditions of peace than victory. Would to heaven it were so! But my view of the facts is far different, and I think that you yourself agree with me, but write in a different sense, not to deceive but to encourage me, especially now that Spain is also joined to Africa. You advise me to write to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and the rest. If you think anything of the sort necessary, please do as you have often done: for nothing occurs to me as needing to be written. You have been told that I am in better spirits — what can you think when you see added to my other causes of uneasiness these fine doings of my son-in-law. However, don't cease doing what you can in that direction-namely,, writing to me, even if you have nothing to write about. For a letter from you always conveys something to me. I have accepted the inheritance of Galeo. I presume the form of acceptance was simple, as none has been sent me. 114 </p>                        </div>

XI, 13) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM (APRIL) I have not received anything by way of a letter as yet from Muraena's freedman. Publius Siser delivered the one which I am now answering. You mention a letter from the elder <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>; also you say that certain persons announce the arrival of Quintus in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> — neither is true. You want to know how the several persons who have arrived here are or have been disposed towards me: I have not found any of them ill-disposed; but I know, of course, that you are alive to the importance of this fact to me. For myself, while the whole position is intolerably painful, nothing is more so than the fact that what I have always wished not to happen now appears the only thing for my security. They say that the elder Publius <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a>, the younger at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, and it is certain that Gaius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> has left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. Quintus writes to me to apologize in language much more irritating than when he was accusing me most violently. For he says that he understands from your letter that you disapprove of his having written to many persons with severity about me, and that therefore he is sorry for having hurt your feelings, but that he had done so on good grounds. Then he sets down — but in most indecent terms — the reasons for his having so acted. But neither at the present juncture, nor before, would he have betrayed his hatred for me, had he not seen that I was a ruined man. And oh that I had come nearer to you, even if I had made the journeys by night, as you suggested! As it is, I cannot conceive either where or when I am likely to see you. As to my co-heirs to the property of <a href=/people/4532 target=_blank>Fufidius</a>, there was no occasion for you to write to me: for their demand is in itself equitable, and whatever arrangement you had made I should have regarded as right and proper. As to the repurchase of the property at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416134UFru class=place long=13.3519 lat=41.6402>Frusino</a>, you have for some time past been acquainted with my wishes. Although my affairs were then in a better position, and I was not expecting such a desperate situation, I am nevertheless in the same mind. Please see how it may be brought about. And I beg you to consider, to the best of your ability, whence I may raise the necessary funds. Such means as I had I transferred to <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> at a time when it seemed a prudent thing to do. At that time, therefore, I took up money from your steward as well as borrowing from other sources; the time when Quintus writes to complain that I never gave him a farthing — I who was never asked for it by him, or had myself set eyes on the money. But pray see what can be scraped together, and what advice you would give on all points. You know the ins and outs of it. <a href=/people/1975 target=_blank>Grief</a> prevents my writing more. If there is anything you think ought to be written to anybody in my name, pray do as usual: and whenever you find anybody to whom you can intrust a letter for me, I beg you not to omit doing so.

XI, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM (APRIL) The candour of your letter does not offend me, because you do not endeavour even tentatively to console me, as was your wont, under the weight of public and personal misfortunes, but acknowledge that that is now impossible. For things are not even as they were before, when, if nothing else, I thought that I had comrades and partners in my policy. For now all the petitioners in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a> and in Asia also, who have received no pardon, and even those who have, are said to be about to sail into Africa. So I have no one now except <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> to share my error: and even he is in a better position than I am in that he has been received back. But about myself I have no doubt <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has written to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and to <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, by whom, if they had had anything pleasant to report, I should have been informed, and they would have spoken to you. Pray have some talk with them on this point, and write me word of their answer not that any security granted by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is likely to have any certainty, still one will be able to consider things and make some provision for the future. Though I shun the sight of all, especially with such a son-in-law as mine, yet in such a state of misery I can't think of anything else to wish. Quintus is going on in the old way, as both <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> and <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> have written to tell me — and he is also said to be making for Africa with the rest. I will write to <a href=/people/427 target=_blank>Minucius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=place long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentum</a> and send him your letter: I will write and tell you if I come to any settlement. I should have been surprised at your being able to find thirty sestertia, had there not been a good surplus from the sale of the Fufidian estates. But my eager desire now is for yourself, to see whom, if it is in any way possible (and circumstances make it desirable), I am very anxious. The last act is being played: what its nature is it is easy to estimate at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, more difficult here. 123 </p>                        </div>

XI, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 14 MAY: As you give me good and sufficient reasons why I cannot see you at this time, I beg you to tell me what I ought to do. For it seems to me that, though <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> is holding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, he is ashamed even to send a despatch on the operations there. Whereas these men in Africa seem to be on the point of coming over here: so, too, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=demonym long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaean</a> refugees seem to intend returning from Asia to join them, or to stay in some neutral place. What therefore do you think I ought to do? I quite see that it is difficult to advise. For I am the only one (or with one other ) for whom neither a return to the one party is possible, nor a gleam of hope visible from the other. But nevertheless I should like to know what your opinion is, and that was the reason among others why I wished to see you, if it could be managed. I wrote before to tell you that <a href=/people/427 target=_blank>Minucius</a> had only paid twelve sestertia: please see that the balance is provided. Quintus wrote to me not only without any strong appeal for pardon, but in the most bitter style, while his son did so with astonishing malignity. No sorrow can be imagined with which I am not crushed. Yet everything is more bearable than the pain caused by my error: that is supreme and abiding. If I were destined to have the partners in that error that I expected, it would nevertheless be but a poor consolation. But the case of all the rest admits of some escape, mine of none. Some because they were taken prisoners, others because their way was barred, avoid having their loyalty called in question, all the more so, of course, now that they have extricated themselves and joined forces again. Why, even the very men who of their own free will went to <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> can merely be counted wanting in courage. Finally, there are many who will be taken back, in whatever way they return to that party. So you ought to be the less astonished that I cannot hold up against such violent grief. For I am the only one whose error cannot be repaired, except perhaps <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a> — but what alleviation is that to me? — for they say that even Gaius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> has changed his mind about going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. I write this to you, not that you may be able to remove my anxiety, but to know whether you have any suggestion to make in regard to the distresses that are sapping my strength, to which are now added my son-in-law, and the rest that I am prevented by my tears from writing. Nay, even <a href=/people/80 target=_blank>Aesop</a>'s son wrings my heart. There is absolutely nothing wanting to make me the most unhappy of men. But to return to my first question — what do you think I ought to do? Should I remove secretly to some place nearer <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, or should I cross the sea? For remaining here much longer is out of the question. Why could no settlement he come to about the property of <a href=/people/4532 target=_blank>Fufidius</a>? For the arrangement was one about which there is not usually any dispute, when the portion which is thought of the less value can be made up by putting the property up to auction among the heirs. I have a motive for asking the question: for I suspect that my co-heirs think that my position is doubtful, and therefore prefer allowing the matter to remain unsettled.

XI, 16) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 3 JUNE: IT is by no fault of mine this time — for I did commit an error formerly — that the letter you forward brings me no consolation. For it is written in a grudging spirit, and gives rise to strong suspicions of not really being from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, suspicions which I think have occurred to yourself. About going to meet him I will do as you advise. The fact is that there is no belief prevalent as to his coming, nor do those who arrive from Asia say that anything has been heard about a peace, the hope of which caused me to fall into this trap. I see no reason for entertaining hopes, especially in the present circumstances, when such disaster has been sustained in Asia, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll class=place long=19.8 lat=40.8>Illyricum</a>, in the <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> affair, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> itself, in the city, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. In my opinion, even if he is going to return (he is said to be still engaged in war) the business will be all settled before his return. You say that a certain feeling of exultation on the part of the loyalists was roused on hearing of the receipt of this letter: you of course omit nothing in which you think that there is any consolation; but I cannot be induced to believe that any loyalist could think that any salvation has been of such value in my eyes, as to make me ask it of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> — much less should I be likely to do so now that I have not a single partner even in this policy. Those in Asia are waiting to see how things turn out. Those in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a> also keep dangling before <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a> the hope that they will petition for pardon. These men had at first the same reason for fear as I had, and the same policy. The check at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> has improved their position, it has ruined mine. Wherefore I now make the same request to you as in my previous letter, that, if you can see in the midst of this desperate state of things what you think I ought to do, you would tell me of it. Supposing me to be received back by this party, which you see is not the case, yet, as long as there is war, I cannot think what to do or where to stay: still less, if I am rejected by them. Accordingly, I am anxious for a letter from you, and beg you to write to me without hesitation. You advise me to write to Quintus about this letter of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s: I would have done so, if it had been in any way one agreeable to me; although I have received a letter from a certain person in these words: Considering the evil state of things, I am pretty comfortable at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a>: I should be still more so, if your brother spoke of you in terms suited to my feelings. You say that Quintus writes you word that I never answer his letters. I have only had one from him; to that I gave an answer to <a href=/people/4475 target=_blank>Cephalio</a>, who, however, was kept back several months by bad weather. I have already told you that the young Quintus has written to me in the most offensive terms. The last thing I have to say is to beg you, if you think it a right thing to do and what you can undertake, to communicate with <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a> and make a joint representation to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> about making a will. The state of the times is a warning to her to take measures for satisfying all just claims upon her. <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> tells me that she is acting in an unprincipled way. I can scarcely believe it, but at any rate, if there is anything that can be done, measures should be taken in time. Pray write to me on every sort of subject, and especially what you think about her, in regard to whom I need your advice, even though you fail to hit upon any plan: I shall take that to mean that the case is desperate. 3 June. </p>                        </div>

My daughter <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> reached me on the 12th of June, and expatiated at great length on your attention and kindness to her, and gave me three letters. I, however, have not got the pleasure from her own virtue, gentleness, and affection which I ought to get from a matchless daughter, but have even been overwhelmed with extraordinary sorrow, to think that a character like hers should be involved in circumstances of such distress, and that that should occur from no fault of hers, but from my own consummate folly. Accordingly, I am not expecting from you now either consolation, which I see you desire to offer, or advice, which is impossible of adoption; and I understand on many occasions from your previous, as well as from your last letters, that you have tried everything practicable. I am thinking of sending my son with <a href=/people/248 target=_blank>Sallustius</a> to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. As for <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>, I see no motive for keeping her with me any longer in such a sad state of mutual sorrow. Accordingly, I am going to send her back to her mother as Soon as she will herself consent to go. In return for the letter which you wrote in the consolatory style, pray consider that I have made the only answer which you will yourself understand to have been possible. You say that <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> has had some talk with you: what he said does not at all disagree with my suspicion about it. But I have no doubt that it would be impossible to persuade that party that their proceedings could have my approval, whatever language I were to hold. However, I will be as moderate as I can. Although what it should matter to me that I incur their odium I don't understand. I perceive that you are prevented by a good reason from coming to see us, and that is a matter of great regret to me. There is no news of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> having left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>; but all agree that no one has come from there either since the 15th of March, and that he has written no letters since the 13th of December. This shows you that there was nothing genuine about that letter of the 9th of February — which would have been quite unimportant, even if it had been genuine. I am informed that L. <a href=/people/217 target=_blank>Terentius</a> has left Africa and come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404150PPos class=place long=15.0056 lat=40.4229>Paestum</a>. What his mission is, or how he got out of the country, or what is going on in Africa, I should like to know. For he is said to have been passed out by means of <a href=/people/5820 target=_blank>Nasidius</a>. What it all means pray write me word if you discover it. I will do as you say about the ten sestertia. Good-bye. 14 June. </p>                        </div>

I expect nothing at all now that is not unhappy. But nothing can be more abominable than the place in which I now am. Wherefore I would like you to speak both to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> and to the Caesarians with you, and get the matter through for me as well as you can, and write to me on all subjects as soon as possible.

XI, 25) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 5 JULY: I have no difficulty in agreeing with your letter, in which you point out at considerable length that there is no advice by which I can be aided by you. At least there is no consolation capable of relieving my sorrow. For nothing has been brought upon me by chance — for that would have been endurable — but I have created it all by those mistakes and miserable conditions of mind and body, to which I only wish those nearest and dearest to me had preferred to apply remedies! Therefore, since I have no ray of hope either of advice from you or of any consolation, I will not ask you for them in future. I would only ask one thing of you — that you should not omit writing to me whatever comes into your mind, whenever you have anyone to whom you can give a letter, and as long as there shall be anyone to whom to write, which won't be very long. There is a rumour of a doubtful sort that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has quitted <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>. It arose from a letter from <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, which all subsequent messengers have confirmed. Since it makes no difference to me, I don't know whether I should prefer this news being true or false. As to what I said some time ago to you about <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>'s will, I should like it preserved in the custody of the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestals</a>. I am worn out and harassed to death by the folly of this most unhappy girl. I don't think there was ever such a creature born. If any measure of mine can do her any good, I should like you to tell me of it. I can see that you will have the same difficulty as you had before in giving me advice — but this is a matter that causes me more anxiety than everything else. I was blind to pay the second instalment. I wish I had done otherwise: but that's past and done with. I beg of you that, considering the ruinous state of affairs, if any money can be collected or got together and put in safe hands, from sale of plate and the fairly abundant furniture, you would take steps to do so. For I think that the worst is hard upon us, that there will be no making of peace, and that the present regime will collapse even without an opponent. Speak to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> also on this subject, if you think it right, at some convenient opportunity. I can't write all I have to say.

XI, 23) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 9 JULY: On the subject on which I wrote to ask you to consult with <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>, he has himself written to say that you have spoken to him. I am waiting for a letter from you — but I do not see how it can be changed if it is other than it should be. But having received a letter from him, I wanted one from you, though I think that you have not been informed on the subject I only hope that you are well! For you mentioned that you were suffering from a sort of illness. A certain <a href=/people/7190 target=_blank>Agusius</a> arrived from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> on the 8th of July. He brings word that young Quintus started to join <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> on the 29th of May, that <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364282IRho class=place long=28.2244 lat=36.4408>Rhodes</a> on the day previous, and had a letter for me. You will hear what <a href=/people/7190 target=_blank>Agusius</a> himself has to say: but he is travelling rather slowly. Therefore I have contrived to give this to some one who goes quickly. I don't know what that letter Contains, but my brother Quintus offers me cordial congratulations. For my part, considering my egregious blunder, I cannot even imagine anything happening that can be endurable to me. I beg you to think about my poor girl, and about what I wrote to you in my last — that some money should be got together to avert destitution, and about the will itself. The other thing also I could have wished that I had done before, but I was afraid of taking any step. The best alternative in a very bad business was a divorce. I should then have behaved something like a man — on the ground either of his proposals for abolition of debts, or his night assaults on houses, or his relations with <a href=/people/2333 target=_blank>Metella</a>, or his ill conduct generally: and then I should not have lost the money, and should have shown myself to possess some manly indignation. I quite remember your letter, but I also remember the circumstance of the time: yet anything would have been better. As it is, indeed, he seems to intend to divorce her: for I am told about the statue of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. To think that a son-in-law of mine, of all people in the world, should do that, or propose the abolition of debts! I am of opinion, therefore, and so are you, that a notice of divorce should be sent by her. He will perhaps claim the third instalment. Consider, therefore, whether the divorce should be allowed to originate with him, or whether we should anticipate him. If I can do so by any means, even by travelling at night, I will try to see you. Meanwhile, pray write to me about these matters, and anything else which it may be my interest to know. Good-bye. </p>                        </div>

You yourself write to me more rarely than you used, and more briefly: I suppose because you have nothing to say which you suppose that I can read or hear with pleasure. But indeed I would have you write, whatever and of what kind soever it may be. The fact is that there is only one thing capable of exciting a wish in me — the chance of negociation for peace: and of that I have absolutely no hope.

XI, 24) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 6 AUGUST: What you said some time ago in a letter to me, and about me to <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> — with a view of its reaching me also — feel to be true. It adds to my misery, though I thought no addition possible, that, when most flagrantly wronged, I cannot with impunity show, not only any anger, but even vexation. Let me, therefore, put up with that. But when I have swallowed it, I shall yet have to endure the very things which you warn me to be on my guard against. For the blunder I have committed is such, that, whatever the final settlement and the sentiments of the people may be, its result seems likely to be the same. Here I take the pen into my own hands; for what follows must be treated more confidentially. See, I beg you, even now to the will, which was made at the time when she began to be in difficulties. She did not trouble you, for she never asked you even a question, nor me either. But assuming this to be the case, you will be able — as you have now got to the point of speaking about it — to suggest to her to deposit it with some one, whose position is not affected by the result of this war. For my part, I should prefer you to everybody, if she agreed in wishing it. But the fact is, I keep the poor woman in the dark as to this particular fear of mine. 149About my other suggestion, I know, of course, that nothing can be sold at present: but they might be stowed away and concealed, so as to be out of reach of the impending crash. For as to what you say about my fortune and yours being at <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a>'s service — I have no doubt as to yours, but what can there be of mine? Again, about <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> — I omit innumerable other points — what can go beyond this? You wrote to her to send me a bill of twelve sestertia, saying that that was the balance of the money. She sent me ten, with a note declaring that to be the balance. When she has deducted such a petty sum from so trifling a total, you can feel pretty sure what she has done in the case of a very large transaction. <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> not only does not come himself, but does not inform me even by letter or messenger what he has done. People coming from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph class=place long=27.3397 lat=37.9419>Ephesus</a> bring word that they saw him there going into court on some private suits of his own, which are themselves perhaps — for so it seems likely — being postponed till the arrival of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Accordingly, I presume either that he has nothing which he considers that there need be any hurry about conveying to me, or that I am such an object of contempt in my misfortunes, that, even if he has anything, he does not trouble himself about conveying it until he has settled all his own concerns. This annoys me very much, but not so much as I think it ought. For I consider that nothing matters less to me than the nature of any communication from that quarter. I feel sure you understand why I say that. You advise me to accommodate my looks and words to the circumstances of the time. It is difficult to do so, yet I would have put that restraint upon myself, had I thought that it was of any importance to me. You say that you think that the African affair may be patched up. I wish you had told me why you think so: for my part, nothing occurs to my mind to make me think it possible. However, pray write and tell me if there is anything to suggest any consolation: but if, as I am clear, there is nothing of that nature, write and tell me even that fact. I, on my side, will write you word of anything which reaches me first. Good-bye. 6 August. </p>                        </div>

I should have been more rejoiced at this if the concessions to myself conveyed any certainty of hope. But, in the first place, there are others, and among them Quintus, father and son, from whom I have reason to entertain other fears; and, in the next place, grants made by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself as absolute master are again within his power to revoke.

Though it was impossible for you not to send me that letter, yet I should have preferred that it had not been sent. In regard to what you say about the will, please consider what should be done and how. In regard to the money, she has herself written in the sense of my previous letter to you, and, if it is necessary, I will draw on the sum you mention. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> does not seem likely to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> by the 1st of September. Many things are said to detain him in Asia, 'above all <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>. The 12th legion, which <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a> visited first, is said to have driven him off with a shower of stones. It is thought that none of the legions will stir. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, people think, will go straight to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a> But if that is so, he must necessarily come here. Yet I should have preferred his going from there; for in that case I should have got away somehow or other. As it is, I fear I must wait for him, and, among other misfortunes, my poor <a href=/people/1030 target=_blank>Tullia</a> must also endure the unhealthy climate of the place. You advise me to make my actions square with the time: I would have done so, had circumstances allowed of it, and had it been in any way possible. But in view of the prodigious blunders made by myself, and the wrongs inflicted upon me by my relations, there is no possibility of doing anything or keeping up any pretext worthy of my character. You compare the Sullan period: but, if we regard the principle of that movement, it was everything that was most eminent; where it failed was in a want of moderation in its execution. The present movement, on the other hand, is of such a character, that I forget my own position, and much prefer the general advantage to that of the party, with whose interests I have identified my own. Nevertheless pray write to me as often as possible, and the more so that no one else writes; and yet, if everybody did, I should still look forward to your letters most. You say that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> will be more kindly disposed to Quintus thanks to me: I have already told you that he at once granted everything to the younger Quintus and said never a word about me.

I say this because I have a letter from you in which you seem to fear that I have not received those letters, which in fact I could wish had never been delivered to me. For they increased my misery, and, if they had fallen into anyone else's hands, they would not have inflicted any fresh harm upon me. For what can be more universally notorious than his rage against me and the sort of letter he writes?-a kind of letter which even <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> appears to have sent to his friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, not because he was shocked at his unprincipled conduct, but, I believe, to make my miserable position better known. You say that you are afraid that they will do Quintus harm, and that you are trying to remedy the mischief. Why! <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> did not even wait to be asked about him. I don't mind that; but what I mind more is that the favours granted to myself have no stability. <a href=/people/39 target=_blank>Sulla</a>, I believe, will be here tomorrow with <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>. They are hurrying to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> after being driven away by the soldiers, who say that they will go nowhere until they' have got what was promised them. Therefore he will come here, though slowly: for, though he is keeping on the move, he devotes many days to the several towns. Moreover, <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>, whatever course he takes, must cause him delay. What, then, do you think I should do? For by this time I am scarcely strong enough physically to endure the unhealthiness of this climate, because it adds bodily suffering to mental pain.

So then she is still completely uncommitted; for so you say in your letter.

So listen to what I say in all plainness and sincerity. May I perish, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, if, I don't say my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa — where in other respects I am very happy — but even the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000GEly class=place long=23.73603 lat=37.96393>islands of the blest</a> are in my eyes worth an absence of so many days from you. Wherefore let us harden ourselves to endure these three days-assuming you to be in the same state of feeling as myself, which is surely the case. But I should like to know whether you are coming today immediately after the auction, or on what day. Meanwhile I am busy with my books, and am much inconvenienced by not having <a href=/people/5311 target=_blank>Vennonius</a>'s history. However, not to omit business altogether, that debt which <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> assigned to me admits of being recovered in three ways: first, purchase at the auction — but I would rather lose it, although, let alone the disgrace, that is as good as losing it. Secondly, a bond payable a year hence from the purchaser — but who is there I can trust, and when will that year of <a href=/people/1479 target=_blank>Meton</a> come? Thirdly, accepting half down on the proposal of <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a>. Look into the matter therefore. And indeed I am afraid <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> may now not have the auction at all, but when the games are over will hurry off to the aid of (Q. <a href=/people/12083 target=_blank>Pedius</a>), lest such a great man should be treated with neglect But I will see to it.

Nay, even if I keep clear of his senatorial speeches, and of every wish and purpose which he entertained in politics, and chose in merely general terms to eulogise his firmness and consistency, even this in itself would be no pleasant hearing for your friends. But that great man cannot be praised as he really deserves unless the following topics are dilated upon: his having seen that the present state of things was to occur, his having exerted himself to prevent them, and his having quitted life to avoid seeing what has actually happened. What point is there in these on which I could possibly secure the approval of <a href=/people/5421 target=_blank>Aledius</a>?

Now I come to <a href=/people/2357 target=_blank>Tyrannio</a>. Do you really mean it? Was this fair? Without me? Why, how often, though quite at leisure, did I yet refuse without you? How will you excuse yourself for this? The only way of course is to send me the book; and I beg you earnestly to do so. And yet the book itself will not give me more pleasure than your admiration of it has already done. For I love everyone who loves learning, and I rejoice at your feeling such a great admiration for that essay on a minute point. However, you are that sort of man in everything. You want to know, and that is the only food of the intellect. But pray what did you get that contributed to your summum bonum from that acute and grave essay? However, I am talking too much, and you have been occupied in some business which is perhaps mine: and in return for that dry basking of yours in the sun, of which you took such full advantage on my lawn, I shall ask of you in return some sunshine and a good dinner. But I return to what I was saying. The book, if you love me, send me the book! It is certainly yours to give, since indeed it was dedicated to you. What, <a href=/people/3008 target=_blank>Chremes</a>, Have you such leisure from your own affairs as even to read my 'Orator'? Well done!

I have already written all you want in a note and given it to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, briefly, but even more than you ask. In it I have spoken about my son, of whose idea you gave me the first hint. I said to him in the most liberal manner what I should like you, if it is convenient to you, to learn from his own mouth. But why put it off? I explained to him that you had reported to me his wishes and what means he required: He wished to go to Spain; he wanted a liberal allowance. As to a liberal allowance, I said that he should have as much as Publius gave his son, and the flamen <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> gave his. As to Spain, I put before him two objections, first, the one I mentioned to you, the fear of adverse criticism — Was it not enough that we abandoned the war? Must we even fight on the other side? And secondly, that he would certainly be annoyed at being surpassed by his cousin in intimacy with <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and every kind of favour. I could wish that he would take advantage of my liberality, rather than of his own freedom of action: nevertheless, I gave the permission: for I had been given to understand that you were not much against it. I will think over the subject earnestly, and beg that you will do the same. It is an important step: to stay at home involves no complications, the other course is risky. But we will see. About <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> I had already written in the note, and I think of doing as you suggest as soon as he returns. But if he is somewhat slow in coming, I shall in any case be three days at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: and, oh!

XII, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA (8 MARCH) I wrote to you yesterday about making my excuses to <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a>. I think there is no difficulty. No matter to whom you apply, no one will refuse. But see <a href=/people/1598 target=_blank>Septimius</a>, <a href=/people/2321 target=_blank>Laenas</a>, and <a href=/people/3081 target=_blank>Statilius</a> about it. For three are required. <a href=/people/2321 target=_blank>Laenas</a>, however, undertook the whole business for me. You say that you have been dunned by <a href=/people/514 target=_blank>Iunius</a>: <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a> is certainly a man of substance, yet I should nevertheless like to know when I am said to have given the guarantee, and whether it was for the father or son. None the less pray do as you say, and interview the agents of <a href=/people/966 target=_blank>Cornificius</a> and <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a> the land-dealer. You wish me some relaxation of my mourning: you are kind, as usual, but you can bear me witness that I have not been wanting to myself. For not a word has been written by anyone on the subject of abating grief which I did not read at your house. But my sorrow is too much for any consolation. Nay, I have done what certainly no one ever did before me — tried to console myself by writing a book, which I will send to you as soon as my amanuenses have made copies of it. I assure you that there is no more efficacious consolation. I write all day long, not that I do any good, but for a while I experience a kind of check, or, if not quite that — for the violence of my grief is overpowering-yet I get some relaxation, and I try with all my might to recover composure, not of heart, yet, if possible, of countenance. When doing that I sometimes feel myself to be doing wrong, sometimes that I shall be doing wrong if I don't. Solitude does me some good, but it would have done me more good, if you after all had been here: and that is my only reason for quitting this place, for it does very well in such miserable circumstances. And even this suggests another cause of sorrow. For you will not be able to be to me now what you once were: everything you used to like about me is gone. I wrote to you before about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter to me: it contained a great deal of good sense, but nothing to give me any comfort. As to his asking in his letter to you whether I should like him to come to see me — by all means: he would be sure to give me some help, considering his strong affection for me. If you have any news, pray write and tell me, especially as to when <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> goes. I am sorry about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>: yet I believe in <a href=/people/341 target=_blank>Craterus</a>.

But if any alleviation had been possible, it would have been in you alone, and as soon as it will be possible from anyone, it will be from you.

XII, 18) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA (11 MARCH) To fly from recollections, which make my soul smart as though it were stung, I take refuge in recalling my plans to your memory. Pray pardon me, whatever you think of this one. The fact is that I find that some of the authors, whom I am now continually reading, suggest as a proper thing to do just what I have often discussed with you, and for which I desire your approval. I mean about the shrine-pray think of it as earnestly as your affection for me should suggest. About the design I do not feel any doubt, for I like that of <a href=/people/9161 target=_blank>Cluatius</a>, nor about the building of it at all — for to that I have made up my mind: but about the site I do sometimes hesitate. Pray therefore think over it. To the fullest capacity of such an enlightened age, I am quite resolved to consecrate her memory by every kind of memorial borrowed from the genius of every kind of artist, Greek or Latin. This may perhaps serve to irritate my wound: but I look upon myself as now bound by a kind of vow and promise. And the infinite time during which I shall be non-existent has more influence on me than this brief life, which yet to me seems only too long. For though I have tried every expedient, I find nothing to give me peace of mind. For even when I was composing that essay, of which I wrote to you before, I was in a way nursing my sorrow. Now I reject every consolation, and find nothing more endurable than solitude, which <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> did not, as I feared, disturb. For after calling on me yesterday, he started at once for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. The letter which, in accordance with your advice, I have written to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> I herewith send you. Please see it delivered to him with your own. However, I am sending you a copy of it, in order that, if you disapprove, you should not send it. You say my domestic affairs are being managed properly: please tell me what they are. For there are some points on which I am expecting to hear. See that <a href=/people/2220 target=_blank>Cocceius</a> does not play me false. For <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>'s promise, mentioned by <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> in his letter, I regard as secure. As to my capital, I trust <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>, and, of course, <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a>. About <a href=/people/2716 target=_blank>Appuleius</a> why need you trouble yourself, when my excuse is so easily made? Your coming to me, as you show an intention of doing, may, I fear, be difficult for you. It is a long journey, and when you went away again, which you will perhaps have to do very quickly, I should be unable to let you go without great pain. But all as you choose. Whatever you do will in my eyes be right, and done also in my interest. </p>                        </div>

But perhaps it was written the day before it was sent. It does not matter to me: yet my own idea is that he has hurried back to save his securities. You say that <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> speaks about the witnesses to my will: in the first place, pray believe that I am not paying attention to things of that sort, and that I have no leisure for business which is either unimportant or fresh. Yet, after all, where is the analogy between us? She did not invite as witnesses those whom she thought would ask questions unless they knew the contents of her will. Was that a danger applicable to me? Yet, after all, let her do as I do. I will hand over my will for anyone she may select to read: she will find that nothing could have been in better taste than what I have done about my grandson. As for my not having invited certain witnesses: in the first place, it did not occur to me; and, in the second place, it did not occur to me because it was of no consequence. You know, if you have not forgotten, that I told you at the time to bring some of your friends: what need of a great many was there? For my part, I had bidden members of my household.

I think sometimes of purchasing some pleasure-grounds across the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, and principally for the reason that I don't think that there is any other position so much frequented.

I have nothing to say to you; but in spite of that, I have resolved to write every day, to get a letter out of you. Not that I expect anything definite from your letters, but yet somehow or another I do expect it. Wherefore, whether you have anything or nothing to say, yet write something and — take care of yourself. </p>                        </div>

XII, 21) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA (17 MARCH) I have read <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter, and hereby return it to you. it was not at all a well-informed answer to the criticisms which you had sent him. But that is his affair. Yet it is discreditable that he should be ignorant of this. He thinks that <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> was the first to deliver his speech as to the punishment of the conspirators, whereas everyone except <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had spoken before him. And whereas <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s own speech, delivered from the praetorian bench, was so severe, he imagines that those of the consulars were less so-<a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, <a href=/people/213 target=_blank>Servilius</a>, the <a href=/people/4188 target=_blank>Luculli</a>, <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>, <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>, <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>, <a href=/people/1509 target=_blank>Gellius</a>, <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a>, <a href=/people/2162 target=_blank>Figulus</a>, <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, Lucius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, Gaius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/1243 target=_blank>Glabrio</a>, and even the consuls-designate <a href=/people/816 target=_blank>Silanus</a> and Muraena. Why, then, you may say, was the vote on <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s motion? Because he had expressed the same decision in clearer and fuller words. Our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> again confines his commendation of me to my having brought the matter before the senate, without a word of my having unmasked the plot, of my having urged that measures should be taken, of having made up my mind on the subject before I brought it before the senate. It was because <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> praised these proceedings of mine to the skies, and moved that they should be put on record, that the division took place on his motion. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> again thinks he pays me a high compliment in designating me as the most excellent consul. Why, what opponent ever put it in more niggardly terms? But to your other criticisms what a poor answer! He only asks you to make the correction as to the decree of the senate. He would have done that much even at the suggestion of his copyist. But once more that is his affair. As to the suburban pleasure-grounds, as you approve of them, come to some settlement. You know my means. If, however, we get any more out of <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>, there is no difficulty. But even without him I think I can get along. The pleasure-grounds of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> at least are for sale, perhaps those of <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> also. But this when we meet. About <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> I can say nothing more to the point than you say in your letter. Duty must be my first consideration: if I have made any mistake, I would rather that I had reason to be dissatisfied with her than she with me. A hundred sestertia have to be paid to <a href=/people/6747 target=_blank>Ovia</a>, wife of C. <a href=/people/1887 target=_blank>Lollius</a>. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> says he can't do it without me: I suppose because some land has to pass at a valuation between us. I could wish that he had told you. For if the matter, as he writes, is arranged, and he is not lying on that very point, it could have been settled by your agency. Pray look into and settle the business. You urge me to reappear in the forum: that is a place which I ever avoided even in my happier days. Why, what have I to do with a forum when there are no law courts, no <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>, and when men are always obtruding on my sight whom I cannot see with any patience? You say people call for my presence at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, and are unwilling to allow me to be absent, or at any rate beyond a certain time: I assure you that it is long since I have valued your single self higher than all those people. Nor do I undervalue myself even, and I much prefer abiding by my own judgment than by that of all the rest. Yet, after all, I go no farther than the greatest philosophers think allowable, all whose writings of whatever kind bearing on that point I have not only read — which is itself being a brave invalid and taking one's physic — but have transcribed in my own essay. That at least did not look like a mind crushed and prostrate. From the use of these remedies do not call me back to the crowds of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, lest I have a relapse. </p>                        </div>

For those are precisely the wounds which I cannot touch without a loud groan. Therefore I beg you to make the fairest settlement in your power. Nor do I demand of you anything more than you can do; yet it is you alone who can see what is fair. As to Rutilia, since you seem to be in doubt, please write and tell me when you ascertain the truth, and do so as soon as possible. Also whether <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a> survived her son <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, the ex-consul.

As to the suburban pleasure-grounds, I am particularly urgent with you. I must employ all my own means, and those of men whom I know will not fail to help me: though I shall be able to do it with my own. I have also some property which I could easily sell.

The most readily available are those of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, for he wants to sell. The next I think are those of <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a>; but he is away. Nevertheless, pray scent out anything you can. <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> does not make any use of his either, and he will be very easily satisfied by being paid interest on the purchase money.

XII, 23) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA (19 MARCH) I thought that your letter was going to tell me some news, to judge from the opening sentence, which said that though I did not care about what was going on in Spain, you would yet write and tell me of it: but in point of fact you only answered my remark about the forum and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCJu class=place long=12.48549 lat=41.89296>senate-house</a>. But your town-house, you say, is a forum. What do I want with a town-house itself, if I have no forum? Ruined, ruined, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>! That has been the case for a long while, I know: but it is only now that I confess it, when I have lost the one thing that bound me to life. Accordingly, I seek solitude: and yet, if any necessity does take me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I shall try, if I possibly can — and I know I can — to let no one perceive my grief except you, and not even you if it can by any means be avoided. And, besides, there is this reason for my not coming. You remember the questions <a href=/people/5421 target=_blank>Aledius</a> asked you. If they are so troublesome even now, what do you think they will be, if I come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>? Yes, settle about <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> in the sense of your letter; and relieve me from this addition — though not the heaviest — to my bitter sorrows. To show you that, though in mourning, I am not prostrate, listen to this. You have entered in your Chronicle the consulship in which <a href=/people/711 target=_blank>Carneades</a> and the famous embassy came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I want to know now what the reason of it was. It was about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383238POro class=place long=23.79 lat=38.3195>Oropus</a> I think, but am not certain. And if so, what were the points in dispute? And farther, who was the best known <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> of that time and head of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BGEp class=place long=23.717 lat=37.9847>Garden</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>? Also who were the famous political writers at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>? These facts too, I think, you can ascertain from the book of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a>. I am sorry to hear about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>; but since it is a mild attack, I feel confident of all going well. About Gamala I had no doubt. For why otherwise was his father <a href=/people/5088 target=_blank>Ligus</a> so fortunate? For what could I say of myself, who am incapable of having my grief removed, though all my wishes should be gratified. I had heard of the price put on <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>'s suburban pleasure-grounds, which you mention, and, as I think, it was yesterday that I wrote to you about it: but be the price what it may, what one is obliged to have is a good bargain. In my eyes, whatever you think — for I know what I think of myself — it brings a certain alleviation, if not of sorrow, yet of my sense of solemn obligation. I have written to <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> because he is intimate with L. <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>. If we don't come to terms about pleasure-grounds beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a>, <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> has some at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> in a very frequented situation, though confined as to space. Enough, however, and more than enough for this purpose. Please think the matter over. And don't be afraid of the cost of the pleasure-grounds. I don't want plate, nor rich furniture coverings, nor particular picturesque spots: I want this. I perceive too by whom I can be aided. But speak to <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> about it. There's no better fellow. I have also given <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> a commission. He has written back to say that he has made an appointment with him. He will therefore write and tell me what he has arranged, and then you must see to it. </p>                        </div>

XII, 28) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA (24 MARCH) I have learnt nothing more about <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> from <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> in conversation than I knew from his letter: for he had written in full detail If; therefore, you have an interview with him, write and tell me your views. As to the subject on which you say a message was sent to me, whether it was sent or not I don't know; at any rate not a word has reached me. Pray therefore go on as you have begun, and if you come to any settlement on such terms as to satisfy her — though I, for my part, think it impossible-take my son with you on your visit, if you think it right. It is of some importance to him to seem to have wished to do something to please. I have no interest in it beyond what you know, which I regard as important. You call upon me to resume my old way of life: well, it had long been my practice to bewail the republic, and that I was still doing, though somewhat less violently, for I had something capable of giving me ease. Now I positively pursue the old way of life and old employments; nor do I think that in that matter I ought to care for the opinion of others. My own feeling is more in my eyes than the talk of them all. As to finding consolation for myself in literature, I am content with my amount of success. I have lessened the outward signs of mourning: my sorrow I neither could, nor would have wished to lessen if I could. About <a href=/people/1340 target=_blank>Triarius</a> you rightly interpret my wishes. But take no step unless the family are willing. I love him though he is no more, I am guardian to his children, I am attached to the whole household. As to the business of <a href=/people/2602 target=_blank>Castricius</a>, — if <a href=/people/2602 target=_blank>Castricius</a> will accept a sum for the slaves, and that at the present value of money, certainly nothing could be more advantageous. But if it has come to the point of his taking the slaves themselves away, I don't think it is fair, as you ask me to tell you what I really think: for I don't want my brother Quintus to have any trouble, and in that I think I have gathered that you agree with me. If <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a> is waiting for the aequinox — as you say that <a href=/people/5421 target=_blank>Aledius</a> tells you — I think he must be on the point of sailing. He told me, however, that he was going by way of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. Which of the two it is, and when, I should like to know. And I should like you some time or other, when convenient to yourself, to see young <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, and assign to his service such of the slaves as you may think right. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. </p>                        </div>

Tomorrow therefore, or rather as soon as you can, you will write and tell me, if there is anything to tell after you have seen him. I neither avoid <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, nor after all expect any consolation from him. But there are reasons for my not wishing to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at the present juncture; and if those reasons remain in force, I must find some excuse with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, and as at present advised they seem likely to remain in force. About the suburban pleasure-grounds do, I beseech you, come to some conclusion. The main point is what you know it to be. Another thing is that I want something of the sort for myself: for I cannot exist in a crowd, nor yet remain away from you. For this plan of mine I find nothing more suitable than the spot you mention, and on that matter pray tell me what you advise. I am quite convinced — and the more so because I perceive that you think the same — that I am regarded with warm affection by <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> and <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. Inform them how strongly and for what reason I wish to have suburban pleasure-grounds, and that it is only possible if the business of <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a> is settled; and ask them therefore whether they will promise the future payment. Even if I must sustain some loss in taking ready money, induce them to go as far as they can in the matter — for payment in full is hopeless. You will discover, in fact, whether they are at all disposed to assist my design. If they are so, it is a great help; if not, let us push on in any way we can. Look upon it — as you say in your letter — as a solace for my old age, or as a pro-vision for my grave. The property at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418123UOst class=place long=12.2914 lat=41.7559>Ostia</a> is not to be thought of. If we can't get this one — and I don't think <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> will sell — we must try that of <a href=/people/2568 target=_blank>Damasippus</a>. </p>                        </div>

I think too that the negotiation should be pressed. For I don't see any possibility of coming to terms with <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a>. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>.

Publilia has written to tell me that her mother, on the advice 'of <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a>, is coming to see me with him and that she will come with them if I will allow it: she begs me in many words of intreaty that she may be allowed to do so, and that I would answer her letter. You see what an unpleasant business it is. I wrote back to say that it would be even more painful than it was when I told her that I wished to be alone, and that therefore I did not wish her to come to see me at this time. I thought that, if I made no answer, she would come with her mother: now I don't think she will. For it is evident that her letter is not her own composition. Now this is the very thing I wish to avoid, which I see will occur-namely, that they will come to my house: and the one way of avoiding it is to fly away. I would rather not, but I must. I beg you to find out the last day I can remain here without being caught. Act, as you say, with moderation. I would have you propose to my son, that is, if you think it fair, to adapt the expenses of this sojourn abroad to what he would have been quite content with, if; as he thought of doing, he had remained at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and hired a house — I mean to the rents of my property in the <a href=/people/4077 target=_blank>Argiletum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125LAve class=place long=12.4792 lat=41.8835>Aventine</a> And in making that proposal to him, pray arrange the rest of the business for our supplying him with what he needs from those rents.

Therefore, please investigate who the tenants are and what their rent is, and take care that the tenant is a man to pay to the day. See also what journey money and outfit will suffice. There is Certainly no need of a carriage and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>.

Accordingly, I am more surprised at your saying that you think he will sell, if we would include something else which he is anxious to get rid of, as he had of his own accord determined not to do so. You ask me to fix my maximum price and to say how muck I prefer those pleasure grounds of <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>. I have never set foot in them. I know <a href=/people/2856 target=_blank>Coponius</a>'s villa to be old and not very spacious, the wood a fine one, but I don't know what either brings in, and that after all I think we ought to know.

I am anxious to avoid any likeness to a tomb, not so much on account of the penalty of the law as in order to attain as nearly as possible to an apotheosis. This I could do if I built it in the villa itself, but, as we often observed to each other, I dread the changes of owners. Wherever I constructed it on the land, I think I could secure that posterity should respect its sanctity. These foolish ideas of mine — for I confess them to be so-you must put up with: for I don't feel such confidence in taking even myself into my own confidence as I do in taking you.

Therefore, before you leave town, I should much like you to call on <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, if he is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. If it comes to nothing, I shall succeed in making you angry with me, however accustomed you are to putting up with my folly. For <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> at least is willing to sell. So, even if nothing else turns up, it will be my own fault if I don't buy. Pray take care that I don't make a mistake in this business. The only way of making certain of that is our being able to get some of Scapula's land. Also let me know how long you intend being in your suburban villa. With <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> I need your power of conciliation as well as your influence. But do as you think right. For I know that whatever is to my interest is a subject of more anxiety to you than to myself. </p>                        </div>

By this time, unless anything has happened to detain you, I suspect that you are in your suburban villa. But I am here, writing from one day's end to another without getting any relief, though I do at any rate distract my thoughts. <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a> has written to me about my infamous relation.

I should have been much annoyed, if there had been room in my heart for any new sorrow. Yet, could there be anything more blackguardly? What a dangerous fellow!

I believe, if they are only reasonable men, they would think, if I am so far recovered as to bring a disengaged mind to writing on difficult subjects, that I am not open to their criticism; or if I have selected a diversion from sorrow in the highest degree noble and worthy of a scholar, that I even deserve to be praised. But though I do everything I can to relieve my sorrow, pray bring to a conclusion what I see that you are as much concerned about as I am myself. I regard this as a debt, the burden of which cannot be lightened unless I pay it, or see a possibility of paying it, that is, unless I find a site such as I wish. If Scapula's heirs, as you say that <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> told you, think of cutting up the pleasure-grounds into four lots, and bidding for them between themselves, there is of course no room for a purchaser. But if they are to come into the market we will see what can be done. For that ground once belonging to <a href=/people/3950 target=_blank>Publicius</a>, and now to <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> and <a href=/people/9216 target=_blank>Cusinius</a>, has been suggested to me. But you know it is a town building site. I don't like it at all. <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>'s I like very much, but I don't think they are for sale. As to <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>'s pleasure-grounds, though you say that you dislike them, I shall take refuge in them after all, unless you find something. I don't mind the building, for I shall build nothing that I should not build even if I don't have them. <a href=/people/27 target=_blank>Cyrus</a>, books IV and V pleased me about as much as the other works of <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a> — a man of acuteness rather than of learning. </p>                        </div>

Yet, after all, I was expecting to hear something from you about <a href=/people/11078 target=_blank>Asinius Pollio</a>'s letter. But I am too apt to judge of your leisure by my own. However, if nothing imperative occurs, I absolve you from the necessity of writing, unless you are quite at leisure. About the letter-carriers I would have done as you suggest, had there been any letters positively necessary, as there were some time ago, when, though the days were shorter, the carriers nevertheless arrived every day up to time, and there was something to say-about <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a>, <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, and certain other things. At present, if <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> had not cropped up, there would have been nothing to write about: and even that has been deferred.

XII, 40) TO ATTICUS (IN HIS SUBURBAN VILLA) ASTURA (9 MAY) What the nature of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s invective in answer to my panegyric is likely to be, I have seen clearly from the book, which <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> has sent me, in which he collects <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s faults, but combined with very warm praise of myself. Accordingly, I have sent the book to Musca with directions to give it to your copyists. As I wish it to be made public: to facilitate that please give orders to your men. I often try my hand at an essay of advice. I can't hit upon anything to say: and yet I have by me <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> and <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a> to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. But where is the analogy? They were writing what was at once honourable to themselves and acceptable to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>. Can you find any similar circumstance in my case? For my part nothing occurs to me. You say in your letter that you fear that both our popularity and influence will suffer by such mourning as mine. I don't know what people object to or expect. That I should not grieve? How can that be? That I should not be prostrated? Who was ever less so? While I was finding consolation in your house, who was ever refused admittance to me? Who ever came to see me who felt any awkwardness? I came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414128UAst class=place long=12.7653 lat=41.4089>Astura</a> from your house. Those cheerful friends of yours who find fault with me cannot read as much as I have written. Well or ill is not the question: but the substance of my writings was such as no one could have composed who was broken down in spirit. I have been thirty days in your suburban villa. Who ever failed to find me at home or reluctant to converse? At this very moment the amount of my reading and writing is such that my people find a holiday more laborious than I do working days. If anyone wants to know why I am not at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, — because it is the vacation. Or why I am not staying at the humble places of mine on this coast, which are now in season, — because I should have been annoyed by the crowd of visitors there. I am therefore staying at the place, where the man who considered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a> the queen of watering-places used year after year to spend this part of the season. When I come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I will give no cause for unfavourable remark either by my look or my conversation. That cheerfulness by which I used to temper the sadness of the situation I have lost for ever; but firmness and fortitude either of heart or speech will not be found wanting. As to Scapula's pleasure-grounds, it seems possible that as a favour, partly to you and partly to me, we might secure their being put up to auction. Unless that is done, we shall be cut out. But if we come to a public auction, we shall outbid <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>'s means by our eagerness. For as to what you say about <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a>, he is not solvent. If only the Faberian business is certain, and you are making an effort, as I am sure you are doing, we shall get what we want. You ask how long I am staying on here. Only a few days: but I am not certain. As soon as I have settled, I will write to you: and write to me yourself, and tell me how long you intend to be in your suburban villa. The day on which I am sending this to you, I have the same news as you give me about <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, both by letter and messenger. </p>                        </div>

On the 10th of the month, indeed, I think you must be out of town and quite see that you have no news to give. However, I shall continue sending you a letter nearly every day. For I prefer writing for nothing to your not having a carrier at hand to whom to give a letter, if anything does turn up which you think I ought to know. Accordingly, I have received on the 10th your letter with its dearth of news. For what was there for you to send? To me however that was not unpleasing, whatever it contained, even if I learnt nothing else but that you had nothing to tell me. Yet, after all, you did say something-about <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>. Where then is she, and when does she arrive?

I don't say unless it is built, but unless I see it being built — I venture to say this much, and you will take it as you ever do words of mine — my vexation will redound upon you, not that you deserve that it should do so; but you will have to endure what I say, as you endure and always have endured everything that affects me. Pray concentrate all your methods of consoling me upon this one thing. If you want to know my wishes, they are these: first Scapula's, second <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>'s; then, if <a href=/people/1117 target=_blank>Silius</a> refuses and <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a> does not behave fairly, the property of <a href=/people/9216 target=_blank>Cusinius</a> and <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a>.

Pray bring this business to a conclusion in any case, if you wish me to feel consoled. You are already finding fault with me in somewhat severer terms than is customary with you; but you do so with the utmost affection, and perhaps tired out by my weakness. Yet all the same, if you wish me to be consoled, this is the very greatest of consolations and, if you would know the truth, the only one. If you have read <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>'s letter, which appears to me to be a kind of first sketch of the invective which <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> has composed against <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, please let me know, when you can conveniently do so, what you think of it.

It is a sufficient proof of how keenly desirous I am for it, that I venture to confess it to you, though I think you do not approve of it so very warmly. But you must put up with my aberration in this matter. Put up with it, do I say? Nay, you must even assist it. About <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> I feel uncertain: perhaps because I am eager for it. But after all the property is beyond my means, especially with a competitor in the field anxious to purchase, rich, and one of the heirs. The next to my taste is <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>'s. But if that can't be secured, make any bargain you please. I regard myself as under a more sacred obligation than anyone ever was to any vow. See also about the pleasure-grounds of <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a>, though the owners are away. But, as I said yesterday, please also consider the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> suggestion, lest the summer slip away.

His book which he sent me about <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> I wish to be published by your copyists, to enhance <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>'s reputation from the nature of their invectives.

Therefore make some bargain or other. Why, what else is wanted except an opening for a purchaser? And that could be secured by means of any one of the heirs. But I think <a href=/people/4221 target=_blank>Mustela</a> will accomplish that, if you ask him. For myself, you will have secured for me not only a site for the purpose I have at heart, but also a solace for my old age.

If neither of them comes off; we must try and outwit <a href=/people/267 target=_blank>Drusus</a>, or have recourse to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> site. You have acted prudently in shutting yourself in your house. But pray finish off your business and let me find you once more at leisure. I leave this place for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, as I told you, on the 16th. Next day I shall be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. For I have well disciplined my feelings, and perhaps conquered them, if only I keep to it. You shall know, therefore, perhaps tomorrow, at the latest the day after. But what does this mean, pray? <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> reports that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> is not invested at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362000UCar class=place long=-5.4104 lat=36.1832>Carteia</a>, and that a serious war remains to be fought. <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> and <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> had sent me a copy of a letter written to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/454119UPat class=person long=11.8766 lat=45.4096>Patavium</a> on this investment, saying that they thought it was so. It is just like <a href=/people/1055 target=_blank>Philotimus</a> to act the second-rate Fulvinius. Nevertheless, tell me anything you know. About the shipwreck of <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> also I want to know the truth. While here I have finished two long treatises. It was the only way I had to give my unhappiness the slip, if I may use the expression. As for you, even if you have nothing to tell, as I foresee will be the case, still write to say that you have nothing to say — so long as you don't use these exact words. </p>                        </div>

Yesterday, not much after you left my house, I think, some men from the city, as they seemed, brought me a message and a letter from Gaius <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, son of Gaius, grandson of Gaius, written at great length: they begged me in the name of our relationship to them, in the name of the famous <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> on whom I had composed a poem, in the name of the eloquence of his grandfather L. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, to undertake his defence, — he then stated his case in full detail.

Now you will detect whether they really approve or only pretend to do so. Pretence will in my eyes be equivalent to rejection. You must probe that question. Tiro told me what you thought ought to be done about <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a>: that it was unbecoming to me to be in debt; that you were in favour of an assignment: Fear this and not the other? passing strange!

XIII, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM, 23 MAY: In your letter to my son you spoke with a serious gravity, and yet with a moderation which nothing could surpass. It is exactly what I should have wished. Your letters to the Tullii also are extremely wise. So either these letters will fulfil their object or we must think of other measures. As to money moreover I perceive that you are making every effort or rather have done so. If you succeed, I shall owe the suburban pleasure-grounds to you. There is indeed no other kind of property that I should prefer, principally of course for the purpose which I have resolved to carry out. And in regard to this you relieve my impatience by your promise, or rather your undertaking as to this summer. In the second place, there is nothing that can possibly be better adapted for my declining years and for an alleviation of my melancholy. My eagerness for this drives me at times to wish to spur you on. But I suppress the impulse: for I have no doubt that, when you know me to be very much set on a thing, your eagerness will surpass my own. Accordingly I look upon it as already done. I am anxious to hear what those friends of yours decide as to the letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> is as devoted to you as he is bound to be, and is greatly delighted at your remembering him. I am indeed strongly attached to our friend <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a>. For I have on the one hand transferred to him all the esteem which I had for his father, and on the other I love him for his own sake as much as I loved the other, — but it is you that I love the most for wishing us to be thus mutually attached. If you inspect the pleasure-grounds and tell me about the letter, you will give me something to write to you about: if not, I shall yet write something. For a subject will never be quite wanting. </p>                        </div>

XIII, 27) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM (25 MAY) I had always determined, and on very good grounds, that your friends should read my letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> before it was sent. If I had acted otherwise, I should have been wanting in courtesy to them, and almost rash in regard to my own danger in case my letter should prove offensive to him. Now your friends have acted frankly, and have obliged me by not suppressing their opinion; but best of all by suggesting so many alterations, that I have no reason for writing it all over again. And yet, in the matter of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=demonym long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> war, what ought I to have kept in view except what I thought was <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s wish? What, in fact, was the point of my letter at all except to say smooth things to him? Do you suppose that if I had wanted to give him the advice which I thought best, I should have been at a loss for language? Therefore the whole letter is altogether superfluous. For when no great hit is possible, and a miss, however slight, would bring unpleasant consequences, what need to run the risk? Especially as it occurs to me that, as I have not written to him before, he will think that I should probably not have written had not the war been over. Moreover, I fear his thinking that I meant this as a sop for my <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. There is no more to be said. I am extremely sorry I wrote it; nor could anything in this affair have fallen out more in accordance with my wishes, than to find that my intrusion is not approved. For I should have found myself also involved with that party, and among them with your relative. But to return to the pleasure-grounds. I absolutely will not have you go to them unless entirely convenient to yourself. There is no hurry. Whatever happens let us devote our efforts to <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>. How ever, tell me the day of the auction, if you know it.

About <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a> again you will write when he has arrived. As to the letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, believe my solemn assertion, I cannot! Nor is it the dishonour of the thing that deters me, though it ought to do so most of all. For where is the disgrace of flattery, in view of the disgrace of living at all? But as I began by saying, it is not the dishonour that deters me: and, indeed, I only wish it could — for then I should have been the man I ought to be — but I cannot think of anything to say. For those exhortations addressed to <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a> by men of eloquence and learning-think of the circumstances in which they were delivered! Here was a young man fired with ambition for the purest glory, desiring to have some suggestions made to him as to how to win undying fame, and they exhort him to follow honour. There is no lack of something to say in such a case. But what can I say? Nevertheless, I had roughhewn what seemed to me a kind of model. Because there were some things in it which were slightly coloured beyond the actual facts — present and past — adverse criticism is provoked, and I am not sorry for it. For if that letter had reached its destination, believe me, I should have repented it. Why, don't you see that even that famous pupil of <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, distinguished for the very best ability and the most perfect conduct, no sooner got the title of king than he became haughty, cruel, and ungovernable? Well now, do you think that this god of the procession, this messmate of <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, is likely to be gratified by temperate letters such as I should write? In truth, I would rather that he felt annoyed at not receiving what I had not written, than disapprove of what I had. In fine, let it be as he pleases. What was goading me on to action, at the time I put the Archimedian problem before you, is now all gone. By Heaven, I am now actually desirous — and much more earnestly — of that same misfortune of which I was then afraid, or any other he chooses. Unless anything else prevents you, pray come to me: you will be very welcome. <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> having been urgently summoned by <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> — for I read the letter-has gone against my will, yet at the same time on my advice. What follows I have written with my own hand. While I was by way of questioning <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a> about other matters in regard to men of learning, we fell upon the subject of <a href=/people/3974 target=_blank>Thalna</a>. He did not speak highly of his genius, but said that he was steady and of good character. But what follows did not seem to me to be satisfactory. He said that he knew him to have lately tried to marry Cornificia, daughter of Quintus, who was quite an old woman and had often been married before: that the ladies did not accept his proposal because they found that his property did not amount to more than 800 sestertia. I thought you ought to know this. 481 </p>                        </div>

XIII, 29) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM (27 MAY) I was informed about the suburban pleasure-grounds by your letter and by <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a>. In the villa, the vulgarity of which I have known of old, I see that nothing or very little has been changed: however, he praises the larger bath, and says that of the smaller one winter apartments might be made. Therefore, a small covered passage will have to be added, the building of which on the same scale as the one I constructed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> will cost about half less in that district. For the erection of the fane also, which I desire, nothing could be better suited than the grove which I used to know. But at that time it was not at all frequented, now I hear it is very much so. I couldn't have anything I should like better. In this matter in heaven's name indulge my whim. All I have to say more is — if <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a> pays his debt, don't stop to inquire the price: outbid <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>. I don't think, however, that he will lose his head about it, for I think I know the man. Moreover, I am told that he has been so hard hit, that I don't think that he is a buyer. Otherwise would he have let it come to the hammer? But why discuss that? If you get the money from <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>, let us purchase even at a high price: if not, we can't do it even at a low one. So then we must go to <a href=/people/2099 target=_blank>Clodia</a>. From her also I seem to have more hope, because, in the first place, the property is much less costly, and in the next place, <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s debt seems so safe that I feel certain of being also able to get ready money to pay for it. Enough about the pleasure-gardens. Tomorrow I shall see you, or hear some reason for your not coming: I expect it will be in connexion with <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>.

But while longing for your arrival, it is I after all, as I think, who will hinder you. For I don't suppose the <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a> business will be so promptly settled, even if it is ever to be so, as not to cause some delay. Come when you can then, since your arrival is still deferred. I should be much obliged if you would send me the books of <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> which you mention: add also the book of the Descent. As to the letter to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, my mind is made up. And yet the very thing which your friends assert that be writes — that he will not go against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> until everything is settled at home — is exactly the advice I gave all through that letter. I told him to do whichever he chose: that he might rely on my support. No doubt he is waiting for that, and is not likely to do anything except on my advice! Pray let us dismiss all such follies, and let us at least be half-free. That we can obtain by holding our tongues and living in retirement. Yes, approach <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a> as you suggest, and finish that business, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>: for I can hit on no other place where I can at once keep away from the forum and enjoy your society. As to the price however, the following occurs to me. Gaius Albanius is the nearest neighbour: he bought 1,000 iugera of M. <a href=/people/4269 target=_blank>Pilius</a>, as far as I can remember, for 11,500 sestertia. Prices are lower all round now. But we must add a great desire to buy, in which, with the exception of <a href=/people/824 target=_blank>Otho</a>, I do not think we shall have any competitor. But you will be able to influence him personally: you could have done so still more easily if you had had <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a> with you. What vulgar gluttony!

He has something to say against me also. I am sending you half the letter. For the other half, with the account of his achievements, I think you have in duplicate. I have sent a letter-carrier to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a> today. I have given him your letter to <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, which you had given <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>. I had just sent <a href=/people/1623 target=_blank>Demeas</a> to you when <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> arrived, but there was nothing new in the letter he brought except that the auction was to last two days. So you will come after it is over, as you say; and I hope with the <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a> affair settled. But <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> says that he won't settle today: he thinks he will tomorrow morning. You must be very polite to him. But such flatteries are almost criminal. I shall see you, I hope, the day after tomorrow. If you can do so from any source, find out who <a href=/people/782 target=_blank>Mummius</a>'s ten legates were. <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> doesn't give their names.

Yes, pray do as you say about <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>. For on our success in that depends entirely what I have in my mind. If that idea had never occurred to me I should, believe me, have been as in different to that as I am about everything else. Wherefore as you are doing at present — and I am sure it cannot be improved upon-push the matter on: don't let it rest: carry it through. Please send me both the books of <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a> — on the Soul and on the Descent. I can't find his Tripoliticus and his letter to <a href=/people/633 target=_blank>Aristoxenus</a>. I should be specially glad to have these three books; they would bear upon what I have in my mind. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: I have ordered it to be given to you. <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> and <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> I think you have already. To these books a new preface has been added, in which both of them are spoken of with commendation. I wish you to have these compositions, and there are some others. You didn't quite understand what I said to you about the ten legates, I suppose, because I wrote in shorthand. What I wanted to know was about <a href=/people/11038 target=_blank>Tuditanus</a>. <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> once told me that he was one of the ten. I see in <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>'s annals that he was praetor in the consulship of P. <a href=/people/677 target=_blank>Popilius</a> and P. <a href=/people/2927 target=_blank>Rupilius</a>. Could he have been a legatus fourteen years before he was praetor, unless his quaestorship was very late in life? And I don't think that that was so. For I notice that he easily obtained which <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> was employed to explain to the inhabitants. The labours of the commissioners occupied six months, and <a href=/people/160 target=_blank>Polybius</a> thinks that they did a very noble piece of work in the way of constitution-building. Hence <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> meant to choose them as speakers in a dialogue on constitutions, which, however, was never composed (Polyb. 39.15-16). the curule magistracies in his regular years. However, I did not know that <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a>, whose statue you say you remember in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379230SIst class=place long=22.9932 lat=37.9159>Isthmus</a>, was one of them. He is the man who was consul with L. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>. I have to thank you for this addition of a very suitable person to my Conference. So please see to the rest, if you can, that I may make a fine show even with my dramatis personae. </p>                        </div>

The fact is, I don't like your referring the matter to me. What! was I to manage my own business without your advice? But, after all, I quite understand that you do so more from your habitual caution than because you doubt the soundness of the debtors.

We must therefore be content with the present list. Sooner or later, indeed, you would have had to go security for me even in the auction with which we are now concerned. All then shall be provided from my own pocket: but as to the delay in getting in the debts, I think — if we do but hit upon what we want — that a time of grace may be obtained from the auctioneer, and at any rate from the heirs.

XII, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM, 31 MAY: Yes, inquire about <a href=/people/698 target=_blank>Caelius</a> as you say; I know nothing. We ought to ascertain his character, not only his means. Do the same as to <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> and <a href=/people/2676 target=_blank>Verginius</a>, if you feel any doubt: yet I don't think you will easily find anybody more eligible, as far as I can see. Yes, negotiate with <a href=/people/4221 target=_blank>Mustela</a> in the manner you suggest, when <a href=/people/1533 target=_blank>Crispus</a> arrives. I have written to tell <a href=/people/8941 target=_blank>Avius</a> to inform <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> of the facts, with which he is well acquainted, as to the gold. For I quite agree with you: that business has dragged on too long, and we must now call in money from all directions. I have no difficulty in seeing that you neither do nor think of anything but what is to my interests, and that it is by my business that your eagerness to visit me is foiled. But I imagine you by my side, not merely because you are employed in my service, but also because I seem to see how you are acting. And, indeed, not a single hour which you devote to my business escapes my observation. I see that <a href=/people/3094 target=_blank>Tubulus</a> was praetor in the consulship of and Purser; but it is very likely corrupt. Dr. Reid, in particular, rejects a me igitur omnia. Lucius <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and Quintus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a>. At present I should like to ascertain in what Consulship Publius <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, the <a href=/people/12031 target=_blank>Pontifex Maximus</a>, was tribune. I think it was in that of <a href=/people/1001 target=_blank>Caepio</a> and <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>: for he was praetor in the year of Lucius <a href=/people/463 target=_blank>Furius</a> and Sextus <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a>. Please therefore tell me the year of <a href=/people/3094 target=_blank>Tubulus</a>'s tribunate, and, if you Can, on what charge he was tried. And pray look to see whether Lucius <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>, who brought in the bill about <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> <a href=/people/420 target=_blank>Galba</a>, was tribune in the consulship of <a href=/people/2605 target=_blank>Censorinus</a> and <a href=/people/1949 target=_blank>Manilius</a>, or T. <a href=/people/757 target=_blank>Quinctius</a> and <a href=/people/382 target=_blank>Manius</a> <a href=/people/584 target=_blank>Acilius</a>. Also I am puzzled about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s epitome of the history of <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>. I put down what I found at the end of that epitome, and taking it as my guide, I stated that <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> — the author of the history-was son-in-law to <a href=/people/318 target=_blank>Laelius</a>. But you proved to demonstration that I was wrong. Now <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a> refute you. However, I had good authority — that of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> — for my statement as it appears in the <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>.

I have received <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>'s book, and I am waiting for his Descent.

You will be able to ascertain from <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, of course, in what year he was quaestor or military tribune. If he was neither, hunt him up and see whether he was among the praefecti or the attaches-always provided that he was engaged in that war at all. </p>                        </div>

I cannot exaggerate its cordial and affectionate tone. However, we came at last to the subject of Quintus. He told me many things beyond words-beyond expression: but there was one of such a kind that, had it not been notorious to the whole army, I should not have ventured, I don't say to dictate to Tiro, but even to write it with my own hand. But enough of that.

For who would have feared such a thing as this — a thing that had never happened before and which nature seemed to forbid the possibility of happening? Therefore there is nothing that may not be feared. But this is an historical slip of yours — the last person I should have expected to make it — that I am the sole remaining consular. Why, what do you think of <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>? However, this survival has of course no value of any sort-especially to me, who think that their fate is no less happy than my own. For what am I, and what influence do I possess? Is it at home or abroad? Well, if it had not occurred to me to write my poor books, I shouldn't have known what to do with myself. Yes, as you say, I think I must dedicate to <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> some treatise of a more general kind and more political in tone. Something certainly I must compose for him; for he is very desirous that I should do so. If <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> takes any step, pray be careful to let me know. I think he ought to do it as soon as possible, especially if he has made up his mind. He will thereby either entirely stop, or at any rate mitigate, any little talk there may be about it. For there are people who talk even to me. But he will settle these things best himself, especially if he also consults you. I intend starting on the 21st: for I have nothing to do here, nor, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>! there either, or anywhere: yet there, after all, there is something. Today I am expecting <a href=/people/2258 target=_blank>Spinther</a>; for <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has sent him to me. He writes to clear <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> in regard to the death of <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> — on whom no suspicion would have fallen, even if his assassination had been the consequence of a plot. As it is, as there is no doubt whatever about <a href=/people/2111 target=_blank>Magius</a>. Does not his madness account for the whole thing? I don't clearly understand what he means. Please explain therefore. However, for myself my only doubt is as to the cause of <a href=/people/2111 target=_blank>Magius</a>'s mad fury. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> had even gone security for him. No doubt that is the true explanation — he was insolvent. I suppose he had asked some indulgence from <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, who — as was his way — had answered him somewhat decidedly. </p>                        </div>

But I had to do it, both in order to settle the small rents of my properties, and to avoid burdening <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> with the necessity of showing me attention.

Please therefore write and tell me whether <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> has arrived, whether <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has taken any decided step, even if he has determined on doing so, and when he starts to meet <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>- anything in fact that I ought to know.

However, they also healed the wound. For the fact that you consoled yourself in the same letter gave me sufficient assurance to alleviate my distress. You have given my speech for <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> a famous start. Henceforth, whenever I write anything, I shall intrust the advertising to you. As to what you say in your letter about <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, you are aware that heretofore my speeches and writings of that nature have been composed in a way that made the introduction anywhere of <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> impossible. But when I began these more literary works, <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> had already announced to me a dedication of an important treatise. Two years have passed, and that <a href=/people/3549 target=_blank>Callippides</a>, though perpetually on the move, has not advanced a yard. I, on the other hand, am preparing to return anything he sent me, measure and all and even better — if I had but the power: for even <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> adds the proviso if you can. As things stand at present I have plighted to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, as you advised, my treatise de Finibus, of which I think very highly, and you wrote to say that he was not unwilling to accept it. So let us transfer to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> my Academica, in which the speakers are men of rank, as far as that goes, but being in no respect men of learning are made to speak with a subtlety beyond them. It contains the doctrines of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, with which he is in full agreement. I will make it up to <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> and <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> in some other work. However, this depends on your approval, so pray write me an answer on this point. I have had a letter from <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a> about the auction of <a href=/people/7400 target=_blank>Brinnius</a>'s estate. He says that the direction of the business has been unanimously confided to me — they presumed evidently that I should be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> on the 24th of June. Please therefore speak to my co-heir, your friend <a href=/people/862 target=_blank>Spurius</a> <a href=/people/1359 target=_blank>Vettius</a>, or to our friend <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a>, to put off the auction a short time, and say that I shall be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> about the 7th of July.

The Academic treatise I have transferred bodily to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>. At one time it was in the mouths of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, and <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>.

As you have not, I have only the same questions to ask as before: What is <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> doing? Or, if he has already taken any step, is there any news from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? But why talk of these things which I care less about? What I am anxious to know is how <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> is. Though your letter — which however is now rather out of date-bids me hope for the best, yet I am anxious for something recent. You see what advantage there is in our being near each other. By all means let us get suburban pleasure-grounds: we seemed to be conversing with each other when I was in my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa — so frequent was the interchange of letters. But that at least will soon be the case again. Meanwhile, acting on your hint, I have completed some books — really quite clever ones — addressed to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>. Nevertheless I await your answer to what I wrote to you: first, how you learnt that he wanted something of the sort from me, since he has never, for all his extraordinary literary activity, addressed a line to me: secondly, of whom he was jealous, unless I am to think it to be <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. For if he is not jealous of him, much less can he be so of <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a> or of the interlocutors in the de <a href=/people/8240 target=_blank>Republica</a>. I should like you to make this quite clear to me: especially whether you abide by your opinion that I should send him what I have written, or whether you think it unnecessary.

XIII, 19) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM, 29 JUNE: <a href=/people/4557 target=_blank>Hilarus</a> the copyist had just left me on the 28th, to whom I had delivered a letter for you, when your letter-carrier arrived with yours dated the day before: in which the sentence that pleased me most was, Our dear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> begs you not to be cast down, and that in which you say that all danger is over. To my speech for <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> I see that your authority has served as an excellent advertisement. For <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> have written to say that they like it extremely, and have therefore sent that poor little speech to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. So this is what you meant by what you wrote to me before. As to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, I should not be influenced by the motive you mention, that is, to avoid being thought fond of great men — for my principle has always been not to include any living person among the interlocutors of my dialogues. But as you say that it is desired by <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> and that he will value it highly, I have composed the books and finished a complete review of the whole Academic philosophy in four books — how well I can't say, but with a minute care which nothing could surpass. In them the arguments so brilliantly deduced by <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> against the doctrine of ἀκαταληψία (impossibility of attaining certainty) I have assigned to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>. To them I answer in person. You are the third personage in our conversation. If I had represented <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a> and <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> as keeping up the argument, according to the suggestion contained in your last letter, I should have been myself a persona muta. This is often the case with graceful effect in ancient dramatis personae — for instance, <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> did it in many of his dialogues, and so did I in the six books of the de <a href=/people/8240 target=_blank>Republica</a>. So again in my three books de <a href=/people/5145 target=_blank>Oratore</a> with which I am fully satisfied. In these too the persons represented are of such a character that silence on my part was natural. For the speakers are <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a>, the veteran <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, Gaius <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Iulius</a>, the brother of <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>, and <a href=/people/228 target=_blank>Sulpicius</a>. The conversation is represented as taking place when I was a mere boy, so that I could have no part in it. On the other hand, my writings in the present period follow the Aristotelian fashion — the conversation of the other characters is so represented as to leave him the leading part. My five books de Finibus were so arranged as to give L. <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicurean</a> arguments, Marcus <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>, Marcus <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> the <a href=/people/407 target=_blank>Peripatetic</a>. I thought that could rouse no jealousy, as all those persons were dead. This new work Academica, as you know, I had divided between <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a>, <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, and <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>. It was quite inappropriate to their characters: for it was more learned than anything they would appear likely to have ever dreamed of. Accordingly, I no sooner read your letter about <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> than I caught at the idea as a godsend. For there could be nothing more appropriate than <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> to that school of philosophy, in which he appears to me to take the greatest pleasure, and that my part should be such as to avoid the appearance of having arranged to give my side of the argument the superiority. For in fact the arguments of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> are very convincing. As carefully translated by me they retain all the acuteness of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, with the polish peculiar to the language of our countrymen — if there is indeed any such to be found in me. But pray consider carefully whether I ought to present these books to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>. Certain objections occur to me — but of those when we meet. </p>                        </div>

XIII, 21) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM (JUNE 30) Now just tell me — do you think it right, to begin with, to publish at all without an order from me? <a href=/people/2234 target=_blank>Hermodorus</a> himself used not to do that — the man who made a practice of circulating <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>'s books, whence came the line: In note-books <a href=/people/2234 target=_blank>Hermodorus</a> makes his gain. And again: do you think it right to show it to anyone before <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, to whom, on your advice, I dedicate it? For <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> has written to tell me that you have allowed him to take a copy of the fifth book of the de Finibus, in which, though I have not made very many alterations, yet I have made some. I shall be very much obliged to you if you will keep back the other books, so that <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> may not have what is uncorrected, and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> what is stale. But enough of that, lest I seem to make a fuss about trifles. Yet, in the present circumstances, these things are of the utmost consequence in my eyes. For what else is there to care about? What I have written I am in such haste to send to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, as you advise, that I have already despatched it to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> to be copied out. This you shall have at once, if you so wish. For I have written to tell the copyists that your men should have permission to make a copy of them if you chose. Please, however, keep it to yourself till I see you, as you always do with the greatest care when you have been told by me to do so. But how did it escape me to tell you? <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a> — wonderfully inflamed no doubt by a zeal for philosophy — is taking a copy from yours: she already has those very books of the de Finibus. Now I assure you — though I am mortal and fallible — that she did not get them from mine, for they have never been out of my sight: and so far from my men having made two copies, they scarcely completed one copy of each book. However, I don't charge your men with any dereliction of duty, and so I would have you think: for I omitted to say that I did not wish them to get abroad yet. Dear me! what a time I am talking about trifles! The fact is, I have nothing to say on business. About <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> I agree with you. Yes, I will meet my co-heirs, as you suggest, at my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa. As to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arrival, <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> writes to say that it will not be before the 1st of August. I am very glad to hear about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, that her attack is lighter and less serious, and that she bears it cheerfully. You mention that idea of ours, in which I am as earnest as yourself. As far as my knowledge goes, I strongly approve of the man, the family, and the fortune. What is most important of all, though I don't know him personally, I hear nothing but good of him, among others recently from <a href=/people/5244 target=_blank>Scrofa</a>. We may add, if that is of any consequence, that he is better born even than his father. Therefore when we meet I will talk about it, and with a predisposition in favour of him.

XIII, 20) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM (2 JULY) I have received a letter of consolation from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, dated 31st of May, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374000UHis class=place long=-5.9909 lat=37.3903>Hispalis</a>. I did not understand the nature of the bill published for extending the boundaries of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>City</a>: I should much like to know about it. I am glad that <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> is satisfied with what I have done for him, and I will not cease adding to those services. To the speech for <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> it is not now either possible to add a clause about <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>'s wife and step-daughter — for the speech is by this time very widely known-nor do I wish to annoy <a href=/people/1301 target=_blank>Tubero</a>: for he is astonishingly sensitive. You certainly had a good audience! For my part, though I get on very comfortably in this place, I nevertheless long to see you. So I shall be with you as I arranged. I suppose you have met my brother. I am therefore anxious to know what you said to him. As to reputation, I am not at all inclined to trouble myself, though I did say foolishly in that letter that it was better than anything else. For it is not a thing for me to be anxious about. And don't you see how truly philosophical this sentiment is — that every man is bound not to depart a nail's breadth from the strict path of conscience? Do you think that it is all for nothing that I am now engaged in these compositions? I would not have you feel distressed by that remark, which amounted to nothing. For I return to the same point again. Do you suppose that I care for anything in the whole question except not to be untrue to my past? I am striving, forsooth, to maintain my reputation in the courts! Not in them I trust! I only wish I could bear my home sorrows as easily as I can disregard that! But do you think that I had set my heart on something that has not been accomplished? Self-praise is no commendation: still, though I cannot fail to approve of what I did then, yet I can with a good grace refrain from troubling myself about it, as in fact I do. But I have said too much on a trivial subject. </p>                        </div>

XIII, 22) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM (4 JULY) As to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, I had my reasons for being so particular to ascertain your opinion. Certain objections occur to me, but of them when we meet. For yourself, I have introduced your name with the greatest possible pleasure, and I shall do it still more frequently; for from your last letter I have for the first time satisfied myself that you are not unwilling that it should be so. About <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> had written to me before; <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> sent details. What a melancholy thing! To return to my subject. There are no hands in which I would rather my writings were than yours: but I wish them not to be published before we both agree upon doing so. For my part, I absolve your copyists from all blame, nor do I find any fault with you; and yet, after all, what I mentioned in a previous letter was a breach of this understanding — that <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a> had certain of my writings which she could only have had from you. As for <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, I quite understand that it was necessary to gratify him: only I don't like either <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> being given anything stale, or <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> anything unfinished. I will send it to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> as soon as I see you, if you approve. Why I have hesitated about it, however, I will tell you when we meet. I fully approve of your calling in the money from the debtors assigned to me. I am sorry that you are being troubled about <a href=/people/6747 target=_blank>Ovia</a>'s estate. It is a great nuisance about our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>: but such is life! The ladies, however, don't show very good feeling in their hostile attitude to each other — though both of them do all that propriety requires. There was nothing in the possession of my secretary <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> for you to demand if there had been I would have instructed you to do so. The fact is that he holds no money that was set apart for the vow, though there is something of mine in his hands. That sum I have resolved to transfer to this purchase. So we were both right — I in telling you where it was, he in denying it to you. But let us at once pounce upon this very money also. In the case of a shrine for human beings I don't think well of a grove, because it is not much frequented: yet there is something to say for it. However, this point too shall be settled in accordance with your opinion, as everything else is. I shall come to town the day I fixed: and I hope to heaven you will come the same day. But if anything prevents you — for a hundred things may do so — at any rate the next day. Why, think of the co-heirs, and of my being left to their tender mercies without your cunning! This is the second letter I have had without a word about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. However, I put a very hopeful construction on that. I don't lay the blame on you, but on her, that there isn't so much as a kind regards. However, give my kindest, both to her and <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>, and don't in spite of all hint that I am angry. I am sending you <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s letter, in case you have not read it. </p>                        </div>

Naturally the Caesarians thought it a dangerous alliance, and especially his mother <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> — the warm friend and perhaps mistress of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> says that it is a pity the two ladies are unfriendly to each other, but, he adds, they keep up appearances and do all that their respective positions demand. that he had to be kept But I didn't quite tear his cloak in my efforts to keep him (for I remember that expression of yours), and they were a large party and I was not prepared. How did that help me? Soon after came Gaius <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> with Titus <a href=/people/7440 target=_blank>Carrinas</a>. I hardly laid a finger on their cloaks; yet they stopped, and very a propos (though by chance) <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> fell to talking about the enlargement of the city: the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> is to be diverted, starting from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BBMi class=place long=12.4671 lat=41.9352>Milvian bridge</a> along the Vatican Hills: the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a> is to be covered with buildings; while the Vatican plain is to become a kind of new <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCMa class=place long=12.481 lat=41.905>Campus Martius</a>. What do you say? said I, why, I was going to the auction, to secure Scapula's pleasure-grounds if I could safely do so. Don't do anything of the sort, said he, for the law will be carried. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> wishes it. I didn't betray any annoyance at the information, but I am annoyed at the scheme. What do you say to it? But I needn't ask: you know what a quidnunc <a href=/people/903 target=_blank>Capito</a> is, always finding some mare's nest: he is as bad as <a href=/people/838 target=_blank>Camillus</a>.

As to what you say in your letter about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, I have left him quite free to do as he likes as far as I am concerned: for I wrote yesterday to tell him that I had no occasion for his assistance on the 15th. </p>                        </div>

I had rather that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> had asked me to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For it would have been fairer, considering that a journey both unexpected and long was before him. And, by heaven! nowadays, as the state of our feelings forbids our getting on frankly together — for I certainly need not tell you what constitutes being good company -I should be glad if our meeting were at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> rather than at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. The books dedicated to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> won't be long delayed. They are completed, as you have seen. There only remains the correction of the mistakes of the copyists. About these books you know that I had some hesitation, but I leave it to you. Also those I am dedicating to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> the copyists have in hand. Yes, as you say in your letter, get my business through. However, <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> says that everybody makes that rebate you mention; what, then, do you suppose those fellows will do? You know the gang. So settle the affair without any friction. You'd scarcely believe how indifferent I am about such things. I solemnly declare to you, and pray believe me, that those trumpery properties are more a bore than a pleasure to me. For I grieve more at not having anyone to whom to transmit them than at being in want of immediate cash. And so <a href=/people/1407 target=_blank>Trebatius</a> says that he told you. Now perhaps you were afraid that I should be sorry to hear your report. That was like your kindness, but believe me I am now quite indifferent about those things. Wherefore devote your energies to these conferences: get your knife well in and finish the business. When talking to <a href=/people/5916 target=_blank>Polla</a> consider that you are talking with that fellow <a href=/people/2929 target=_blank>Scaeva</a>, and don't imagine that men who are accustomed to try to lay hands on what is not owed to them will abate anything that is.

Yet your letter is so full of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, that you don't say a word about yourself. But when do you think he is coming? For I intend to arrive in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 14th. I meant in my letter to tell <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> — but since you say that you have read it, I was not perhaps quite clear — that I understood from your letter that he did not wish me to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> now out of compliment as it were to himself. But since my arrival in town is now approaching, pray take care that the Ides (the 15th) don't prevent him from being at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> if that suits his convenience. For I am not likely to want him at the auction. In a business of that kind why are you not sufficient by yourself? But I do want him at the making of my will.

I have written to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, therefore, to say that there was not the occasion for his presence on the 15th, which I had contemplated. So I should like you to direct the whole of this business in such a way as to prevent our inconveniencing <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> in any particular, however small. But pray, why in the world are you in such a fright at my bidding you send the books to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> at your own risk? Even at this eleventh hour, if you have any doubt, let me know. Nothing can be more finished than they are. I want <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> to take a part in them, especially as he desires it himself: but he is, as you know, Keen-eyed for faults, to blame the blameless prone. The expression of his face often occurs to me as he perhaps complains, for instance, that in these books my side in the argument is defended at greater length than his own. That, on my honour, you will find not to be the case if you ever get your holiday in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a> — for at present my works have to give place to <a href=/people/7212 target=_blank>Alexion</a>'s business letters. But after all I don't despair of the book securing <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s approval, and I am not sorry that my plan should be persisted in, as I have gone to some expense in long paper; but I say again and again — it shall be done at your risk. Wherefore, if you have any hesitation, let us change to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, for he too is an adherent of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>. What an excellent likeness of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAca class=place long=23.707 lat=37.992>Academy</a> itself, with its instability, its shifting views, now this way and now that!

The people were splendid not to clap even the figure of <a href=/people/335 target=_blank>Victory</a> owing to its impious neighbour. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has been to see me, and is very strongly in favour of my writing something to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. I assented, but this procession puts me off it. Well, after all, did you venture to make the presentation to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>? I am anxious for his opinion: but when will he read it through? As to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, I quite approve: for it is something that her melancholy should be relieved both by taking part in the spectacle, as well as by the feeling of its sacred associations and the general talk about it. Please send me a <a href=/people/439 target=_blank>Cotta</a>; I have got a <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> with me, and I had already possessed a <a href=/people/1659 target=_blank>Casca</a>. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> brought me a message from Titus <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> that the mention of L. <a href=/people/6383 target=_blank>Corfidius</a> in my speech for <a href=/people/3417 target=_blank>Ligarius</a> was a mistake of mine. But it was only what is called a lapse of memory. I knew that <a href=/people/6383 target=_blank>Corfidius</a> was very closely connected with the Ligarii, but I see now that he was already dead. Please therefore instruct <a href=/people/452 target=_blank>Pharnaces</a>, <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a>, and <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> to erase that name from all the copies. </p>                        </div>

XIII, 21) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ASTURA, 28 JULY: I have despatched a very bulky letter to <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> which I recently wrote at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. That which you have sent me I will answer another time. For the present I prefer other subjects. What can I do about <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a> unless I hear something from <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>? As soon as I do you shall know at once. I expect letter-carriers from him today, or at latest tomorrow. As soon as they arrive they shall be sent on to you. I am expecting to hear from Quintus. For as I was starting from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> on the 25th, as you know, I sent letter-carriers to him. Now to return to business: the word inhibere suggested by you, which I thought very attractive, I am now strongly against. For it is an entirely nautical word. Of course I knew that, but I thought that the vessel was held up (sustineri) when the rowers were ordered inhibere. But that that is not the case I learnt yesterday, when a ship was being brought to land opposite my villa. For when ordered inhibere the rowers don't hold up the vessel, they back water. Now that is a meaning as remote as possible from ἐποχή (suspension of judgment). Wherefore pray let it stand in the book as it was. Tell <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> this also, if by any chance he has made an alteration. One can't have a better authority than <a href=/people/628 target=_blank>Lucilius</a>: Bring to a halt (sustineas) chariot and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, as oft doth a skilful driver. Again, <a href=/people/711 target=_blank>Carneades</a> always uses the guard (προβολη) of a boxer and the pulling up (retentio) of a charioteer as metaphorical expressions for suspension of judgment (ἐποχή): but the inhibitio of rowers connotes motion, and indeed an unusually violent one — the action of the oars driving the vessel backwards. You see how much more eager and interested I am on this point than either about rumours or about <a href=/people/701 target=_blank>Pollio</a>. Tell me too about <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, whether there is any confirmation — for I think it must have been made public: also about <a href=/people/7550 target=_blank>Critonius</a>, whatever is known, and at least about <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a> and <a href=/people/5498 target=_blank>Balbinus</a>. </p>                        </div>

He asks me earnestly to be in the senate on the 1st, saying that I shall greatly gratify both <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> and himself by so doing. I think, for my part, that there is nothing in it: for perhaps <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> would have said something to you, as <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> is ill. However, I preferred to come for nothing rather than be absent if I was wanted: I should have regretted it afterwards. So today I shall be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>; tomorrow, at my town house before noon.

I mean to hurry back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a> on the 1st; for I prefer all negotiations with them to go on in my absence.

Oh, that it may be so! Oh, that it may! I repeat. But only if convenient to yourself.

For Babullius is dead. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, I imagine, is heir to a twelfth — though I don't know anything for certain as yet — but Lepta to a third. Now he is in a fright that he may not be allowed to keep the inheritance. His fear is unreasonable, but nevertheless he is afraid. So if he does summon me, I will hurry to town: if he doesn't, it won't be in any way necessary. Yes, send Pollex as soon as you can. I am sending you <a href=/people/2013 target=_blank>Porcia</a>'s funeral oration corrected: I have been expeditious in order that, if it is by any chance being sent to <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a>'s son or to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, it may be this edition that is sent.

As to <a href=/people/2799 target=_blank>Xenon</a>'s debt to you and the forty sestertia due to you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, no arrangement could be more convenient or suitable than what you suggest in your letter. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> the younger had made the same suggestion to me in conversation. I have absolutely no news except that <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> has kept up a keen controversy with Quintus on my behalf: that the latter talks violently in all kinds of places and especially at dinner parties: that much of this talk is directed against me, but that he also falls upon his father. Nothing he says, however, has a greater vraisemblance than his assertion that we are bitterly opposed to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: that we are neither of us to be trusted, while I personally ought to be regarded with suspicion-this would have been truly terrible had I not perceived that our monarch knew that I had no courage left. Lastly, that my son is being bullied by me. But that he may say as much as he chooses. I am glad I had handed <a href=/people/2013 target=_blank>Porcia</a>'s funeral oration to Lepta's letter-carrier before I got your letter. Take care then, as you love me, that it is sent to <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> — if it is going to be sent — in the form you mention. About the gladiators and the other things, which you call in your letter airy nothings, give me particulars day by day. I should wish, if you think it right, to apply to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> and Offilius. About giving notice of the auction I myself spoke to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. He agreed — I presume that Offilius has a complete inventory, and so has <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> — well, he agreed that it should be on an early day and at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: but that, if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s arrival was delayed, it might be put off from day today. But the latter seems to be on the point of arriving. Therefore consider the whole business: for <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a> is content. </p>                        </div>

Then, after going to sleep again and getting up at sunrise, a letter from your sister's son is put into my hands, which I herewith send to you in the original copy. It begins with a gross insult. But perhaps he didn't stop to think. Well, this is how it begins: Whatever can be said to your discredit I___ He will have it that much can be said to my discredit, but says that he does not endorse it. Could anything be in worse taste? Well, you shall read the rest — for I send it on to you — and judge for yourself. My belief is that it was because the fellow was disturbed by the daily and persistent compliments of our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> — the expression of which by him in regard to us has been reported to me by a very large number of people — that he has at length deigned to write to me and to you. Please let me know if that is so. For what he has written to his father about me I don't know. About his mother, how truly filial! I had wished, he says, to be with you as much as possible, and that a house should be taken for me; and I wrote to you to that effect. You have neglected to do it. Therefore we shall see much less of each other: for I cannot bear the sight of your house; you know why. The reason to which he alludes, his father tells me, is hatred of his mother. Now, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, assist me with your advice: Scale the high-built wall shall I By justice pure and verity? That is, shall I openly renounce and disown the fellow, or shall I proceed by crooked wiles? For as was the case with <a href=/people/166 target=_blank>Pindar</a>, My mind divided cannot hit the truth. On the whole the former is best suited to my character, the latter to the circumstances of the time. However, consider me as accepting whatever decision you have come to.

What became, then, of that chef-d'oeuvre of yours which I saw in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAth class=place long=23.7271 lat=37.9715>Parthenon</a>-I mean the <a href=/people/7192 target=_blank>Ahala</a> and <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> pedigree? But what is he to do? That's excellent hearing! Not even has the prime author of the whole black business a good word to say of our nephew. Why, I was beginning to be afraid that even <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> was fond of him. For that seemed the meaning of the sentence in his letter to me: But I could wish that you had a taste of his conversations with me. But, as you say, of this when we meet. And yet, which do you advise me to do? Am I to hurry to meet him or to stay where I am? The fact is, I am glued to my books, and on the other hand don't want to entertain him here. His father, as I am told, is gone as far as <a href=/people/2444 target=_blank>Saxa</a> to meet him in a high state of exasperation. He went in such an angry frame of mind that I was forced to remonstrate. But then I am much of a weather-cock myself. So we must wait and see. However, please consider your view as to my coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> and the whole situation; if it appears plain to you tomorrow, let me know early in the day. </p>                        </div>

When he complained that his son was on bad terms with his mother, and said that on that account he intended to give up the house to his son, I told him that the latter had written a becoming letter to his mother, but not a word to you. He expressed surprise at the former, but said that in regard to you the fault was his own, because he had frequently written in indignant terms to his son as to your unfairness to him. In this respect he says that his feelings have softened; so I read him your letter, and on the crooked paths principle indicated that I would not stand in the way. The fact is, we went on to talk of Cana. Certainly, if that were decided upon, it would be necessary for me to act thus. But, as you say, we must have some regard to our dignity, and both of us ought to take the same line, although the wrongs he has done me are the more serious, or at least the more notorious, of the two. If however <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> also has some reasons to allege, all hesitation is at an end. But of this when we meet: for it is a very serious business and needs great caution. Tomorrow therefore, unless I get something from you this evening. 637 </p>                        </div>

This letter, though dated earlier than that brought by <a href=/people/7600 target=_blank>Diochares</a>, yet made it quite clear that he would arrive before the <a href=/people/925 target=_blank>Ludi Romani</a>. At the end of the letter there was a sentence ordering him to make all necessary preparations for the games, and not allow him to hurry back for nothing. Certainly from this letter it seemed beyond doubt that he would come before that day, and <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> said that <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> thought so too after reading that letter. I perceive I have thus some additional days holiday, but pray, as you love me, let me know how many. You will be able to ascertain from <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> and your other neighbour <a href=/people/1779 target=_blank>Egnatius</a>. You exhort me to spend these days in an exposition of philosophy.

Please write and tell me your opinion. For my part, if I had to pick out a man from the whole world, I couldn't easily have selected anyone more painstaking, obliging, or, by heaven, more zealous to serve me than <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>.

XIII, 46) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM, 12 AUGUST: POLLEX, for his part, having appointed to meet me by the 13th of August, has in fact done so at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a> on the 12th. But he was true to his name — a thumb and not a finger, he pointed to nothing. You must get your information, therefore, from his own lips. I have been to call on <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>; for Lepta, being anxious about his own contract for the wine, had induced me to go and see him. He was staying in that villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a> which he has made over to <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>. The first thing he said to me was: I recently received a letter from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, in which he positively asserts that he will arrive before the <a href=/people/925 target=_blank>Ludi Romani</a>. I read the letter. There was a good deal about my <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. He says that by repeatedly reading it he had increased his command of language: when he had read the <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> he thought himself eloquent. Next I learnt from him that acceptance of <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a>'s inheritance (oh, careless <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>!) was to be an unconditional acceptance in the presence of Witnesses within sixty days. I was afraid I should have to send for <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>. As it is, I need only send him a commission to accept on my order. This same Pollex therefore shall go. I also discussed the question of <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a>'s suburban pleasure-grounds with <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. Nothing could be more liberal: he said that he would write to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> at once: but that <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a> had left <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a> a legacy of fifty sestertia (480 pounds), charged on Hordeonius's share, as also money for his tomb and many other things, but that my share had no charge on it. Pray give <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a> a gentle rebuke. What could be less proper than that the druggist <a href=/people/3072 target=_blank>Plotius</a> should have employed his servants to give <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> full particulars so long in advance, while he gave me none even by my own? I am sorry about <a href=/people/3158 target=_blank>Cossinius</a>; I was very fond of him. I will assign to Quintus whatever surplus there is after paying my debts and purchases. The latter I expect will force me to borrow more. About the house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> I know nothing.

This cause, indeed, I had undertaken against the sons of Gnaeus <a href=/people/321 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, much against my will — but I did also wish well to Phamea. For, if I remember rightly, when I was standing for the consulship he sent me a promise through you to do anything he could; and I was no less mindful of that courtesy than if I had availed myself of it. He called on me and told me that the arbitrator had arranged to take his case on the very day on which the jury were bound by the Pompeian law to consider their verdict on our friend <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>. For you are aware that the days in those suits have been fixed by law. I replied that he was not ignorant of my obligations to <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>: if he selected any other day he chose, I would not fail to appear for him. So on that occasion he left me in a rage. I think I told you about it. I didn't trouble myself, of course, nor did I think that the wholly groundless anger of a man not in the least connected with me required any attention from me. But the last time I was in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> I told <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> what I had heard, without however mentioning the younger <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a> made it his business to go into the matter, as he writes me word. He says that the allegation of <a href=/people/6021 target=_blank>Tigellius</a> is that I suspect him because I have it on my conscience that I left Phamea in the lurch. Wherefore all I ask you to do is to get anything you can from our friend the younger <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, but not to trouble yourself about me. It is a sop to one's dignity to have some one to hate without restraint and not to be a slave to everybody (as the man was not asleep to everybody). Yet, by heaven, as you know very well, those men are rather acting as slaves to me, if to pay a man constant attentions is being a slave. </p>                        </div>

But on his arrival at the villa of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> on the evening of the second day of the <a href=/people/12227 target=_blank>Saturnalia</a>, the villa was so choke full of soldiers that there was scarcely a dining-room left for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself to dine in.

I was in a great taking as to what was to happen the next day; and so <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> <a href=/people/7360 target=_blank>Barba</a> came to my aid and gave me guards.

He stayed with <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> on the third day of the <a href=/people/12227 target=_blank>Saturnalia</a> till one o'clock, without admitting anyone. He was engaged on his accounts, I think, with <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>. Then he took a walk on the beach. After two he went to the bath. Then he heard about <a href=/people/5102 target=_blank>Mamurra</a> without changing countenance. He was anointed: took his place at the table. He was under a course of emetics, and so ate and drank without scruple and as suited his taste. It was a very good dinner, and well served, and not only so, but Well cooked, well seasoned food, with rare discourse: A banquet in a word to cheer the heart. Besides this, the staff were entertained in three rooms in a very liberal style. The freedmen of lower rank and the slaves had everything they could want. But the upper sort had a really recherche dinner. In fact, I showed that I was somebody. However, he is not a guest to whom one would say, Pray look me up again on your way back. Once is enough. We didn't say a word about politics. There was plenty of literary talk. In short, he was pleased and enjoyed himself. He said he should stay one day at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>, another at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PBai class=place long=14.0699 lat=40.8178>Baiae</a>. That's the story of the entertainment, or I might call it the billeting on me — trying to the temper, but not seriously inconvenient. I am staying on here for a short time and then go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. When he was passing <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s villa, the whole guard formed up on the right and left of his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and nowhere else.

XIII, 42) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM (END OF DECEMBER) He has been to see me and with a very dejected air. Said I to him: Why so gloomy? Can you ask, said he, when I am about to start on a journey, and a journey to the seat of war — a journey, too, that is not only dangerous, but discreditable as well?  What is the compulsion, then? said I. Debt, said he, and yet I haven't even money enough for the journey. At this point I took a hint from your kind of eloquence. I held my tongue. He went on: But what gives me most pain is my uncle.  Why is that? said I. Because he is angry with me, said he. Why do you allow him to be so, said I-for I prefer using that word to Why do you incur it? I won't allow it, said he, for I will remove the reason. Excellent ! said I; but if it won't be disagreeable to you, I should like to know what the reason is. Because, while hesitating as to whom to marry, I vexed my mother, and consequently him too. However, nothing can make up for doing that in my eyes. I will do what they wish. I wish you good luck, I said, and I commend your resolution. But when is it to be? Oh, I don't care about the time, he said, since I accept the thing. Well, my opinion is, said I, that you should do it before starting. You will thus oblige your father also. I will do as you think right, said he. This was the end of our conversation. But listen to me! You know the 3rd of January is my birthday. You must come to dinner therefore.

XIV, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) MATIUS'S SUBURBAN VILLA, 7 APRIL: I have come on a visit to the man, of whom I was talking to you this morning. His view is that the state of things is perfectly shocking: that there is no way out of the embroglio. For if a man of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s genius failed, who can hope to succeed? In short, he says that the ruin is complete. I am not sure that he is wrong but then he rejoices in it, and declares that within twenty days there will be a rising in Gaul: that he has not had any conversation with anyone except <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a> since the Ides of March: finally that these things can't pass off like this. What a wise man <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a> is, who regrets <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> quite as much, but yet says nothing that can offend any loyalist! But enough of this. Pray don't be idle about writing me word of anything new, for I expect a great deal. Among other things, whether we can rely on Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>; but above all about our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, of whom my host says that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was in the habit of remarking: It is of great importance what that man wishes; at any rate, whatever he wishes he wishes strongly: and that he noticed, when he was pleading for <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404297PNic class=place long=29.7168 lat=40.4266>Nicaea</a>, that he seemed to speak with great spirit and freedom. Also — for I like to jot down things as they occur to me — that when on the request of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> I went to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s house, and was sitting waiting till I was called in, he remarked: Can I doubt that I am exceedingly disliked, when Marcus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> has to sit waiting and cannot see me at his own convenience? And yet if there is a good-natured man in the world it is he; still I feel no doubt that he heartily dislikes me. This and a good deal of the same sort. But to my purpose. Whatever the news, small as well as great, write and tell me of it. I will on my side let nothing pass. </p>                        </div>

The first informed me of the scene in the theatre and at <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a>'s mime — a good sign of the unanimous feeling of the people at large. Indeed the applause given to Lucius <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> appeared to me even a trifle effusive. Your second letter was about our friend Bald-pate. He has no tendency to savage measures, as you imagine. For he has advanced, though not very far. I have been detained rather a long time by his talk: but as to what I told you in my last, perhaps I did put it obscurely. It was this. He said <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> remarked to him, on the occasion of my calling on him at the request of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> and having to sit waiting: Do you suppose I am such a fool as to think that this man, good-natured as he is, can like me, when he has to sit all this time waiting on my convenience? Well then, there is your Bald-pate bitterly opposed to the public peace, that is, to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>.

My vexation is that — as never happened before in any free state — the constitution has not been recovered along with liberty. It makes one shudder to hear their talk and their threats. Moreover, I am afraid of a rising in Gaul also, as well as of the line Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> may take. But come one, come all, the Ides of March console me. Moreover, our heroes, as far as anything decisive could be accomplished by their unaided efforts, accomplished it in the most glorious and most magnificent manner. The rest requires material resources and troops, neither of which we possess. So far I am giving you information: It is your turn now to send me — promptly anything fresh that occurs — for I expect something every day — and if there is nothing fresh, nevertheless let us keep up our habit of allowing no break in our interchange of notes.

Among good signs is Calvena's annoyance at being an object of suspicion to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. It will be a bad symptom if the legions come from Gaul with their ensigns. What think you as to those that were already in Spain — won't they make the same demands? As also those that <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> has taken across thither? I didn't mean <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a>, I meant to say C. <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a>. It was a slip of memory. A fine embroglio the Gambler has brought about! For that conspiracy of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s freedmen would have been easily put down, if <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had had his wits about him. How foolishly scrupulous I was not to accept a free legation before the vacation! I didn't wish to appear to shirk this ferment: for if it had been possible for me to remedy it, I should certainly have been bound to stick to my post. But you see what sort of magistrates we have — if magistrates they are to be called. You see, after all, the tyrant's hangers — on in enjoyment of imperium, you see his armies, his veterans on our flank! All these are materials easily fanned into a flame. While the men who ought not merely to be hedged round, but to be protected by the watchful care of all the world, you see merely made the objects of commendation and affection, but confined within the walls of their houses. Yet they — whatever their position — are happy. It is the state that is wretched. But I should like to know something about the arrival of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>. Is there a great flocking to visit him, any suspicion of a coup on his part? I don't expect it myself: still I should like to know the truth whatever it is.

First — you are better: second — you give better news. For that was a disquieting report about the legions coming. As for <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>, it is of no consequence. I want to hear about <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>: I thought he had been got rid of by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s conversation with our heroes is not unsatisfactory in the circumstances. But after all the only thing so far that gives me any pleasure is the Ides of March.

And in mentioning that instance I include a whole class of similar cases. For what can be more contemptible than that we should maintain the measures which caused us to detest him? Are we also to have the consuls and tribunes which he chooses for the next two years? I see no possibility of my taking part in the administration of affairs. For could there be a more flagrant solecism than that the tyrannicides should be exalted to the skies, the tyrant's administrative acts defended? But you see what sort of consuls and other magistrates we have — if they are to be called magistrates! You see the indifference of the loyalists. In the municipal towns they are jumping for joy. In fact I can't describe to you how rejoiced they are, how they flock to see me, how eager they are to hear me speak on the state of the Republic. Meanwhile, however, we can get no decrees out of the senate. The result of our policy is that we stand in awe of the conquered party. I write this to you after the dessert has been put on the table.

That is a duty on my part, and also concerns my reputation and position: which I perceive is your opinion also. Of course if I go to Greece in July, as is my present intention, everything will be easier; but as the present state of affairs makes it impossible to be sure of what is consistent with my honour, or within my power, or to my interest to do, pray make it your business to see that we give him an allowance on the most honourable and liberal scale.

You will of course make all that clear to me, as you have done everything else. I am not sorry that your slight attack of sickness has given you an excuse for taking a holiday; for as I read your letter I thought you had had a short rest. Always write and tell me everything about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, where he is, what he is thinking of doing. I do hope that by this time he is able even without a guard to wander in safety in any part of the city. But after all - </p>                        </div>

XIV, 9) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 18 APRIL: I have learnt a good deal about public affairs from your letters, a considerable batch of which I received at the same time from the freedman of <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>. However, to your questions I shall make a short answer. I must premise that I am delighted with the Cluvian estate. As to your question about the reason for my having sent for <a href=/people/186 target=_blank>Chrysippus</a> — two of my shops have fallen down and the rest are cracking. So not only the tenants but the very <a href=/people/10966 target=_blank>mice</a> have migrated. Other people call this a misfortune, I don't call it even a nuisance. Oh <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a> philosophers, I shall never be able to thank you enough! Good heavens, how paltry such things are in my eyes! But after all I am adopting a plan of building on the suggestion and advice of <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, which will convert this loss into a gain. Here there is a great crowd of visitors and there will, I hear, be a greater still. Our two consuls-designate forsooth! Good God, the tyranny survives though the tyrant is dead! We rejoice at his assassination, yet support his acts! Accordingly, M. <a href=/people/1555 target=_blank>Curtius</a> criticises us with such severity that one feels ashamed to be alive. And not without reason: for it had been better to die a thousand deaths than to endure the present state of things, which seems to me likely to be more than a passing phase. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> too is here and often at my house. He has had a letter from <a href=/people/3484 target=_blank>Vetus</a>, dated on the last day of the year, announcing that when he was investing <a href=/people/338 target=_blank>Caecilius</a> <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a>, and was on the point of compelling him to surrender, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=person long=58.5 lat=37>Parthian</a> <a href=/people/1270 target=_blank>Pacorus</a> arrived with an immense force: that accordingly <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a> was snatched from his hands, for which he blames <a href=/people/1683 target=_blank>Volcatius</a>. Accordingly, I think that a war there is imminent. But that will be the affair of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> and <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a>. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> also gives better news from Gaul. He has a letter dated twenty-one days back announcing that the Germans and the tribes there, on hearing about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s death, sent legates to <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a>, who was put in command by <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>, promising obedience. In short, everything speaks of peace in those parts, contrary to what Calvena said to me. </p>                        </div>

Is this all that our noble <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has accomplished — that he should have to live at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, and <a href=/people/951 target=_blank>Trebonius</a> should have to slink to his province by by-roads? That all the acts, memoranda, words, promises, and projects of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> should have more validity than if he were still alive? Do you remember that on that very first day of the retreat upon the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> I exclaimed that the senate should be summoned into the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitoline</a> temple? Good heavens, what might have been effected then, when all loyalists — even semi-loyalists — were exultant, and the brigands utterly dismayed! You lay the blame on the <a href=/people/7876 target=_blank>Liberalia</a>. What was possible at the time? Our case had long been hopeless. Do you remember that you explained that it was all over with us, if he were allowed a funeral? But he was even burnt in the forum, and a funeral oration was pronounced over him in moving terms, and a number of slaves and starvelings instigated to attack our houses with firebrands. What next! They even have the impudence to say: You utter a word against the will of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>? These and other things like them I cannot endure, and accordingly I am thinking of wandering away from land to land. Your land, however, is too much in the eye of the wind. Is your sickness quite gone by this time? I rather judged so from the tone of your letter. I return to the case of the veterans-your Tebassi, Scaevae, and Frangones. Do you suppose these men feel any confidence in retaining their grants so long as our party have any footing in the state? They have found it possessed of more resolution than they expected. They, I presume, are devoted to the cause of public tranquillity rather than supporters of robbery! But when I wrote to you about <a href=/people/6401 target=_blank>Curtilius</a> and the estate of <a href=/people/2785 target=_blank>Sextilius</a>, I must be understood to have included <a href=/people/2605 target=_blank>Censorinus</a>, <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a>, <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a>, and the whole lot. It had been better to have risked destruction — which would never have befallen us — when <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was killed, rather than to have lived to see this sort of thing. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a> on the 18th of April. There <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> called on him early next day, and on the same day came to see me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, with the information that he intended to accept the inheritance, but that, as you say, there will be a fine scrimmage with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. Your business about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> is receiving, as it is bound to do, and will continue to receive my attention. You ask me whether <a href=/people/2154 target=_blank>Cluvius</a>'s legacy is reaching one hundred sestertia yet. It seems to be approaching that. At least I made eighty the first year. My brother Quintus writes to me with heavy complaints of his son, chiefly because he is now taking his mother's part, whereas in old times when she was kind to him he was on bad terms with her. He sent me a very hot letter against him. If you know what the young man is doing, and have not yet left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, I wish you would write me word, and, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, on any other matter besides.

I only wish to heaven <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> would stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414128UAst class=place long=12.7653 lat=41.4089>Astura</a>. You mention the intemperance of the Caesarians. Did you expect anything else? For my part, I look for worse things. For when I read his speech Concerning so great a man, Concerning a most illustrious citizen, I can scarcely contain myself; yet all that sort of thing is now really ludicrous. But remember this: the habit of delivering unprincipled speeches is being fostered to such a pitch that our — I won't say heroes — our gods, while sure of eternal glory, will yet not escape prejudice or even danger. They, however, have a great consolation in the consciousness of a most magnificent and noble deed: what consolation is there for us, who, though the tyrant is slain, are not free? But let fortune look to this, since reason is not at the helm. What you say about my son is very gratifying — God bless him! I am exceedingly obliged to you for arranging that he should have an allowance ample for the amenities as well as the necessaries of life; and I emphatically beg you to continue to do so. About the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> your idea is quite right. I am not losing sight of that affair. I will undertake to plead the entire case, and I perceive that it daily grows simpler. As to the Cluvian inheritance, since in all business of mine you even surpass me in interest — I may tell you that the total is approaching one hundred-sestertia. The fall of the houses did not depreciate the value of the property: I am not sure that it didn't increase it. I have here with me <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>, and <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>. <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> has lately arrived at the next villa to mine, that of <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a>.

XIV, 12) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 22 APRIL: Ah, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, I fear the Ides of March have brought us nothing beyond exultation, and the satisfaction of our anger and resentment. What news reaches me from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>! What things are going on here under my eyes! Yes, it was a fine piece of work, but inconclusive after all! You know how fond I am of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a>, and what an honour I consider it to be their patron. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> granted them many privileges with my full approval, though their having the ius Latinum was intolerable; yet, after all — But look at <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>! For an enormous bribe he has put up a law — alleged to have been Carried at the comitia by the dictator, granting the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=ethnic long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilians</a> full Roman citizenship; though while he was alive there was never a word said about it. Again: take the case of my client <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>, isn't it exactly parallel? He, of course, deserved any kingdom you please, but not through <a href=/people/821 target=_blank>Fulvia</a>. There are hundreds of similar cases. However, I come back to this: shall I not be able to maintain in some degree the case of Buthrotium — a case so clear, so fully supported by witnesses, and so intrinsically just? And indeed all the more so that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> is being so lavish in his grants? <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> here treats me with great respect and friendliness. His own people addressed him as <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, but <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> did not, so I did not do so either. I declare that it is impossible for him to be a good citizen. He is surrounded by such a number of people, who even threaten our friends with death. He says the present state of things is unendurable. But what do you think of it, when a boy like that goes to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, where our liberators cannot be in safety. They indeed will always be illustrious, and even happy, from the consciousness of their great deed. But for us, unless I am mistaken, we shall be ruined. Therefore I long to leave the country and go Where of the <a href=/people/2179 target=_blank>Pelopidae</a>, etc. I don't like even these consuls-designate, who have actually forced me to give them some declamations, to prevent my having any rest even at the seaside. But that's what I get by being too good-natured. For in old times declamation was in a manner a necessity of my existence: now, however things turn out, it is not so. For what a long time now have I had nothing to write to you about! Yet I do write, not to give you any pleasure by this letter, but to extract one from you. Pray write on every sort of thing, but anyhow about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, whatever there is to say. I write this on the 22nd of April, while dining with <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>, a man who has no idea of philosophy, but is well versed in figures. </p>                        </div>

ANTONIUS TO CICERO (AT PUTEOLI) SOUTH ITALY, ABOUT 24 APRIL: I was prevented by my engagements, and by your own sudden departure from town, from mentioning to you a request by word of mouth, which I fear will have less weight in your eyes owing to its not being personally presented. But if your liberality answers to the opinion which I have always entertained of you I shall rejoice. I asked <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> for the restoration of Sextus <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>. I obtained my request. It was in my mind even at the time only to avail myself of the favour if you did not object. I am therefore the more anxious to be allowed to do it now with your acquiescence. But if you show yourself sternly inclined towards his distressing and ruinous position, I will not contest the matter with you though I consider myself bound to carry out a minute of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s. But, by <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, if you are inclined to take a large-hearted philosophical and kindly view of my proceedings, you will certainly show your good nature and will wish P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, a boy of very great promise, to feel that you have not been inveterate to his father's friends. I beg you to suffer it to be seen that you quarrelled with his father on public grounds only. Of this family you can have no reason for thinking meanly. It is of course more to our honour, and more agreeable to our feelings, to give up quarrels undertaken on public grounds than those that are the result of personal prejudice. Let me then at once lead the youth to think and be convinced, while his mind is young and impressionable, that enmities are not to be transmitted to another generation. Although your fortunes, my dear <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, are now, I feel assured, removed from every danger, nevertheless I think you would prefer spending a peaceful and honoured old age rather than one full of anxiety. Finally, I claim a right to ask this favour of you myself; for I have omitted nothing that I could do for your sake. But if I don't obtain it I shall not make this grant to <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> as far as I am concerned, in order that you may understand what weight your authority has with me, and may on that account show yourself all the more placable. </p>                        </div>

ANTONIUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 26 APRIL: THE request you make to me by letter I have only one reason for wishing that you had made personally. For in that case you would have been able to perceive my affection for you not merely by my language, but from my expression, eyes, and brow — as the phrase goes. For while I have always loved you — incited thereto at first by your zeal in my service and then by your actual favours — so in these times the interests of the state have so recommended me to you, that there is no one whom I regard with warmer affection. Moreover, the very affectionate and complimentary tone of your letter had such an effect upon me that I felt as though I were not doing you a favour, but receiving one from you, when you qualified your request by an assurance that you would not restore a personal enemy of mine, who was a friend of your own, if I did not wish it, though you could have done so without any trouble. Of course, my dear <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, I give you my free consent, besides acknowledging that by expressing yourself as you have done you have treated me with the utmost liberality and courtesy. And while I should have thought it my duty to have granted what you ask without reserve, whatever the circumstances, I now grant it as a concession to my own feelings and inclination. For I never had a spark, I won't' say of bitterness, in me, but even of sternness or severity beyond what the service of the state required. I may add that even against <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> himself my exasperation has never been extravagant, and I have always held that the friends of my enemies were not proper objects for attack, especially those in a lower position of life. Nor ought we ourselves to be deprived of such supporters. As for the boy <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, I think it is your duty to imbue what you call his young and impressionable mind with the conviction that no vindictive feelings remain between our families. I fought P. <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, since I was supporting the interests of the state, he his own. Upon the merits of our controversies the state has decided. If he were now alive, I should have had no cause of contention with him remaining. Wherefore, since you put this request to me with the reservation that you will not avail yourself of what is undoubtedly within your power against my wishes, please grant this to the boy also as a present from me, if you think it right. Not because a man of my age need suspect any danger from a boy of his, nor because a man in my position has reason to shrink from any controversy, but that we may be still more closely united than we have as yet been: for owing to the intervention of these feuds your heart has been more open to me than your house. But enough of this. I will only add, that I shall always zealously do without hesitation whatever I think to be your wish and to your advantage. </p>                        </div>

In it you ask me (and even seem to think I can't answer) which of the two I like best-hills and a fine view or a walk along a flat coast. Well, it is quite true that, as you say, the charm of both spots is so great, that I can't make up my mind which is to be preferred.  But 'tis no time to think of dainty fare, When heaven upon us rolls this cloud of woe: We look and shudder — is it life or death?  For though you have sent me important and welcome news about <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a> having joined his legions, in which I see the promise of very great things. Nevertheless, if there is to be a civil war, as there is sure to be, if Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> is going to remain in arms — as I know for certain he will — what I am to do I am at loss to conceive. For it will not be allowable now, as it was in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s war, to go neither to the one nor to the other. For anyone that this party shall believe to have rejoiced at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s death — and we all of us showed our joy in the most open way — they will consider in the light of a public enemy: and that means a formidable massacre. The only resource is to go to the camp of Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> or perhaps to that of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. It is a tiresome step and quite unsuitable to our time of life, Considering the uncertainty of war, and somehow or another I can say to you and you to me: "My son, the deeds of war are not for you: Seek rather thou the witching works of — speech. But I will leave all this to chance, which in such matters is more powerful than design. For ourselves let us only take care — a thing which is within our power — that we bear whatever happens with courage and philosophy, remember that we are but mortal, and allow literature to console us much, but the Ides of March most of all. Now join me in the deliberation which is distracting my mind, owing to the many conflicting arguments which occur to me on either side. Shall I start for Greece, as I had determined, with a libera legatio? Thereby I seem to avoid a considerable risk of impending massacre, but to be likely to expose myself to some reproach for having deserted the state at such a grave crisis. If on the other hand I remain, I perceive that I shall be in danger indeed, but I suspect that an opportunity may occur of my being able to benefit the republic. There is also a consideration of a private nature, namely, that I think it of great importance for confirming my son in his good resolutions that I should go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and I had no other motive for my journey at the time when I contemplated accepting a libera legatio from <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. Therefore pray take under your consideration the whole question, as you always do in anything which you think touches my interests. Now I return to your letter. You say that there are rumours that I am about to sell my property on the Lake; while I am going to convey my bijou villa — and that at a fancy price — to my brother Quintus, for him to bring home, as young Quintus has told you, the rich heiress <a href=/people/7269 target=_blank>Aquilia</a>. The real truth is that I have no thoughts of selling unless I find something that pleases me better; while Quintus has no idea of purchasing at this time. He is quite bothered enough by his obligation to repay the dowry. To marriage, moreover, he has such a distaste that he assures me that nothing can be pleasanter than a bed to oneself. But enough of that. I return to the downcast or rather to the non-existent republic. Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> has written to me about the recall of Sextus <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> — in what a complimentary manner, as far as I am concerned, you may see from his letter, for I am sending you a copy. But you will at the same time have no difficulty in recognizing the unprincipled and improper nature of his proposal, — so mischievous in fact that it sometimes makes one wish <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> back again. For measures which <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would never have taken or sanctioned are now produced from his forged minutes. However, I made no difficulty about it to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>: for of course, having once made up his mind that he may do what he chooses, he would have done it all the same if I had refused. So I inclose a copy of my letter also. </p>                        </div>

XIV, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 27 APRIL: Oh tell me o'er your tale again. Our nephew Quintus at the <a href=/people/3225 target=_blank>Parilia</a> wearing a garland? Was he alone? You certainly mention <a href=/people/694 target=_blank>Lamia</a> also, which does utterly astonish me, but I am eager to know who the others were: although I am quite sure that there was no one that wasn't a traitor. Please therefore make this clearer. For myself, it chanced that I had just despatched a fairly long letter to you on the 26th, when about three hours later I received yours, which was also very bulky. So I needn't write to tell you that I had a hearty laugh over your witty and amusing remarks about <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>'s sect and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> an custom of the Pheriones. Now about things more political. You defend the two <a href=/people/4902 target=_blank>Brutuses</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> as though I were finding fault with them: whereas the fact is I cannot praise them enough. lt was the weak points in the situation, not in the individuals, that I reviewed. For though the tyrant has been removed, I see that the tyranny remains. For instance, things which <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> never intended to do are being done: as in the case of <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> — in regard to which I have full assurance not only that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was not likely to have done it himself, but that he would have actually forbidden it. The next will be <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>'s old foe <a href=/people/8250 target=_blank>Rufio</a>, Victor whose name was never in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s minutes, and so on with the rest — who shall we not see restored? We could not endure being his slaves; we are the humble servants of his memorandum books. As to the senate of the 17th of March — who was strong enough to refuse to attend? Suppose that could somehow have been done: when I did attend, could I possibly speak with freedom? Wasn't it on every ground necessary, seeing that I had nothing to protect me, to speak up for the veterans who were there with arms in their hands? You can bear me witness that I never approved of that lingering on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>. Well, was that the fault of the <a href=/people/4902 target=_blank>Brutuses</a>? Not at all, but of those other dull brutes, who think themselves cautious and wise, who thought it enough in some cases to rejoice, in others to congratulate, in none to persevere. But let us leave the past: let us bestow all our care and power of protection on our heroes, and, as you advise, let us be content with the Ides of March. Yet though they gave our friends — those inspired heroes — an entrance to heaven, they have not given the Roman people liberty. Recall your own words. Don't you remember exclaiming that all was lost if <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had a public funeral? Wisely said! Accordingly, you see what has been the issue of it. So you say that on the 1st of June <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> means to bring the allotment of provinces before the senate, and to propose taking the Gauls himself. Well, will the senate be free to pass a decree? If it is, then I shall rejoice that liberty has been recovered. If not, what will that change of masters have brought me except the joy with which I feasted my eyes on the just execution of a tyrant? You mention plundering going on at the temple of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Ops</a>. I, too, was a witness to that at the time. Yes in truth, we have been freed by heroic champions with the result that we are not free after all! So theirs is the glory, ours the fault. And do you advise me to write history? To record the outrageous crimes of the men by whom we are still held down? Shall I be able to refrain from complimenting those very persons, who have asked you to act as their witness? And it isn't, by heaven, the petty gain that moves me; but it is painful to attack with invectives men who have shown me personal goodwill, whatever their character. However, as you say, I shall be able to determine my whole line of conduct with greater clearness by the 1st of June. I shall attend on that day and shall strive by every means and exertion in my power — with the assistance of your influence and popularity and the essential justice of the cause — to get a decree through the senate about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> in the sense of your letter. The plan of which you bid me think I will of course think over, though I had already in my previous letter Commended it to your consideration. But here are you seeking — just as though the Constitution were already recovered — to give back their just rights to your neighbours of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/433054PMas class=place long=5.36 lat=43.3>Marseilles</a>. These rights may possibly be restored to them by arms — though I do not know how far we can rely on them — they cannot be so by anybody's influence. P.S. The short letter written by you afterwards was very agreeable to me — that about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, and also his to you. It seems possible that things may be better than they have been hitherto. But I must take measures as to my present position and as to where to go immediately. </p>                        </div>

It is indeed a notable achievement-execution from the rock, on the cross, removal of the column, the contract given out for paving the whole spot. In short-positively heroic! He seems to me to have put an end to that artificial pretence of regret, which up to this time was daily growing, and which, if it became deeply rooted, I feared might prove dangerous to our tyrannicides. As it is, I entirely agree with your letter and hope for better things: though I cannot stand those people who, while pretending to desire peace, defend unprincipled proceedings: but we can't have everything at once. Things are beginning to go better than I had expected: and of course I will not leave the country till you think I may do so with honour. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> certainly I will always be ready to serve at any time or place, and that I should have done, even if there were no ties between us, for the sake of his unparalleled and extraordinary character.

XIV, 16) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 3 MAY: I despatch this letter on the 3rd of May, when on the point of embarking on a rowing boat from the Cluvian pleasure-grounds, after having handed over to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> my villa on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141WLuc class=place long=14.08 lat=40.8292>Lucrine lake</a>, its servants, and bailiffs. I myself on that day am threatening the cheese-and-sardine dishes of my friend <a href=/people/1226 target=_blank>Paetus</a>. In a very few days I shall go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>, and afterwards shall return to my domains at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>. What desirable spots in other respects, yet owing to the crowd of visitors almost to be shunned! But to come to business. What a gallant coup de main of my <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>! What a magnificent display! For my part I never cease mingling praise and exhortation in writing to him. Yes, you are quite right in the opinion you express in all your letters about the action as well as the man. In my opinion our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> might walk through the forum even with a gold crown on his head. For who would venture to assault him with the fear of the cross and the rock before their eyes? Especially as this transaction has been so loudly cheered and so heartily approved by the very mob? Now, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, do make things all right for me. I want, as soon as I have done fully all that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> requires of me, to make an excursion into Greece. It is much to my son's interest, or rather to mine, or by heaven to that of us both, that I should drop in upon him in his studies. For in the letter of <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> which you forwarded to me, what is there, after all, to give us any great pleasure? I shall never think the boy's report satisfactory while it contains such a phrase as as he is going on at present. These are not the words of confidence, but rather of anxiety. Moreover, I had charged <a href=/people/1266 target=_blank>Herodes</a> to write to me in detail; but as yet I have not had a line from him. I fear he had nothing to say which he thought would be pleasant for me to know. I am much obliged to you for having written to <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a>. It concerns my duty as well as my reputation that my son should not be in any way short of means. I hear that <a href=/people/504 target=_blank>Flaminius</a> <a href=/people/4530 target=_blank>Flamma</a> is at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. I have written to tell him that I have given you a written commission to speak to him about the business of <a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a>. Please see that the letter I have sent him is delivered, and — if quite convenient to yourself — have a personal interview with him. I think, if there is a spark of shame in the man, he will see that the payment is not deferred to my loss. As to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> you have done me a great kindness in seeing that I knew of her recovery before I knew that she had been unwell. </p>                        </div>

CORNELIUS DOLABELLA POMPEII, 3 MAY: Though I am quite content, my dear <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, with the glory you have earned, and feel it to be a source of great exultation and pleasure, yet I Cannot help confessing that it adds a finishing stroke to my joy that popular opinion associates my name with your praises. I meet a great many people every day, for large numbers of men of rank are collected in this district for their health, besides a goodly crowd of friends of mine from the country towns. Well, I have met none who did not with one consent praise you to the skies, adding in the same breath a very warm expression of thanks to me. For they say that they have no doubt that it is in obedience to my precepts and advice that you are showing yourself to be a most eminent citizen and brilliant consul. Though I can answer such men with the most absolute truth that what you are doing you do on your own judgment and your own initiative, and do not need any man's advice, yet I neither admit outright the truth of their remark, lest I should detract from your glory by making it Seem to have sprung entirely from my advice, nor do I deny it entirely either. For I am even too covetous of honour. And, after all, it is no disparagement to your dignity — as it was not to that of <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> himself the king of kings — to have some <a href=/people/125 target=_blank>Nestor</a> to assist you in forming your plans. Whereas it redounds to my glory that as still a young man you should have a brilliant reputation as a Consul while being, so to speak, a pupil of my school. Lucius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, for instance, when I visited him on his sick bed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, though racked with pains all over his body, scarcely got the formal words of greeting out of his mouth before he exclaimed: Oh my dear <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>, I congratulate you on having an influence with <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, such as if I had had with my sister's son, we might now have been safe. Your <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> indeed I both congratulate and thank — for he is the only man since your consulship that I can with any truth call a consul. Then he proceeded to say a great deal about the occurrence, and how you had managed the affair, declaring that no more splendid and brilliant act had ever been done, nor one more beneficial to the state. And this was the observation of everyone. Now, I beg of you to allow me to accept this quasi-inheritance, so to speak, of another man's glory, and to permit me to some extent to be a sharer in your reputation. However, my dear <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> — for this is only my joke — it would give me greater pleasure to divert the full stream of my glories, if I may be said to have any, upon you, than to draw off any part of yours. For while I have always had the warm attachment to you which you have had every opportunity of appreciating, by your recent acts I have been so inflamed that nothing can exceed the ardour of my attachment. For there is nothing, believe me, fairer, more beautiful, or more attractive than virtue. I have always, as you know, loved Marcus <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> for his eminent ability, his very agreeable manners, and unequalled honesty and consistency. Nevertheless, on the Ides of March my affection was so much enhanced, that I was surprised to find an addition possible in what I had looked upon as having long ago reached its height. Who could have thought that any addition was possible to my affection for you? Yet so great an addition has been made that I seem to myself never to have loved before, only to have liked. Wherefore what need to exhort you to support your position and reputation? Shall I quote to you the examples of illustrious men, as people usually do when exhorting another. I have none to quote more illustrious than yourself. You must imitate yourself, vie with yourself. It is not even admissible after such great achievements for you to fail to be like yourself. This being so, exhortation is superfluous. What is called for is rather congratulation. For it has been your good fortune — as I think it has never been anyone else's — to inflict the most severe punishment, not only without exciting ill feeling, but with full popular approval, and to the greatest and most universal satisfaction of aristocrat and plebeian alike. If this were merely a stroke of luck in your case I should have congratulated your good fortune; but it is in fact the result of a certain largeness of spirit, ability, and prudence. For I read your speech. It was wisdom itself. So well did you feel your way in first approaching and then avoiding the points of the case, that by universal consent the time for striking the blow seemed naturally to arise from the facts. So you have freed the city from danger and the state from terrorism, and not only done a useful service in view of the present emergency, but have set a precedent. Wherefore you ought to understand that the constitution depends on you, and that you are bound not only to protect, but to honour the men who laid the foundation of liberty. But of such matters at greater length when we meet, which I hope will be soon. For you, my dear <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, since you are preserving the Republic and us, take care to guard your own life with every possible precaution. </p>                        </div>

XIV, 17) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) POMPEII, 3 MAY: I arrived at my Pompeian villa on the 3rd of May, having on the day before — as I wrote to tell you — established <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> in my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>. There, as I was at dinner, the letter was put into my hands which you had delivered to your freedman <a href=/people/32 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> on the 30th of April. It contained much that was wise; still, as you remarked yourself, you had to allow that every plan depended entirely on fortune. Therefore on these matters we will consult on the spot and when we meet. As to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=demonym long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotian</a> business, I wish to heaven I could have an interview with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>! I am sure I should effect a great deal. But people think he won't budge from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, whither I fear he has gone for a purpose very mischievous to the state. Lucius <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was of this opinion also, whom I saw yesterday in a very bad state of health at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. So I shall have to raise a debate on this subject and settle it on the 1st of June. But enough of this. The younger Quintus has written a very unpleasant letter to his father, which was delivered to him on our arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>. The chief point, however, was that he would not put up with <a href=/people/7269 target=_blank>Aquilia</a> as a stepmother. Perhaps that was excusable. But what do you think of his saying that he had hitherto owed everything to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, nothing to his father, and for the future looked to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>? What an abandoned rascal! But we'll see to it. I have written letters to our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, to <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, and <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>. I send you copies; not that I hesitate as to whether they should be delivered — for I am clearly of opinion that they should be, and I have no doubt that you will be of the same opinion. Pray, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, supply my son with as much as you think right, and allow me to impose this burden upon you. All you have done up to the present time has been exceedingly acceptable to me. My unpublished book I have not yet polished up to my satisfaction. The additional matter which you wish introduced must wait for a second volume of some kind. I think, however — and I would have you believe me when I say so — that it was safer to attack that abominable party while the tyrant was alive than now that he is dead. For in a manner he was surprisingly tolerant of me. Now, whichever way we turn, we are confronted not merely by <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s enactments, but also by those which he merely contemplated. Since <a href=/people/4530 target=_blank>Flamma</a> has arrived, please see about <a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a>. I think the business should be on a better footing. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.14.19'><b>&sect; Att.14.19</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;DCCXXII (Att. XIV, 19) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) POMPEII, 8 MAY: Being in my Pompeian villa on the 7th of May I received two letters from you, the first dated five days ago, the second three. I will therefore answer the earlier one first. How glad I am that Barnaeus delivered my letter at the nick of time! Yes, with <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> as before. It is, however, a lucky coincidence that I had just done what you advise me to do. Five days ago I wrote to him and sent you a copy of my letter. But after I had been thrown into a great state of despair by <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s avarice — to use your expression — lo and behold, arrives a letter from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and one from you. He is meditating exile: I, however, see before me a different port, and one better suited to my time of life. Though, of course, I should prefer entering it with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> in prosperity and the constitution on a sound footing. As it is indeed, you are right in saying that we have now no choice in the matter. For you agree with me that my age is unsuitable to a camp, especially in a civil war. Marcus <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antonius</a> merely said about <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a>, in answer to my letter, that my leniency and placability had been very gratifying to him, and would be a source of great pleasure to myself. But <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> seems to be fuming about <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> as well as about <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a>. His words are stern enough, if you choose to believe them. Nevertheless, he is not sound — as I think — on the subject of- <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s achievement, of which he loudly expresses His disapproval. As to the men with the garlands, when your sister's son was reproved by his father, he wrote back to say that he had worn a garland in honour of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, that he had laid it aside as a sign of mourning; lastly, that he was quite content to be vilified for loving <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> even when dead. To <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> I have written cordially, as you said that you thought I ought to do. I have also done so to <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>. I don't lay the responsibility of this upon you: I don't want you to incur his wrath. I recognize <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>'s style of talk, in which I see more of timidity than wisdom. But since we have all been frightened out of our wits, I have nothing to say against <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a> has taken you in. For <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a> was sent here by them as their envoy; but I convinced her without difficulty that what she asked was not even legal, to say nothing of my disliking it. If I see <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> I will seriously press the case of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>. I come now to your later letter, though I have already answered you in regard to <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a>. You say that I am making a good deal of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s achievement. Well, by heaven, it is my genuine opinion that it could not be surpassed in the circumstances and actual state of affairs. But after all, whatever credit I give him is founded on what you wrote. However, I agree with you that it would be a still greater achievement on his part, if he paid me what he owes me. I should like <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> to stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414128UAst class=place long=12.7653 lat=41.4089>Astura</a>. You praise me for coming to no decision about leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> till I see how affairs at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> are likely to turn out. But I have changed my mind about that. I shall not, however, do anything till I have seen you. I am pleased that our dear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> thanks me for what I have done for her mother. I have in fact put the whole villa and store-room at her service, and am thinking of going to see her on the 11th. Please give my love to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. I will take good care of <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>. </p>                        </div>

XIV, 18) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) POMPEII, 9 MAY: You are always going on at me for what you consider my extravagance in praising <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s achievement to the skies. Now, though I do highly approve of what he did, I was after all led to speak of it in such high terms by first one and then another letter from you. But <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> has entirely lost your favour for the same reason which has made me very bitter with him too. A brazen-faced fellow indeed! He should have paid on the 1st of January: he has not paid yet, and that though he has freed himself from a vast load of debt by the handwriting of <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>, and has sought an opening in the temple of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Ops</a>. For a pun is permissible, lest you should think me very much upset. And, in fact, I wrote to him very early in the morning of the 8th. On the same day I received a letter from you at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> — which had travelled very quickly, for it reached me on the third day. But, as I wrote you word on that very day, I sent <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> a fairly stinging letter. Even if that does no good, I think he will at any rate be unable to face me when we meet. I think you have settled the business of <a href=/people/3526 target=_blank>Albius</a>. As to the debt from <a href=/people/10011 target=_blank>Patulcius</a>, your having come to my aid is most kind, and exactly like everything you are always doing. But I seem to have deserted <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, who is the very man to settle that business, for it was owing to his serious mistake that they went wrong in their accounts. But I will see to that when I meet him. As to <a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a>, as I have often mentioned to you before, you will please see to the whole business. I am not at all surprised that <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> spoke to you in a tone of despair as he was leaving town, and I am not a whit behind him in his despairing view of the situation. What our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, that unequalled hero, is going to do in the forum, if he does not intend to come to the senate on the 1st of June, I cannot imagine. But he will settle that himself better than I can. Judging from the measures I see in course of preparation, I conclude that little good was done by the Ides of March. Accordingly, I think of going to Greece more and more every day. For I don't see what good I can do my friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, who — as he writes me word — is contemplating exile for himself. The letter of <a href=/people/1837 target=_blank>Leonides</a> did not give me much pleasure. About <a href=/people/1266 target=_blank>Herodes</a> I agree with you. I could wish I had read that of <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a>. I am thinking of leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> on the 10th of May. </p>                        </div>

On disembarking I received your letter which your letter-Carrier is said to have taken to my house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>, dated the 7th of May. Next day, leaving <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, I arrived at my house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> about the same hour. There I found two letters from you, one dated the 7th, the other the 9th. So now take my answer to all three. First, thank you for what you have done on my behalf both as to the payment and the business with <a href=/people/3526 target=_blank>Albius</a>. Next, as to your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>. When I was at my Pompeian villa, <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenum</a>: but left it for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a> before I heard of his arrival. You must not build too much hope on him. Accordingly, I shall have to see to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. L. <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>'s speech — shocking! <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s — famous! By all means let him keep his money, so long as he pays on the Ides. I am sorry for dear Tertia's miscarriage: we want as many <a href=/people/7445 target=_blank>Cassii</a> produced as <a href=/people/4100 target=_blank>Bruti</a>. I wish it may be true about the Queen and that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of hers. I have answered your first letter: I now come to your second. I will see to the Quinti and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> when I come, as you say. Thank you for supplying my son. You think me mistaken in my idea that the constitution depends on <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. The truth is that it will all go or will be saved by him and his friends. You urge me to send you a written copy of a speech to the people. Well, here, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, you may take it from me as a general maxim applicable to the affairs in which we have had a fairly wide experience — no one whether poet or orator, ever yet thought anyone else better than himself. This is the case even with bad ones. What can you expect of the brilliant and accomplished <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. I had actual experience of him recently in the matter of the edict. I drafted one on your request. I liked mine, he his. Nay, more, when in answer to what I may almost call his entreaties I had dedicated my book On the best Style of Oratory to him, he wrote not only to me, but to you also, to say that he did not agree with my choice of style. Wherefore, pray, let each man write for himself: Each man has the best of wives: So have I. That you have a sweeter love, I deny. It is not well put, for it is by <a href=/people/585 target=_blank>Atilius</a>, the most wooden of poets. And I only hope he may be allowed to deliver a speech at all! If he can but show himself in the city with safety, it will be a triumph for us. For if he sets up as a leader in a new civil war, no one will follow him, or only such as can be easily beaten. Now for your third letter. I am glad that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> liked my letter. Accordingly, I have written back to them. They want <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> made a better citizen by my influence. Well, I am doing my best, and his language is very satisfactory, but he passes his time and almost shares houses with <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, who also uses loyalist language. What to believe of that I must leave you to determine. I see that you are much pleased with <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>; I am eminently so. I saw a good deal of <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>. He quite convinced me of the soundness of his views and his desire for peace. I can see plainly that a pretext for war is being sought. I quite approve of the edict of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. You wish me to turn over in my mind what course I think they ought to take. We must adapt our plans to circumstances, which you see change every hour. <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> seems to me to have done a great deal of good both by that first move of his and by this speech against <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a>. Certainly there is progress. Now, too, we seem likely to have a leader; which is the one thing the country towns and loyal citizens want. Do you allude to <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> and venture to quote: Engage not in politics ? Does not the frown of our <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> warn you off from such talk? The younger Quintus, as you say, is <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s right hand. By his means, therefore, we shall get what we want. I am anxious to hear, in case Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> has introduced <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a> to a public meeting, as you think he will, what kind of speech he has made. I can add no more, for <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s letter-carrier is just about to start. I am going directly to call on <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>; thence to dinner with <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a> by boat.

XIV, 21) TO ATTICUS (AT LANUVIUM) PUTEOLI (AT THE TABLE OF VESTORIUS), I I MAY: Only a little while ago I had sent you a letter by <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s letter-carrier, when my own letter-carrier arrived on the 11th, and, marvellous to say, without a letter from you. But I soon concluded that you had been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, however, made great haste to have <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s letter delivered to me. It was not about my money — for he had not received my letter: but he wrote in answer to the letter of which I sent you a copy. It was very well expressed. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a>, however, came to see me immediately after I had despatched <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s letter-carrier. Good heavens! how plainly he showed his dread of peace! You know, too, what a reserved fellow he is, yet he told me <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s plans. That he was making the round of the veterans, to induce them to confirm <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s acta, and to take an oath that they would do so; to secure that they all had arms; and that two commissioners should inspect them every month. He also grumbled about the prejudice existing against himself, and his whole conversation indicated an affection for <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. In a word, there is nothing sound about him. For my part, I feel certain that things have a warlike look. For that deed was done with the courage of men, but the imprudence of a child. For who can fail to see that an heir to the tyranny has been left? Now what can be more irrational than To fear the one, nor dread at all the other? Nay, at this very moment there are many circumstances of a paradoxical character. What about the mother of the tyrannicide retaining the Neapolitan villa of <a href=/people/1756 target=_blank>Pontius</a>? I must read over again and again my <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> Maior, which is dedicated to you. For old age is spoiling my temper. Everything puts me in a rage. But for me life is over. The rising generation must look to it. Take care of my affairs, as you always do. I write, or rather dictate this, after the dessert has been put on the table at the house of <a href=/people/1601 target=_blank>Vestorius</a>. Tomorrow I am thinking of dining with <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> — the sole survivor indeed of our set of five. That is my way of bringing him Over to the Optimates. It is all nonsense: for there is not one of that party who does not dread a period of peace. Wherefore let us look out our winged-sandals! For I prefer anything to a camp. Pray give my best love to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>. I am anxious to hear of <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>'s speech and anything else, but specially whether <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> has the true money chink, or has gone in for repudiation in regard to my debt also. </p>                        </div>

First then I want you to know that I am leaving this place for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> on the 17th of May. So please direct there if there is anything to write after this: though I shall be with you almost immediately myself. For I am anxious that before I arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> very careful inquiry should be made as to what is going to happen. However, I fear that my presentiments are not wide of the mark. It is in truth quite plain what these fellows are at. For my pupil, who dines with me today, is much devoted to the victim of our <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s dagger: and if you ask my opinion, I see very plainly their attitude — they dread peace. Moreover, their constant theme is that a man of the most illustrious character has been killed: that by his death the constitution has been thoroughly shaken: that his acta will be rendered nugatory as soon as we cease to be frightened: that his clemency did him harm; and that if he had not shown it, nothing of the sort would have befallen him. It strikes me therefore, that if <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> arrives with a strong army — as is reasonable to expect — there will certainly be war. This idea haunts my imagination and terrifies me. For we shall not now be able to do what you did on the former occasion. For I made no secret of my triumphant joy. In the next place, they talk of our ingratitude. It certainly will be impossible for me on any grounds to take up the position which was then possible for you and many others. Must I then put a good face on it and go to the camp? A thousand times better die, especially at my time of life. Accordingly, the Ides of March do not console me so much as they did: for they involve a serious blunder, unless our young heroes By other noble deeds wipe out this shame. But if you have any brighter hope as being more in the way of hearing news and being cognizant of their plans, pray write me word and at the same time turn over in your mind what I ought to do about taking a votive legation. The fact is that in these parts many warn me against appearing in the senate on the 1st of June. Troops are said to be secretly collecting for that day, and that too against the men who seem to me likely to be safer anywhere than in the senate. </p>                        </div>

For what need have I of a physician? Or if I do need one, is there such a dearth of them? It is his affection for me, his culture, his gracious manners that I miss. Then there is this consideration — what is there that we may not fear when a man of such temperate habits, of such eminence as a physician, is carried off by such a sudden illness? But to all such thoughts the only consolation is that the conditions of our birth forbid us to shrink from anything to which flesh is heir.

For he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141HMis class=place long=14.0847 lat=40.7874>Misenum</a> while I was at my Pompeian house, and left it before I knew of his arrival. But, as it happened, <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> was with me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> when I was reading your letter. I read it out to him and stated the case. As at first advised he would make no concession. At last, however, he said that I should be judge, not only in this matter but of the whole of his administration as consul. With <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> again I will put the case in such a way as to make him perceive that, if he does what we want in that business, I shall be wholly his in the future. I hope <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> is in town. Let us return to our heroes, of whom you show that you have good hopes owing to the moderate tone of their edicts. Now, when <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> left my house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> on the 16th of May for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>, to visit <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>, I had a clear view of his whole mind. For I took him aside and exhorted him earnestly to preserve the peace. He could not of course say that he did not wish for peace: but he indicated that he was no less afraid of our side appealing to arms than of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> doing so: and that after all both sides had reason to be on their guard, but that he feared the arms of both. I needn't go on: there is nothing sound about him. As to the younger Quintus, I agree with you: at any rate your charming letter to him gave the greatest pleasure to his father. <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a>, indeed, I had no difficulty in convincing. She did not seem to me to be very anxious for it, and if she had been, I certainly should not have done so. As to the lady whom you say has been troublesome to you, I am quite surprised that you listened to her at all. For because I spoke in complimentary terms of her in the presence of friends and in the hearing of her three sons, and your daughter, does the rest follow? What is the point of — Why should I pace the streets with features masked? Isn't the mask of old age itself ugly enough? You say that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> asks me to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> before the 1st. He has written to me to the same effect, and perhaps I will do so. But I don't at all know why he wishes it. For what advice can I offer him, when I am at a loss what plan to adopt myself, and when he has done more for his own undying fame than for our peace? About the Queen the gossip will die out. As to <a href=/people/4530 target=_blank>Flamma</a>, pray do what you can. </p>                        </div>

XV, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM, 18 MAY: I wrote to you yesterday as I was leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>, and I then paid a visit to my villa at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>. There I saw <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> looking quite well. Nay, more, I saw her afterwards in the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=place long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumae</a>: for she had come to a funeral which I also attended. Our friend Gnaeus <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a> was burying his mother. I stayed therefore that day in the lodge at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411139USin class=place long=13.9122 lat=41.1226>Sinuessa</a>, and when on the point of starting early the next day for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> I dash off this letter. However, I have nothing new to tell you or to ask you; unless by chance you think the following is to the point. Our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has sent me his speech delivered at the public meeting on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a>, and has asked me to correct it before publication without any regard to his feelings. It is, I may add, a speech of the utmost finish as far as the sentiments are concerned, and in point of language not to be surpassed. Nevertheless, if I had had to handle that cause, I should have written with more fire. But the theme and the character of the writer being as you see, I was unable to correct it. For, granting the kind of orator that our <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> aims at being, and the opinion he entertains of the best style of speech, he has secured an unqualified success. Nothing could be more finished. But I have always aimed, rightly or wrongly, at something different. However, read the speech yourself, unless indeed you have read it already, and tell me what you think of it. However, I fear that, misled by your surname, you will be somewhat hyper-Attic in your criticism. But if you will only recall <a href=/people/20 target=_blank>Demosthenes</a>'s thunder, you will understand that the most vigorous denunciation is consistent with the purest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=demonym long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attic</a> style. But of this when we meet. For the present my only wish is that <a href=/people/435 target=_blank>Metrodorus</a> should not go to you without a letter, nor with one that had nothing in it. </p>                        </div>

XV, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) VESCIA, 18 MAY: After despatching a letter to you on the 18th of May as I was starting from the lodge at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411139USin class=place long=13.9122 lat=41.1226>Sinuessa</a>, I stopped at the villa at Vescia. There a letter-carrier delivered me a letter from you in which you say more than enough about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>; for that business is not a source of more anxiety to you than to me. It is but right that you should care for my business, I for yours. Wherefore I have taken up that matter with the determination to regard it as of the first importance. I know from your letter and others that Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> had delivered a miserably poor speech, but I don't know its purport: for you say nothing in your letter. About <a href=/people/707 target=_blank>Menedemus</a> — that's a good thing! Yes, Quintus certainly habitually says what you mention in your letter. I am relieved to find that you approve of my resolution of not writing the sort of thing which you once demanded of me, and you will approve all the more when you read the speech of which I have written to you today. What you say of the legions is true. But you do not appear to me to have sufficiently convinced yourself of it, when you retain a hope that the business of our friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> can be settled by the senate. In my opinion — for I can see as far as that — I don't think we are likely to prevail. But supposing me to be mistaken in that view, you will not be disappointed about <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>. As to <a href=/people/8 target=_blank>Octavius</a>'s speech my opinion agrees with yours: and I don't like his grand set-out for the games, nor <a href=/people/2007 target=_blank>Matius</a> and <a href=/people/419 target=_blank>Postumius</a> acting as his agents for them. <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a> is a worthy colleague. But all those fellows, as you perceive, are as much afraid of peace as we are of war. I should like to be the means of relieving <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> of the popular prejudice against him, but he does not even himself feel any confidence of that being possible. So he is thinking of other measures. I am rejoiced that you find the first book of my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> Disputations arm you against the fear of death: there is, in fact, no other refuge either better or more available. I am not sorry that <a href=/people/4530 target=_blank>Flamma</a> uses language that is satisfactory. What the case of the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381150PTyn class=place long=15.0441 lat=38.1438>Tyndaris</a> is, about which he is anxious, I do not know: yet they are men whom I shall be glad to assist. The circumstances you mention appear to agitate our last of five, especially the withdrawal of public money. I am sorry about <a href=/people/7213 target=_blank>Alexio</a>: but since he had fallen into so painful a disease, I think he must be esteemed fortunate. Yet I should like to know whom he appointed heirs in the second reversion and the day for acceptance named in the will. </p>                        </div>

One was dated the 18th, the other the 21st. First, then, to the earlier of the two. Yes, do make an excursion to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, as you say, where I think I shall arrive on the 27th. You say we must yield to the victors. Not I indeed. There are many things I prefer to that. For as to the proceedings in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SApo class=place long=12.4797 lat=41.8925>temple</a> of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> in the consulship of <a href=/people/204 target=_blank>Lentulus</a> and <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> which you recall-neither the merits of the case nor the circumstances are the same, especially as you say that <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and others are leaving town. So when we meet we must scent out the truth and make up our minds whether it is possible for us to stay at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with safety. The inhabitants of the new community cause me anxiety. For I am in a very embarrassing position. But all that is of small importance: I am treating more serious things than that with disdain. I know all about Calva's will, a mean shabby fellow! Thank you for attending to the auction of <a href=/people/5607 target=_blank>Demonicus</a>. About (<a href=/people/215 target=_blank>Manlius</a>) I wrote some time ago to <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> with the most minute care, if only my letter reached him. I am very anxious for his success and I am in duty bound to be so. Now for the later of your two letters. I know all I want to know about <a href=/people/7213 target=_blank>Alexio</a>. <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> is altogether devoted to you. I wish things were going worse with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> than they are. About the younger Quintus, as you say, assez! About his father I will discuss when we meet. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> I wish to assist in every way within my power. About his little speech — I see you think the same as I do. But I don't understand why you would have me compose one as though delivered by <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, when he has already published his own. How would that do, pray? Should my theme be — a tyrant most righteously put to death? I shall have to say much, and write much, but in a different manner, and at another time. About <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s chair, well done the tribunes! Well done, too, the fourteen rows of knights! I am very glad <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has been staying at my house: I only hope he was comfortable and stayed a good long time. </p>                        </div>

XV, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM, 24 MAY: ON the 24th of May about four o'clock in the afternoon a letter-carrier arrived from Q. <a href=/people/2163 target=_blank>Fufius</a>. He brought me some sort of a note from him expressing a wish that I would restore my favour to him. It was very awkwardly expressed, as is his way: unless perchance the truth is that everything one doesn't like has the appearance of being awkwardly done. My answer was one which I think you will approve. I will reply to your later and fuller letter first. Good! Why, if even Carfulenus does so — le deluge! <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s policy — as you describe it — is revolutionary, and I hope he will carry it out by popular vote rather than by decree of the senate! I think he will do so. But to my mind his whole policy seems to point to war, since the province is being wrested from <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>. Whatever my estimate of the latter's resources, I do not think that this can be done without war. But I don't desire it, for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> are being sufficiently secured as it is! Do you laugh? In good truth I am vexed that they do not rather owe it to my persistence, activity, and influence. You say you don't know what our men are to do. Well, that difficulty has been troubling me all along. Accordingly, I was a fool, I now see, to be consoled by the Ides of March. The fact is, we showed the courage of men, the prudence of children. The tree was felled, but not cut up by the roots. Accordingly, you see how it is sprouting up. Let us go back, then, to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> Arguments — since you often quote them. Let us keep <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a> in the dark about you. I will never blab. You send me a message from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> asking on what day I am to arrive at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. On the 27th of May, as I wrote you word before. And then, in fact, I should like very much to see you as soon as possible. For I think I shall have to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a>, and shan't get off without a great deal of talk. But I will see to it. I now come back to your earlier letter. I will pass over the first clause about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a>, for That in my heart of hearts is fixed. I only hope, as you say, we may have some opportunity of acting in the matter. You must be very keen about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s speech, considering the length at which you discuss it again. Would you have me treat the subject after he has actually produced a written oration on it? Am I to write without being asked by him? That would be putting one's oar in with a vengeance I Nothing could be ruder. But some thing, say you, in the style of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a>. Well, I don't decline that much: but it is necessary first to settle on a line of argument, and secondly to wait for a more suitable time for writing. For think what you will of me (though of course I should like you to think as well as possible), if things go on as they seem to be doing — you will not be vexed at my saying it — I feel no pleasure in the Ides of March. For <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would never have come back: fear would not have forced us to confirm his acts. Or supposing me to join <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a>'s school and abandon the doctrines of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=ethnic long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculans</a>, I was so high in his favour (whom may the gods confound though dead!) that to a man of my age he was not a master to be shunned, since the slaying of the master has not made us free men. I blush-believe me. But I have written the words, and will not erase them. I only wish it had been true about <a href=/people/707 target=_blank>Menedemus</a>. About the Queen I hope it may turn out to be true. The rest when we meet, and especially as to what our heroes are to do, and even what I am to do myself if <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> means to blockade the senate with soldiers. If I had given this letter to his letter-carrier I feared he would open it. So I send it with special care: for I was obliged to answer yours. </p>                        </div>

They are very earnest to have my advice-<a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, indeed, wants to know which of the two courses I recommend. What a miserable state of things! I am quite uncertain what to say to them. So I think I shall try silence, unless you think I had better not. But if anything occurs to you, pray write and tell me. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, however, begs and entreats me earnestly to bring <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> over to the right side as much as possible. Do you think he is in his right senses?  Ashes and dust Is all our trust. I inclose his letter. <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> also writes to the same effect as you do as to the province of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> to be assigned by decree of the senate. And <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>, too, says that he shall absent himself. For he is now in his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa, and is earnestly advising me to keep away. He does so because of the danger which he asserts to have threatened even him: I, however — even supposing there to be no danger — am so far from caring to avoid <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s suspicion and his thinking me displeased at his success, that the very cause of my unwillingness to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> is to avoid seeing him. Our friend <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, however, has sent me a letter — I don't know from whom, for he had erased the name — in which it was asserted that the veterans whose claims are postponed — for a certain number had been disbanded — are using most mutinous language, declaring that those who are thought to be against their party will find themselves in great danger at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. What then will be our coming and going, our look and our gait, among such fellows? Nay, if Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> — as you tell me — is attacking <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, and the rest our heroes, what am I to do? How am I to bear myself? In short, I have made up my mind — at any rate, if things don't alter — to absent myself from a city in which I once not only flourished in the highest position, but even when a subject enjoyed one of some sort. However, I have not so much resolved to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> — about which I will consult you — as not to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. </p>                        </div>

XV, 6) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM, 25 JUNE: OUR friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> has, as well as <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, written to me to urge that I should bring over <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> to the right side as much as possible. I neither knew that he entertained loyal sentiments, nor did I feel any confidence in being able to improve him in that respect by my influence: for though he is perhaps somewhat irritated with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, he is devotedly attached to the cause. Nevertheless, I wrote to him and commended to him the maintenance of the civil position of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. I wished you to know the nature of his answer, in case you might entertain the same opinion as myself, namely, that that party are even now afraid of those heroes of ours having perhaps more courage than they actually do retain.  <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a> to his friend <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>. You want to know whether I have yet returned from the country. Am I to be showing indifference, when all the world is in a state of excitement? I in fact have left town because it is my belief that my absence is more advantageous than my presence. I despatch this letter to you when on the point of starting for my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa. Don't imagine me to be so indefatigable as to hurry back by the 5th. I can't see that there is anything now requiring my attention, especially as provision for safety has been made for so many years in advance. How I wish that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> may be induced by your entreaties not to enter upon any hot-headed design, as easily as they can obtain a like promise from you in regard to myself! For you say that they have written what you mention when on the point of leaving the country. Why or whither are they going? Stop them, I beseech you, <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a>: and don't allow the present settlement to be entirely undone, which, on my honour, is being shaken by plunder, arson, and murder. Let them only take precautions against absolute danger: don't let them attempt anything beyond. I assure you they will gain nothing more by the most spirited policy than by resolutely playing the waiting game, so long as they remain on the alert. For things here are in a state of transition, and cannot from their very nature last long as they are. If a struggle occurs they have means to strike an ugly blow. What your hopes are for them write and tell me at my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa. There is <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>'s letter. I said in answer that they were not contemplating anything more stirring than usual; and I assured him of it. I wanted you to know this, for what it was worth. Just as I had sealed this letter <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> writes to say that <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> has returned to town, and assures him that they do not intend to leave the country.

Also one from <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>, who says that the veterans are much incensed with him. I am still uncertain what to do about the 1st. I am therefore sending Tiro, and with Tiro a number of men, to each one of whom pray give a letter as each event occurs. I have written also to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> about a legation, for fear that, if I only wrote to <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, that quick-tempered man might be stirred up to wrath. As, however, he is said to be somewhat difficult of approach, I have written to <a href=/people/7685 target=_blank>Eutrapelus</a>, asking him to forward my letter to him, saying that I want a legatio. A votive legation would be the more honour-able of the two, but I could manage with either one or the other. I beg you again and again to consider your own position. If possible I should like to talk it over with you; if you cannot meet me, we shall attain the same object by letter. <a href=/people/6508 target=_blank>Graeceius</a> writes me word that C. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> has written to tell him that men are being got ready to send armed to my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> villa.

What an indignity! To begin with, to take any appointment from that party, and then, if they must take some office, such a subordinate one as that, which could be done by legati! And yet I don't feel sure that it isn't better than sitting idle on the banks of his <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224WEur class=place long=22.427 lat=37.093>Eurotas</a>. But these things will be governed by fortune. He says also that a decree is going to be passed at the same meeting for assigning provinces to them and other ex-praetors.

Are you laughing, you ask, in such grave matters? What am I to do? I am tired of lamenting. Good heavens, what a fright the first page of your letter gave me! Why, how did that warlike outbreak in your house come about? But I rejoice that that storm-cloud at any rate has passed quickly away. I am very anxious to hear how you sped on that conciliatory mission — it was a melancholy as well as a difficult one. For the knot cannot be untied: we are so completely hemmed in by every kind of force. For myself, the letter of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, which you show me that you have read, has caused me so much agitation that, though I was already at a loss which course to adopt, I am yet rendered still less ready to act from distress of mind. But I will write more fully when I have your news. For the present I have nothing to say, and the less so that I am doubtful of your getting even this letter. For it is uncertain whether the letter-carrier will find you. I am very anxious for a letter from you. </p>                        </div>

Yet, what am I to say? That they should accept the favour of that party? What could be more degrading? That they should attempt some move? They neither have the courage nor — as things are now — the power. Well, suppose they take my advice and do nothing. Who can guarantee their safety? For if any severe measure is taken as to <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a>, what kind of life will our heroes lead, even supposing no one actually attacks them? Again, not to preside at his own games, what could be a greater indignity? To give them the duty of purchasing corn-isn't that a case of <a href=/people/104 target=_blank>Dion</a>'s embassy? Is there a more menial office in the public service? Even advice in such a matter is absolutely dangerous to those who give it. However, I might neglect that consideration if I were only doing some good. But why put my foot in, if it is all for nothing?

XV, 10) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ANTIUM, 8 JUNE: I reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> on the 8th. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> was delighted at my arrival. Thereupon in the presence of a large party-<a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a>, dear Tertia, and <a href=/people/2013 target=_blank>Porcia</a> — he asked me my opinion. <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> was there too. I had thought over what to say as I was on the road, and now advised him to avail himself of the corn-purchasing office in Asia. I urged that all we could now do was to consult for his safety: that on him depended the defence of the constitution itself. I had just got well into my speech when <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> came in. I repeated the same remarks. At this point <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> with a determined look in his eyes — you would have said he was breathing war — declared that he would not go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. Was he to accept as a favour what was meant as an insult? What are you going to do then? said I. He replied that he would go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=place long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaia</a>. And you, <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>? said I. To <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, if you think it right, said he. I don't think so at all, said I, for you will not be safe. But if I could be there safely, would you think I ought to go? Yes, said I, and that you should not go to a province either now or after your praetorship. But I do not advise your trusting yourself to the city. Then I stated the reasons, which will doubtless occur to you, why he was not likely to be safe there. Then followed a long conversation in which they complained — and especially <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> — that opportunities had been let slip. They were especially hard upon <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a>. I said that they should not harp on the past, but I agreed with them all the same. When, however, I had begun discussing what ought to have been done — my topics were the old ones and such as are in everybody's mouth-without touching upon the question as to whether some one else ought to have been attacked, I said that the senate should have been summoned, the people already burning with excitement should have been still farther roused, that the whole government of the state should have been taken in hand by them. At that point your friend <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> exclaims: That indeed I never heard anyone —  Here I stopped her. But I not only think that <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> will go, for <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> promised to see that this corn-commissionership should be cut out of the senatorial decree, but <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> also was quickly induced to give up that foolish talk of being determined to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. He accordingly settled that the games should be given in his name without his presence. He, however, appeared to me to wish to start for Asia from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a>. In short, I got no satisfaction from my journey except the consciousness of having done my duty. For it was impossible for me to allow him to quit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> without my having had an interview with him. Barring the discharge of this obligation of duty and affection, I could only ask myself: What doth thy journey here avail thee, seer? In good truth I found a ship with timbers all started, or rather gone to pieces. No plan, no system, no method! Accordingly, though I had no doubt before, I am now more bent than ever to fly away — and that at the first chance —  Where deeds and fame of the <a href=/people/2179 target=_blank>Pelopidae</a> May greet my ears no more. But look here! Not to keep you in the dark, <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> named me his legatus on the 2nd of June. That announcement reached me yesterday evening. Even you did not approve of my having a votive legation. And indeed it would have been absurd for me to be discharging the vows made in case of the constitution being maintained, after that constitution had been overthrown. Besides free legations have, I think, a fixed limit of time by the <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a> law, and an addition is difficult to secure. The sort of legation I want is one that admits of my coming back or going out as I choose: and that is now secured to me. Very pleasant too is the privilege of exercising this right for five years. Yet why think about five years? If I am not deceived the end is not far off. But absit omen. </p>                        </div>

But I had sent Tiro, as you bade me, to <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> with a letter. What harm can it do? About our friends at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/415126UAnt class=place long=12.6286 lat=41.4552>Antium</a> I think my last letter was sufficiently full and explicit. It must have convinced you that they intended to take no active step, but to avail themselves of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s insulting favour. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> would have nothing to do with the corn business. <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> said that she would get it cut out of the senatorial decree. Our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, however, assumes very tragic airs and says-after agreeing with me that he cannot be safe at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — that he will start for Asia as soon as he has handed over the equipment for the games to those who are to hold them, for he prefers to give them, though he won't be present at them. He is collecting vessels. He is full of his voyage. Meanwhile they intend to stay where they are. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> indeed says that he will visit <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414128UAst class=place long=12.7653 lat=41.4089>Astura</a>. Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> on his part writes to me in a courteous tone bidding me have no anxiety. I owe him one favour, perhaps I shall owe him another if he comes to my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> house. What unendurable worries! Yet we do endure them after all. Which of the <a href=/people/4100 target=_blank>Bruti</a> (oh rightly named!) is to blame for this? In <a href=/people/2641 target=_blank>Octavianus</a>, as I have perceived, there is no little ability and spirit; and he seems likely to be as well disposed to our heroes as I could wish. But what confidence one can feel in a man of his age, name, inheritance, and upbringing may well give us pause. His stepfather, whom I have seen at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/414128UAst class=place long=12.7653 lat=41.4089>Astura</a>, thinks none at all. However, we must foster him and — if nothing else-keep him apart from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> will be doing admirable service if he gives him good advice. <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a> seemed to me to be devoted to him: but he has no great confidence in <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> and <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>.

L. <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> asks for it, pay him back every farthing. In a previous letter I mentioned to you a sum of 110 sestertia to be paid to <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>. If, then, <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> applies for the money, I wish it paid to him, and to no one except <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a>. I think that amount was put into my hands, and I have written to <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> to produce it. I can't stand the Queen: and the voucher for her promises, <a href=/people/5686 target=_blank>Hammonius</a>, knows that I have good cause for saying so. What she promised, indeed, were all things of the learned sort and suitable to my character-such as I could avow even in a public meeting. As for Sara, besides finding him to be an unprincipled rascal, I also found him inclined to give himself airs to me. I only saw him once at my house. And when I asked him politely what I could do for him, he said that he had come in hopes of finding <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>. The Queen's insolence, too, when she was living in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s trans-Tiberine villa, I cannot recall without a pang. I won't have anything to do therefore with that lot. They think not so much that I have no spirit, as that I have scarcely any proper pride at all. My leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> is hindered by <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>'s way of doing business. For whereas from the balances struck by him on the 5th of April I ought to be well off; I am obliged to borrow, while the receipts from those paying properties of mine I think have been put aside for building the shrine. But I have charged Tiro to see to all this, whom I am sending to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> for the express purpose. I did not wish to add to your existing embarrassments. The steadier the conduct of my son, the more I am vexed at his being hampered. For he never mentioned the subject to me — the first person to whom he should have done so. But he said in a letter to Tiro that he had received nothing since the 1st of April — for that was the end of his financial year. Now I know that your own kind feeling always caused you to be of opinion that he ought to be treated not only with liberality, but with splendour and generosity, and that you also considered that to be due to my position. Wherefore pray see — I would not have troubled you if I could have done it through anyone else — that he has a bill of exchange at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> for his year's allowance. <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> will pay you the money. I am sending Tiro on that business. Pray therefore see to it, and write and tell me any idea you may have on the subject. </p>                        </div>

Yes, tell me about <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> when you know. I am informed about the pretended terror of the consuls. For <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> had-with loyal warmth indeed, but somewhat confusedly-already informed me of that suspicion also. Well, what is your opinion? Is it, Never refuse a good offer ? For I haven't a word from Siregius. I don't like it. I am very much annoyed that anyone was informed about your neighbour <a href=/people/6828 target=_blank>Plaetorius</a> before myself. As to <a href=/people/2132 target=_blank>Syrus</a>, you acted with wisdom. You will, I think, have no difficulty in keeping Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> off by means of his brother. I told you not to pay <a href=/people/5439 target=_blank>Antro</a>, but you had not received my letter telling you not to pay anyone but L. <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a>.

As to the Queen I am glad you don't feel anxious, and that you accept the evidence.

I ask, because you remark that all your trouble has been thrown away. Why again is <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> returning? I am grieved, on my honour, that you have been so distracted. You have to thank those ten land-commissioner fellows for that. Yes, that was a tough piece of business, but it had to be borne, and I am exceedingly obliged to you. As to taking up arms — I never saw anything more patent. So let me be off; as you say. I don't know what <a href=/people/1680 target=_blank>Theophanes</a> wants with an interview: he has already written to me, and I answered him as best I could. However, he writes to say that he wants to call on me, to discuss some business of his own and certain matters affecting myself. I am anxious for a letter from you. Pray take care that nothing rash is done. <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a> has written to tell me that Quintus <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> has spoken to him in very strong terms, saying that he cannot put up with the present state of affairs: that he is resolved to go over to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. Of course I am now anxious to learn all about this: I am quite unable to explain its meaning. It may be that he is angry with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> about something; it may be that he now wants some new chance of distinguishing himself; it may be a mere passing fancy. And, indeed, it is doubtless that. All the same I am nervous about it and his father is quite upset. For he knows what he used to say about <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>: in fact he said to me what won't bear repetition. I cannot conceive what he has got in his head. I shall only have such commissions from <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> as I choose — that is, none at all. Tell me about Gaius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> — did he wish to be on the land-commission? He was at any rate worthy of such a company.

Let <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> give me any commissions he chooses, even to take a message to <a href=/people/12472 target=_blank>Nicias</a>. For who, as you say, will care to ask questions? Or does anyone with any sense in his head doubt that my departure is an act of despair, and not really a legation? You say that men are using certain extremist expressions about public affairs, and that too men of sound loyalty. Well, ever since I heard of his speaking of the tyrant in a public meeting as that most illustrious man, I began to have qualms of doubt: but when along with you I saw our heroes at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417127ULan class=place long=12.6989 lat=41.6777>Lanuvium</a> with no hope of life but what they received from <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, I gave it up for lost. And so, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, I would have you receive what I am going to say with the same courage as that with which I write it. Regarding the kind of death experienced by <a href=/people/481 target=_blank>Catulus</a> as shocking, and yet as in a manner already pronounced against us by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, I have resolved to escape from this net, not with a view to flight, but with a hope of a better sort of death. For this <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> is entirely to blame. You say that <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> has been received at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362000UCar class=place long=-5.4104 lat=36.1832>Carteia</a>, so we shall presently see an army sent against him. Which camp am I to join then? For <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> makes neutrality impossible. The one is weak, the other criminal. Let us make haste therefore. But help me to make up my mind- <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a> or <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>? <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> for his part is starting somewhat suddenly, but wisely. I feel it a good deal, for when shall I see him again. But such is life. Even you cannot see him. Heaven confound that dead man for ever meddling with <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>! But let us leave the past. Let us look to what there is to do. The accounts of <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a>, though I have not yet seen him personally, I yet know pretty thoroughly from his own letter and Tiro's report. You say that I must raise a fresh loan for five months, that is, till the 1st of November, of 200 sestertia: that on that day a certain sum of money falls in owed by Quintus. As Tiro tells me that you would not have me come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on that business, please see, if it does not bore you too much, where to raise the money and put it down to my account. That is what I see for the present to be necessary. As to other details I will demand a stricter account from <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> himself-among other things as to the rents of the dower properties. If these are faithfully collected for the benefit of my son, though I wish him more liberally provided, yet he will have pretty well as much as he needs. And indeed I see that I shall want some journey-money also. But my son will be paid from these properties as the money comes in. I, on the contrary, need a lump sum. The fact is that though that trembler at shadows appears to me to have his eye on massacre, I am nevertheless not going to budge unless the payment of the money is arranged. But whether it has been arranged or not I shall learn when I see you. I thought this ought to be written by my own hand, and I have accordingly so written it. Yes, you are right about <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> — not in any case to anyone else. Please answer this today. </p>                        </div>

For his son has written to say that he desired to desert to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, because, when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> charged him to secure his being made dictator, and to seize some fort, he refused. He says also that he refused for fear of hurting his father's feelings: and that ever since <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had been his enemy. Thereupon, says he, I pulled myself together for fear he should do you some injury. So I smoothed him down: and indeed got 400 sestertia from him in cash, and a promise of more. <a href=/people/594 target=_blank>Statius</a>, moreover, writes word that the young man desires to share his father's house. This is a wonderful story, and my brother is in raptures with it. Did you ever know a greater fraud? You were both quite right to hesitate as to the affair of <a href=/people/3357 target=_blank>Canus</a>. I had had no suspicion about the deeds — I thought her dowry had been repayed in full. I shall look forward to hearing what you postpone mentioning in order to discuss it when we meet. Keep my letter-carriers as long as you like: for I know you are busy. As to <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> — quite right! I will send you what I am writing when I have finished it. You told Quintus that you had sent him a letter: no one had brought one. Tiro says that you don't now approve of my going by <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, and indeed that you say some-thing about soldiers there.

But to start from this side — what a weary voyage! But I shall see. I have had no letter from you on the 21st. Naturally; for what is there new to say any longer? Therefore come as soon as you can.

I believe <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> is using satisfactory language. For I know that he has always been closely united with <a href=/people/612 target=_blank>Hirtius</a>.

But when will he ever see them? And that he will be opposed to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> — but when and on what grounds? How long are we to be fooled? However, I wrote you word that Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> was coming, not because he was actually near, but because he was certainly contemplating that move and because he was not showing any signs of abandoning arms.

XV, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) TUSCULUM, 26 JUNE: ON the 26th I received a letter from <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, a copy of which I inclose. He says in it that he has acted in all ways to your satisfaction. I wrote back at once thanking him at some length. However, to prevent his wondering why I should do the same a second time, I explained that the reason was that I had not been able previously to get any information from you when we were together. However, to cut the matter short, my answer was as follows: Cicero to his friend <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, consul. Having on a previous occasion been informed by a letter from our friend <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> of the great liberality and the very great kindness which you had shown him; and you having yourself written to tell me of your having done everything that we wished, I wrote to thank you in language meant to show that you could have done me no greater favour. But when <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> himself came to see me with the express purpose of declaring his gratitude to you, whose really eminent and surprising kindness in the business of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> and marked affection for himself he had thoroughly appreciated, I could not be restrained from giving a more open expression to the same feeling on my part in this letter. Let me assure you, my dear <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>, that of all your kindnesses and services to me — eminent as they are — the most generous and gratifying in my eyes is this, that you have made <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> understand how much I love you and you me. For the rest, though the claims and political existence of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> have been set on a firm foundation by you, I would wish you — for I always want to make my favours secure — to resolve that, having been taken under your care and frequently recommended by me, they shall continue to enjoy the support of your influence and active assistance. That will be sufficient protection to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> for ever, and you will have set both <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> and myself free from great care and anxiety if you undertake in compliment to me to resolve that they shall always enjoy your defence. I warmly and repeatedly entreat you to do so. After writing this letter I devoted myself to my treatise, which, however, I fear will require to be scored by your red wax in a good number of places. I have been so distracted and hindered by engrossing thoughts. </p>                        </div>

XV, 26) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM, 2 JULY: I see that you have done all you can about Quintus's business. For his part, he is hesitating whether to oblige Lepta or to damage his son's credit. I have heard it whispered that Lucius <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> wants to go abroad as a legate in virtue of a forged decree of the senate. I should like to know the truth. That letter-carrier, whom I told you that I sent to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, returned to me at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417132UAna class=place long=13.1589 lat=41.7422>Anagnia</a> on the night of the 30th of June, and brought me a letter, which contained that same request — as unlike as could possibly be conceived to his usually conspicuous good sense — that I should be present at his games. I wrote back of course to say, first, that I have already started on my journey, so that it is no longer in my power to do so: and secondly, that it would be the strangest paradox that, while I have not set foot in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> since this arming began — and that, not so much from consideration of my personal danger as of my self-respect — I should suddenly come to the games. For to be giving games at such a crisis is honourable enough for him, because he can't help it; but for me to attend them, as it is not necessary, so neither is it honourable. Of course I eagerly desire them to be largely attended and as popular as possible, and I feel sure they will be so; and I bargain with you to send me an account of how they are received from the very first hour they begin, and thenceforth all that happens day by day to their close. But enough of the games. The remainder of his letter may indeed be regarded in two different lights, yet, nevertheless, he does at times emit some sparks of manly courage. I want you to be able to express what you think of it, and therefore inclose a copy of the letter: though our letter-carrier told me that he had brought a letter from you also from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, and that it had been forwarded to you from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. I have arranged my journeys so as to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> on the 7th of July. For though I am in a great hurry, I mean to take every precaution humanly possible as to my voyage. Please free Marcus <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> from his anxiety: tell him that my idea was that a few feet along the edge of the land — and that under the surface-would have some sort of easement upon them: and that I absolutely objected to it, and did 'not think that anything could make up for it. But, as you suggest, put it as gently as possible, rather by way of relieving him of anxiety than giving him any suspicion of my being annoyed. So also about <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>'s debt, speak to <a href=/people/7442 target=_blank>Cascellius</a> in a liberal spirit. It's a small matter, but I am obliged to you for attending to it. It was a bit of rather sharp practice. And if he had taken me in at all, as he nearly did — only that you were too many for him — I should have been seriously annoyed. So, whatever is to be the result, I would prefer the transaction being stayed. Remember that an eighth share of the aedes Tullianae near the temple of Strenia, is due to <a href=/people/3354 target=_blank>Caerellia</a>: see that it is conveyed to her at the highest price bid at the auction. I think that was 380 sestertia. If there is any news, even if you foresee anything that you think likely to happen, pray write and tell me as often as possible. As I have already Charged you to do, pray remember to apologize to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> for the late arrival of my letter. What terms your friend <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> has made with Marcus <a href=/people/337 target=_blank>Ennius</a> about the will I should like you to tell me — for I always like to know things. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>, 2nd July. </p>                        </div>

MUNATIUS PLANCUS (AT ROME) (ARPINUM BEFORE 6TH OF JULY) MARCUS <a href=/people/2300 target=_blank>Cicero</a> greets Lucius <a href=/people/3050 target=_blank>Munatius</a> <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, praetor-designate. I know you are fond of our friend <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, while for my society you show so much taste that upon my word I think I have few friends so attentive and affectionate. For to our ancestral ties — so close, old, and legitimate — a great additional force has been added by your personal kind feeling towards me and an equal and mutual one on my part towards you. Now you are acquainted with the case of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a>, for I have often pleaded it and clearly set it forth in your hearing. Its history is as follows. As soon as we observed that the territory of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a> was declared confiscate, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> in great alarm drew up a petition. He put that in my hands to present to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>: for I happened to be going to dine with him on that day. I presented that petition to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. He approved of the plea and wrote in answer to <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> saying that his demand was fair. He, however, warned him that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> must pay their arrears to the day. <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> in his eager desire for the preservation of the state paid the money out of his own pocket. That being done I approached <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>, stated the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=demonym long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotian</a> case, and obtained a decree of the most generous nature, which was countersigned by men of the highest rank. In these circumstances I own that I used to be surprised at <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> allowing a number of men who had cast greedy eyes on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=demonym long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotian</a> territory to hold meetings; and that he not only allowed that, but even put you at the head of the land-commission. Accordingly, on my remonstrating with him, and indeed so often that I incurred a rebuke from him for not trusting his fidelity to his word, he told both Marcus <a href=/people/747 target=_blank>Messalla</a> and <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> himself not to be alarmed, and made no concealment of the fact that he did not wish — for he was fond of popularity, as you know — to hurt the feelings of those who were in possession; but since they had already crossed the sea, he would see to their being removed to some other land. This is what happened while he was alive. Well, after <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s death, as soon as the consuls in accordance with a decree of the senate began hearing cases, what I have just told you was laid before them. They admitted the plea without any hesitation and said that they would send you a despatch. However, my dear <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a>, though I did not doubt that a senatorial decree, a law, and the decision and despatch of the consuls would have the greatest weight with you, and although I quite understood that you wished to please <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> himself, yet in view of our friendship and mutual goodwill I have ventured to beg of you, what your own unique kindness and exquisite goodness of heart would be sure to obtain from you. It is that, what I feel sure you will do of your own accord, you should out of compliment to me do with heartiness, completeness, and speed. No one is a warmer, more charming, or dearer friend than <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> is to me. Formerly it was only his money, and that a very large sum, that was at stake: now it concerns his credit also, that he should by your assistance maintain what he had secured by the exertion of great industry and influence both in <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s lifetime and after it. If I obtain this favour from you, I should wish you to consider that I shall construe your liberality as a personal benefit of the highest kind to myself. I will attend with zeal and diligence to whatever I may think is your wish or to your interest. Take care of your health. </p>                        </div>

XV, 29) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) FORMIAE, 6 JULY: I send you <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s letter. Good heavens, what helplessness! You will understand when you have read it. About the celebration of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>'s games I agree with you. No, don't go to see M. <a href=/people/499 target=_blank>Aelius</a> at his house, but speak to him wherever you may chance to meet him. About the moiety of <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a>'s debt consult Marcus Axianus, as you suggest. Your arrangement with Cosianus — first rate! For your disentanglement of my own affairs and yours at the same time — thanks! I am glad my legation is approved. Heaven send that your promises are fulfilled! For what could be more gratifying to me and mine? But I feel misgiving about her, of whom you make an exception. When I have met <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, I will send you a full account. About <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> and <a href=/people/412 target=_blank>Decimus</a>, I wish it may be so! I wouldn't have Sextus throw away his shield. About <a href=/people/12180 target=_blank>Mundus</a> tell me anything you learn. So I have answered all your news. Now for my own. The younger Quintus is going to escort me as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> — what an admirable loyalist! you might call him a <a href=/people/1184 target=_blank>Favonius</a> — <a href=/people/685 target=_blank>Asinius</a>. He has two motives for doing so: my society, and a wish to make terms with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>. But what say you? For I know you are intimate with the Othones. Quintus says that <a href=/people/7020 target=_blank>Tutia</a> offers herself to him, as a divorce has been arranged. His father asked me what sort of reputation she had. I said — for I didn't know why he asked the question — that I had never heard anything except about her looks and her father. But why do you ask? said I. Then he said that his son wanted her. Thereupon, though I felt disgusted, I said that I didn't believe those stories. His aim — for that is the truth — is to make our friend no allowance. But the lady says she won't be baulked by the like of him. However, I suspect young Quintus is, as usual, romancing. But please make inquiries — for you can easily do so — and let me know. Pray what's this all about? When I had already sealed this letter some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413136UFor class=ethnic long=13.6012 lat=41.2557>Formians</a> who were dining with me told me that the day before I write this — that is, on the 5th — they had seen our <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=demonym long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotian</a> commissioner <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> With downcast look and bare of ornament; and that his poor slaves said that he and the land-grabbers had been turned out of the Country by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a>.

XVI, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 8 JULY: I arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> on the 7th. I write this on the following day as I am crossing to <a href=/people/4624 target=_blank>Nesis</a>. But on the day of my arrival, as I was at dinner <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> brought me your letter. Is it really so? Nones of July! The gods confound them! But one might rage all day long. What could be a greater insult to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> than July? I come back to my oldquousque tandem? I have never seen anything worse. But what is this, pray, about the land-grabbers being cut to pieces at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>? How also came <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> to be on the run day and night — for that is whispered to me? I am very anxious to know what it means. I am glad that my going abroad is commended: I must try and get my staying at home praised also. That the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381216PDym class=ethnic long=21.5514 lat=38.1446>Dymaeans</a> should harry the sea after being expelled from their lands is no wonder. There seems to be some protection in making the voyage in company with <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. But I think his vessels are small. However, I shall know all about it directly, and will write to you tomorrow. As to <a href=/people/766 target=_blank>Ventidius</a>, I think it is a canard. As to Sextus, it is regarded as certain that he is giving in. If this is true, we must submit to being slaves even without a civil war. What are we to say then? Is our hope in <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a> and the 1st of January? That's all moonshine, considering the drunken and drowsy habits of these men. About the 230 sestertia-capital! Let my son's accounts be put straight. For Ovius has just arrived and his report is much to my satisfaction: among other things it is by no means bad that seventy-two sestertia is enough, and quite liberal, but that <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> furnishes him very sparingly and stingily. You say that your bill of exchange amounted to more than the rent of the town lots. Well, let the year in which he had the additional expense of the journey be credited with the balance. From the 1st of April next let his allowance be kept to the eighty sestertia. For the town lots now produce that amount. We must see to some settlement for him when he is back in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For I don't think that he could endure that woman as a mother-in-law. About my <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cuman</a> villa I aid no to <a href=/people/2119 target=_blank>Pindarus</a>. Now let me inform you of my motive for sending you a letter-carrier. Young Quintus promises me that he will be a regular <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>. But both father and son urged me to guarantee this to you, though with the understanding that you shouldn't believe it till you had practical proof of it yourself. I will give him a letter such as he desires. Don't let it influence your opinion. I am writing this to prevent your supposing that I am convinced. Heaven send that he carries out his promises! It will be a satisfaction to everyone concerned. But I-well, I will say nothing more. He starts on the 10th. He says he is making a consignment of debts for the 15th, but that he is being very hard pressed. You will judge from my letter what answer to give him. I will write at greater length when I have seen <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and am sending <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> back. I quite accept my dear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>'s apology, and love her dearly Give my kind regards to her and <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a>. </p>                        </div>

XVI, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 9 JULY: <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> is anxious for a letter from you. I told him about the <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a> of <a href=/people/1390 target=_blank>Accius</a>, though he had heard it before. He thought that it was the <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. But, after all, some whisper of a report had reached him that at the opening of the Greek games the attendance had been small, at which for one I was not surprised. For you know my opinion of Greek games. But now listen to what is of more importance than everything else. Young Quintus stayed with me several days, and if I had wished it would have been quite willing to stay longer. But as far as his visit went you could hardly believe how much delighted I was with him in every particular, but especially in the point in which he used most to disappoint me. For he has become such an entirely changed man — partly by certain writings of mine on which I am now engaged, and partly by my constantly talking to him and impressing my maxims upon him — that he is really going to be all that I wish in politics. After having not only declared this to me, but also thoroughly convinced me of it, he implored me at great length to guarantee to you that he would in the future be worthy of you and of us. And he didn't ask you to believe this at once, but that you should only restore your affection to him when you had seen it with your own eyes. Had he not convinced me of this, and had I not made up my mind that what I am saying might be relied upon, I would not have done what I am going to tell you. I took the young man with me to see <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. The latter was so convinced of what I am telling you, that he took upon himself to believe in him independently, and would have none of me as guarantee. He praised him and spoke of you in the most friendly tone, and dismissed him with embraces and kisses. Wherefore, though I have more reason to congratulate you than to prefer any request to you, yet I do also request you that if there appeared to be certain irregularities in his conduct heretofore, owing to the weakness of youth, you should believe that he has now rid himself of them, and should trust me when I say that your influence will contribute much, or I should rather say more than anything else, to make his decision permanent. Though I made frequent hints to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> about our sailing together, he didn't seem to catch at the suggestion as eagerly as I had expected. I thought him in an uneasy frame of mind, and indeed he was so-especially about the games. But when I had got back to my villa Gnaeus <a href=/people/1633 target=_blank>Lucceius</a>, who sees a good deal of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, told me that he was hesitating a great deal as to his departure, not from any change of policy, but because he was waiting to see if any-thing turned up. So I am doubting whether I shall direct my steps to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410158UVen class=place long=15.8176 lat=40.9615>Venusia</a> and there wait to hear about the legions: and if they do not come, as some expect — go on to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401185UHyd class=place long=18.491 lat=40.1457>Hydruntum</a>: but if neither port is safe — come back to where I am. Do you think I am joking? Upon my life you are the only tie that keeps me here. For take a careful view of the situation: but do it before I have cause to blush for my conduct. Ah! <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>'s notice of his inauguration days is just like him, and just suits with my plan of return. Your letter conveys a strong motive for my starting for Greece. And oh, that I might find you there! But it must be as you think most to your advantage. I am anxious for a letter from <a href=/people/12142 target=_blank>Nepos</a>. Can he really want my books, when he thinks the subjects on which I plume myself not worth reading? Yes — as you say: in form and face <a href=/people/63 target=_blank>Ajax</a> the flower of all the Grecian host Next to the flawless son whom <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> bore. You are the flawless one — he is one of the immortals. There is no collection of my letters in existence: but Tiro has something like seventy. Moreover, there are some to be got from you. I ought to look through and correct them. They shall not be published till I have done so. </p>                        </div>

XVI, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 10 JULY: So, as I told you yesterday — or perhaps I should say today, for Quintus said he should not reach you till the second day — I went to <a href=/people/4624 target=_blank>Nesis</a> on the 8th. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> was there. How hurt he was by the Nones of July! He was really surprisingly upset. Accordingly, he said that he should write orders to advertise the beast-hunt, which is to follow the games of <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, as to take place on the 3rd day before the Ides of Quinctilis. <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> came in while I was there. He said that <a href=/people/486 target=_blank>Philo</a>, a freedman of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>'s, and <a href=/people/4557 target=_blank>Hilarus</a>, a freedman of his own, had come from Sextus <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> with a letter addressed to the consuls, or whatever they are called. He read us a copy of it, to see if anything occurred to us. There were a few ill-expressed sentences: in other respects it was written with considerable dignity and without violence. The only addition we decided upon was that instead of being addressed to the consuls only, it should be addressed to consuls, praetors, tribunes of the plebs, and senate, for fear the consuls should decline to produce a letter addressed to themselves personally. They also report that Sextus has been at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376-09PCar class=place long=-0.9738 lat=37.6013>New Carthage</a> with only one legion, and that on the very day on which he captured the town of <a href=/people/7362 target=_blank>Barea</a> he received the news about <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>. That after the capture of the town there was great rejoicing and recovery of spirits, and people flocked to him from every side; but that he returned to the six legions which he had left in lower Spain. He also wrote to <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a> saying that be cared for nothing unless he were allowed to return to his own house. The upshot of his demands was that all armies wherever stationed should be disbanded. That is nearly all about Sextus. Though I have been asking questions of everybody about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a>, I cannot find out the truth. Some say the land-grabbers were badly mauled, others that <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> for a sum of money abandoned them and fled. So I don't see how I am to know the truth of the matter unless I get some sort of letter at once. The route to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, about which I was hesitating, appears now to be out of the question: for the legions are said to be arriving there. But the voyage from this place is not without its suspicion of dangers. Therefore I am making up my mind to a joint voyage. I found <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> more advanced in his preparations than I had been told was the case. For both he and <a href=/people/162 target=_blank>Domitius</a> have some really good two-banked galleys; there are also some fine vessels belonging to <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a>, Bucilianus, and others. For, as to the fleet of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, which is a really fine one, I don't count on that beyond the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> Strait. One thing does cause me some little uneasiness — that <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> seems to be in no great hurry. In the first place he is waiting for news as to the completion of his games; in the next place, as far as I can understand, he is likely to make the voyage slowly, stopping at several points. However, I think it is better to sail slowly than not to sail at all. And if; when we have got some distance on, things seem more certain we shall take advantage of the <a href=/people/12230 target=_blank>Etesian</a> winds. </p>                        </div>

XVI, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 11 JULY: ON the 10th I received two letters, one from my own letter-carrier and the other from that of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. The story about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=ethnic long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotians</a> was widely different in these parts, but that is only one of the many inconveniences with which one must put up.. I am sending <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> back sooner than I intended; that there might be some one to pay <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, and those in fact with whom he says that he has fixed the 15th as the day of settlement <a href=/people/348 target=_blank>Hortensius</a>, however, is shameless in his demand; for nothing is due to him except in virtue of the third instalment, payable on the 1st of August — and of this very instalment the greater part has been paid him considerably before the day. But <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> will see to this on the 15th. As for <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a>, however, I think there ought to be no delay in paying him the amount for which a draft is due. But when you come to look at the concessions I have made from my legal rights in having paid in ready money of the balance of 400 sestertia, and in now giving a note for the remainder, you will be able, if you think right, to say to him that he ought to wait my convenience in consideration of my having surrendered such a considerable proportion of my legal right. But, my very dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> — you see how insinuatingly I put it — do pray transact, direct, and steer all my business without waiting for directions from me. For though my balances are sufficient for the discharge of debts, still it often happens that debtors don't come up to time. If anything of that sort occurs, don't regard anything as of more importance than my reputation. Preserve my credit not only by raising a fresh loan, but even by selling if necessary. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> was gratified by your letter. For I spent several hours with him at <a href=/people/4624 target=_blank>Nesis</a> shortly after having received your letter. He seemed delighted with your account of the <a href=/people/682 target=_blank>Tereus</a>, and to be more obliged to <a href=/people/1390 target=_blank>Accius</a> than to <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. In my eyes, however, the better the news the more annoyance and regret I feel that the Roman people uses up its hands in clapping, rather than in defending the constitution. To my mind, indeed, that party appears to be even more inspired to give an immediate display of their own disloyalty. However, so that they feel a pang, no matter what. I am not sorry to hear your remark about my designs being daily more commended, and I was looking forward to hear what you had to say about it. For I myself was hearing remarks made in different senses. Nay, more, I was letting it drag on expressly to avoid committing myself as long as possible. But since I am being turned out with a pitchfork, I am now thinking of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>. For the avoidance of the legions is easier and more certain than that of the <a href=/people/10975 target=_blank>pirates</a>, who are said to be showing themselves. <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> was expected on the 10th, but he has not come, as far as I know. <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> has arrived with his little fleet. On the 11th, after having seen him, I am thinking of going to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a> and thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411150UAec class=place long=15.013 lat=41.0534>Aeculanum</a>. You know the rest of the road. As to <a href=/people/7020 target=_blank>Tutia</a> — that's what I thought. About <a href=/people/2381 target=_blank>Aebutius</a>, I don't believe it, but I do not care any more than you do. I have written of course to <a href=/people/505 target=_blank>Plancus</a> and <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, since you asked me to do so. But don't think it necessary to deliver the letters, if you consider it better not. For, as they have acted entirely from consideration for you, I fear my letters may appear superfluous — at any rate to <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>, whom I know to be devotedly attached to you. However, just as you choose. As you say that you mean to winter in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, I shall be very grateful if you arrive there before the time comes at which by your advice I am to return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. Write to me as often as possible: if it is on matters of little importance, employ any messenger you get hold of; but if it is more urgent, send one of your own men. If I get safe to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>, I shall attempt something in the vein of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a>. I am sending you my de Gloria. You will therefore please to keep it under lock and key as usual: but let select passages be marked for <a href=/people/1677 target=_blank>Salvius</a> at least to read when he has got some fitting hearers at a dinner party. I like them much; I should wish you to do the same. Goodbye! Good-bye! </p>                        </div>

XVI, 3) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) POMPEII, 17 JULY: YOU acted wisely — I am now at length answering the letter you sent me after meeting Lucius <a href=/people/347 target=_blank>Antonius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a> — well then, you acted wisely in surrendering and even going so far as to thank him. For certainly, as you say, we shall be stripped of the constitution sooner than of our property. Your saying that you take more and more delight in my essay on <a href=/people/2313 target=_blank>Old Age</a> increases my energy in writing. You say that you are expecting <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> not to come to you empty-handed. I am glad that you were not disappointed in that expectation: but nevertheless I am sending you the same essay somewhat more carefully revised — and it is indeed the original copy itself with interlineations and corrections in many places. Get this copied on large paper and read it privately to your guests, but, as you love me, when they are cheerful and have had a good dinner, lest they vent their wrath on me, though really angry with you. With my son I only hope things are as I am told. About <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a> I shall learn when I see him: however, I don't think he has acted in any way with carelessness or meanness. About <a href=/people/1266 target=_blank>Herodes</a> I will do as you charge me, and I shall get information as to what you mention from <a href=/people/2443 target=_blank>Saufeius</a> and <a href=/people/1798 target=_blank>Xeno</a>. As to young Quintus, I am glad that you got my letter sent by my letter-carrier before the one delivered by himself — though in any case you would not have been taken in. Yet, after all-well, I am anxious to hear what he said to you and what you said in your turn: I don't doubt you both spoke characteristically. But I hope <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> will deliver that letter to me. He is in himself indeed an attractive person and a man I like, but now he will have the crowning grace of your recommendation. I have answered your letter sufficiently. Now listen to what, though I know it is not necessary to write, I yet am going to write. Many things distress me in my departure-first and foremost, by heaven, that I am being separated from you. But I am also distressed by the fatigue of the voyage, so unsuitable not only to my time of life, but also to my rank. Moreover, the time of my departure is rather ridiculous. I am leaving peace to return to war; and the season which might have been spent in my favourite country places — so prettily built and so full of charm — I am wasting on a foreign tour. The consolations are that I shall either do my son some good, or make up my mind how much good he is capable of receiving. In the next place you will — as I hope and as you promise-presently be there. If that happens indeed things will be better all round. But what gives me more uneasiness than anything is the making up of my balances. Though they have been put straight, yet since <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>'s debt is on the list, and among the debtors assigned to me are some unknown persons, I feel quite at sea, and this matter gives me more uneasiness than everything else. Accordingly, I don't think I have been wrong to write to <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> more openly than usual, to ask him that, if it should so happen that the debts did not come in at the proper time, he should come to the rescue; and telling him that I had commissioned you, in case of such an occurrence, to communicate with him. Please do so, if you think proper, and all the more if you are starting for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>. I write this when on the point of embarking from my Pompeian house with three ten-oared pinnaces. <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> is still at <a href=/people/4624 target=_blank>Nesis</a>, <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. Can you love <a href=/people/1110 target=_blank>Deiotarus</a> and yet dislike <a href=/people/9510 target=_blank>Hieras</a>? When Blesamius came to me about it, though he was charged not to take any step except on the advice of our friend Sextus <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a>, he never communicated with him or with any one of our party. I should like to kiss our dear <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, far off as she is, so delighted was I with the good wishes she sent me by you.

XVI, 6) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) VIBO, 25 JULY: As yet — for I have got as far as <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>'s house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387161HVib class=place long=16.1234 lat=38.715>Vibo</a> — I have prosecuted my voyage with more comfort than energy. For the greater part has been done by rowing, and there have been no nor'-nor'-easters. That has been rather lucky, for there were two bays to be crossed, that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/404150PPos class=place long=15.0056 lat=40.4229>Paestum</a> and that of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/387161HVib class=place long=16.1234 lat=38.715>Vibo</a>. We crossed both with sheets taut. I arrived at <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>'s house therefore on the eighth day from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>, having rested one day at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402152PEle class=place long=15.155 lat=40.1608>Velia</a>. There I stayed at our friend <a href=/people/10346 target=_blank>Talna</a>'s house, and couldn't possibly have been received more hospitably-especially as <a href=/people/10346 target=_blank>Talna</a> himself was away from home. So on the 24th I went to <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>'s house. There I found myself quite at home. So I put on an extra day to my visit. But I think when I reach <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> I shall consider — being On long and weary sea voyage bent whether to make for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382217PPat class=place long=21.74 lat=38.245>Patrae</a> on a merchant vessel or to go as far as <a about=https://topostext.org/place/405172PTar class=demonym long=17.228 lat=40.476>Tarentine</a> Leucopetra on packet-boats, and thence to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/396199PKer class=place long=19.9156 lat=39.6063>Corcyra</a>: and if on the ship of burden, whether to go from the strait direct or from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a>. On this point I will write to you from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a>. By heaven, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, it often occurs to me to ask: What boots it you to journey hither thus? Why am I not with you? Why do I not see my pretty villas-those sweet eyes of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>? But it is enough and to spare that I am losing you. And from what am I running away? Is it danger? But of that at the present moment, if I do not mistake, there is none. For it is precisely to that which you use your influence to bid me return. For you say that my quitting the country is praised to the skies, but only on the understanding that I return before the 1st of January. That I shall certainly try to do; for I had rather be at home even in fear, than at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> without it. But look out to see to what things at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> are tending, and either write me news of them or, as I should much prefer, bring it with you in person. Enough of this. I hope you will not be annoyed at my next request, which I know is a subject of more anxiety to you than to myself: in heaven's name, set straight and clear up my debtor and creditor accounts. I have left an excellent balance, but there is need of careful attention. See that my co-heirs are paid for the Cluvian property on the 1st of August; and what terms I ought to make with <a href=/people/2657 target=_blank>Publilius</a>. He ought not to press, as I am not taking full advantage of my legal privileges: but, after all, I much wish him also to be satisfied. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, again — what am I to assign to her? Pay her even before the day if you can. But if — as I hope-you are quickly coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe class=place long=20.5 lat=39.5>Epirus</a>, I beg you to provide before you start for what I owe on security, to put it straight and leave it fully discharged. But enough on these matters, and I fear you will think too much. Now just notice my carelessness. I have sent you a book On <a href=/people/1497 target=_blank>Glory</a>: but there is the same preface in it as in the third book of the Academics. That results from the fact that I keep a volume of prefaces. From it I am accustomed to select one when I have begun some treatise. So being at the time at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, as I did not remember that I had already used that preface, I put it into the book which I sent you. When, however, I was reading the Academics on board ship, I noticed my mistake. Accordingly, I have written out a new preface, and am sending it to you. Please cut the other one off and glue this on. Give my love to <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, my pet and darling. </p>                        </div>

XVI, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ON BOARD SHIP, 19 AUGUST: Having started on the 6th of August from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380156ULeu class=place long=15.6358 lat=38.0178>Leucopetra</a> — for that was to be my port of embarkation — when I had made about furlongs, I was driven back upon that same <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380156ULeu class=place long=15.6358 lat=38.0178>Leucopetra</a> by a violent south wind. While waiting there for a change of wind — I was staying in the villa of our friend <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a>, where I am quite at home and comfortable-certain men of high rank from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381156PRhe class=place long=15.644 lat=38.109>Rhegium</a> came thither, having lately returned from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, among others a friend of our <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, who (as he told me) had left <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408142PNea class=place long=14.24 lat=40.843>Naples</a>. They brought, first, an edict of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>; secondly, intelligence that there would be a full meeting of the senate on the 1st, and that a despatch had been sent by <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> to all ex-Consuls and ex-praetors asking them to be present. They announced also that there was a great hope of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> yielding, an arrangement being Come to, and our partisans returning to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. They added also that I was wanted, and that my absence was being somewhat unfavourably criticised. On hearing these news I without hesitation threw aside my design of leaving the country, which, by heaven! I had never really liked. When, however, I read your letter, I was of course surprised that you had so entirely changed your opinion, but I thought that you must have some good reason for it. However, though you had never advised nor urged my leaving the country, you had at least expressed approval of my doing so, provided that I returned to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> by the 1st of January. The result of that would have been that I should have been abroad as long as the danger seemed less imminent, but have returned to find everything in a blaze. But this advice, however short-sighted, I have no claim to resent; because in the first place what I did was in accordance with my own opinion; and in the second place, even if it were adopted on your suggestion, for what is an adviser responsible except good faith? It is the following expression of yours at which I cannot sufficiently wonder: Can you with honour, you who talk of a noble death — can you with honour abandon your country? Was I abandoning it, or did I seem to you at that time to be abandoning it? Why, you not only did not forbid my doing what I was doing, but even expressed approval. Still severer is what you say afterwards: I wish you would elaborate for me some precis of the reasons justifying your action. Is it really so, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>? Does my action need a defence, and with you of all people, who expressed such strong approval of it? I of course will compose the defence which you require, but addressed to some one of those against whose wish and advice I started. Vet, what need now of a precis? If I had persevered, there would have been such need. But, say you, this very fact is an instance of vacillation. No philosopher ever yet — and there has been a great deal written upon the subject-defined a mere change of plan as vacillation. So next you say: For if the change had been made by our friend <a href=/people/473 target=_blank>Phaedrus</a>, your defence would have been easy. As it is, what answer are we to make? So then my action was one which I could not justify to <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, that is, was criminal and disgraceful — is that so? I only wish you had been of that opinion from the first! You would have been my <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, as you ever are! But your last sentence is the most I might say exasperating: For our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> says nothing '-that is to say, does not venture to remonstrate with a man of my age. I can't imagine what else you Can mean by those words, and by heaven that is it! For on the 17th of August, on my arrival at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402152PEle class=place long=15.155 lat=40.1608>Velia</a>, <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> heard of it. He was with his ships in the river Hales, three miles north of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/402152PEle class=place long=15.155 lat=40.1608>Velia</a>. He immediately walked over to see me. Good heavens! with what transports of delight at my return, or rather at my abandonment of the journey, did he pour out all that he had repressed before! It made me recall those words of yours, For our friend <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> holds his tongue. But what he most regretted was that I had not been in the senate on the 1st of August. He praised <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a> to the skies, but remarked that he was delighted at my having avoided two grounds of reproach. One of these I was well aware that I was incurring by this journey — that of despairing of and abandoning the Republic. Many people remonstrated with me upon it with tears in their eyes, and I was unable to console them by promising a quick return. The other was one in regard to which <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and his following — and its number was large-were much pleased: I mean that I escaped the reproach of being thought to be going to attend the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> games. There Could be nothing more unbecoming than this at any period of the Republic, but at this particular crisis it would have been entirely unjustifiable. So I am grateful to the South wind for having saved me from such a scandal. There you have the avowed motives for my turning back. They are indeed sound and weighty ones, but none could be really sounder than what you yourself said in another letter: Take measures in case of any creditor you may have, that there is enough to pay every man his due. For owing to the feat of war the money market is wonderfully tight. I read that letter when I was in the middle of the strait, with the result that I could think of no way of making such provision, except by being on the spot to support my own credit. But enough of this, the rest when we meet. I got hold of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s edict from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> and read it, as well as our friends' splendid answer to it. But I do not clearly see the use or object of these edicts: and I am not now, as <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> thought I ought to do, coming to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with a view of entering upon politics. For what can be done? Did anyone back up <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>? Did he come to the house again next day himself? But after all a man of my age ought not to be far from his place of burial, as people say. But, I beseech you, what is this that I hear from <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>? He said that you had written to say that <a href=/people/1319 target=_blank>Pilia</a> was suffering from paralysis. I was much alarmed, although he added that you also said that you hoped she was better. I devoutly trust so! Give her my very kindest remembrances, as also to my dearest <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>.

XV, 13) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 25 OCTOBER: On the 25th I received two letters from you. I will therefore answer the earlier one first. I agree with you: but I would neither lead the van or bring up the rear, and yet be on that side in sympathy. I am sending you my speech. As to whether it is to be kept locked up or published, I leave the decision to you. But when shall we see the day when you shall think that it ought to be published? I cannot see the possibility of the truce which you mention. Better a masterly silence, which I think I shall employ. You say that two legions have arrived at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406179PBru class=place long=17.947 lat=40.641>Brundisium</a>: you in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> get all news first. So please write and tell me whatever you hear. I am anxious for <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s Dialogue. I am now all for writing something in the <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a> style, especially as you like it so much. But I should like to know the sort you want. As to what I said to you before (or previously — as you prefer to express it), you have, to confess the honest truth, made me keener for writing. For to your own opinion, with which I was already acquainted, you have added the authority of <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a> — a very high one in my eyes, and among the most weighty. I will therefore do my best to prevent your feeling the lack either of industry or accuracy on my part. Yes, as you suggest in your letter, I am keeping up with <a href=/people/3989 target=_blank>Vettienus</a> and <a href=/people/2049 target=_blank>Faberius</a>. I don't think <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> meant any harm, although. But it is all one! As to the maintenance of liberty — surely the most precious thing in the world — I agree with you. So it is <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>'s turn now, is it? What a rascal he is! That's the only word for him. Oh cautious <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>! I am the same-yet not after all the most cautious of men! I have answered your longer and earlier letter. Now for the shorter and later one — what answer am I to make except that it was a most delightful one? Events in Spain are going very well. If I do but see Balbilius safe and sound, I shall have a support for my old age. As to the estate of <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> your opinion is mine. Visellia shows me great attention. But that's the way of the world. Of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a> you say that you know nothing: but <a href=/people/1641 target=_blank>Servilia</a> says that Marcus <a href=/people/1570 target=_blank>Scaptius</a> has arrived, and that he will pay her a secret visit at her house without any parade, and that I shall know everything. Meanwhile, she also tells me that a slave of <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a> has arrived to announce that the legions at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a> are in arms; that <a href=/people/837 target=_blank>Bassus</a> is being summoned; <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>'s arrival looked for with eagerness. In short, the Republic seems about to recover its legitimate authority. But no shouting before we are out of the wood!

He has won over to his views all the veterans at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411142UCas class=place long=14.2089 lat=41.1099>Casilinum</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410144UCal class=place long=14.356 lat=41.0428>Calatia</a>. And no wonder: he gives a bounty of denarii apiece. Clearly, his view is a war with <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> under his leadership. So I perceive that before many days are over we shall be in arms. But whom are we to follow? Consider his name, consider his age! Again, to begin with, he demands a secret interview with me, at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a> of all places! It is really quite childish if he supposes that it can be kept private. I have written to explain to him that it is neither necessary nor practicable. He sent a certain <a href=/people/2213 target=_blank>Caecina</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/434109UVol class=person long=10.86 lat=43.4035>Volaterrae</a> to me, an intimate friend of his own, who brought me the news that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> was on his way towards the city with the legion <a href=/people/8753 target=_blank>Alauda</a>, was imposing a money contribution on the municipal towns, and was marching at the head of the legion with colours flying. He wanted my opinion whether he should start for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with his army of 3,000 veterans, or should hold <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, and so intercept <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>'s advance, or should join the three <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=demonym long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonian</a> legions now sailing by the Mare <a href=/people/10331 target=_blank>Superum</a>, which he hopes are devoted to himself. They refused to accept a bounty offered them by <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>, as my informant at least says. They even used grossly insulting language to him, and moved off when he attempted to address them. In short, <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a> offers himself as our military leader, and thinks that our right policy is to stand by him. On my part I advised his making for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. For I think that he will have not only the city mob, but, if he can impress them with confidence, the loyalists also on his side. Oh, <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>, where are you? What an opportunity you are losing I For my part I did not foresee this, but I thought that something of the sort would happen. Now, I desire to have your advice. Shall I come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> or stay on here? Or am I to fly to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a>? There is a sense of security about that place! My opinion is — <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, lest my absence should be remarked, if people think that a blow has been struck. Unravel this difficulty. I was never in greater perplexity. </p>                        </div>

His present view is that I should come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> at once: and that he wishes to act through the senate. I told him that a meeting of the senate was impossible before the 1st of January: and I believe it is really so. But he adds also: And by your advice. In short, he insists: while I suspend judgment. I don't trust his youth. I am in the dark as to his disposition. I am not willing to do anything without your friend <a href=/people/644 target=_blank>Pansa</a>. I am afraid of <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> succeeding, and I don't like going far from the sea: and at the same time I fear some great coup without my being there. <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>, for his part, doesn't like the youth's plan. I don't agree with him. He has forces on which he can depend. He can count on <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>, and is making no secret of his intentions. He is organizing his men in companies at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>; he is paying them their bounty-money. War seems to be ever coming nearer and nearer. Do answer this letter. I am surprised that my letter-carrier left <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 1st without anything from you. </p>                        </div>

XVI, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) PUTEOLI, 5 NOVEMBER: I RECEIVED two letters from you on the 5th, one dated on the 1st, the other on the day previous. So first for the earlier one. I am delighted that you like my pamphlet, from which you have picked the plums. They seem all the more brilliant to my eyes for your approval of them. For I was mortally afraid of those little red wax wafers of yours As to <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>, it is as you say. I could scarcely refrain from the subject you mention. So I will pass over the matter lightly, and without fixing any opprobrium upon <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a> and Septimia, only just enough to let our children's children know, without any Lucilian ambiguity, that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> had had children by the daughter of <a href=/people/1943 target=_blank>Fadius</a> <a href=/people/276 target=_blank>Gallus</a>. And I only wish I may live to see the day when that oration may have such free circulation in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> as to find its way even into <a href=/people/1907 target=_blank>Sicca</a>'s house. But we must have a return to the state of things under the triumvirs! Hang me, if that isn't a good joke! However, please read it to Sextus <a href=/people/1957 target=_blank>Peducaeus</a>, and write and tell me his opinion of it. Better his one than ten thousand in my eyes. Be on your guard against the appearance of <a href=/people/1443 target=_blank>Calenus</a> and Calvena on the scene. You fear that I shall think you long-winded. who less so? As <a href=/people/73 target=_blank>Aristophanes</a> thought of the iambics of <a href=/people/384 target=_blank>Archilochus</a> — the longest letter from you ever seems the best. As to your admonishing me  — why, even if you reprimanded me, I should bear it not merely with patience, but with real pleasure, for in your reprimand there were both wisdom and kindly purpose. Therefore I shall cheerfully correct faults pointed out by you. I will write by the same right as you did the property of <a href=/people/1903 target=_blank>Rubrius</a>, instead of the property of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>: and I will soften down my excessive praise of <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>. Yet, after all, there seems a very neat piece of irony in saying that he had fought three battles against his fellow citizens. Again, I prefer your suggestion: It is the most inequitable thing in the world that this man should be living to What could be more inequitable? I am not jealous of your admiring <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s Peplographia. But I haven't yet got out of him his Essay in the style of <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heracleides</a>. You urge me to write. It is very friendly of you, but the fact is I do nothing else. I am very sorry to hear of your cold. Pray attend to it with all your accustomed care. I am very glad my Oh Titus does you good. The men of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417132UAna class=place long=13.1589 lat=41.7422>Anagnia</a> are <a href=/people/4221 target=_blank>Mustela</a>, captain of his ruffians, and <a href=/people/9652 target=_blank>Laco</a> who is a notorious toper. The book for which you ask me I will polish up and send you. Now for your later letter. The de <a href=/people/6717 target=_blank>Officiis</a> — as far as <a href=/people/959 target=_blank>Panaetius</a> goes — I have completed in two books. His treatise is in three. But at the beginning he had defined the cases in which duty has to be determined to be three: one when we deliberate as to whether a thing is right or wrong; another whether it is expedient or inexpedient; and a third when there seems to be a contest between the right and the expedient; on what principle we are to decide-as, for instance, in the case of <a href=/people/512 target=_blank>Regulus</a>, it was right to return, expedient to stay. Well, having begun by defining these three categories, he discussed the first two in brilliant style; on the third he promised an essay in due course, but never wrote it. That topic was taken up by <a href=/people/457 target=_blank>Posidonius</a>. I, however, both sent for the latter's book, and also wrote to <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a> <a href=/people/1937 target=_blank>Calvus</a> to send me an analysis of it. I am now waiting for this, and I should be obliged if you would give him a reminder and ask him to send it as soon as possible. In that treatise there are remarks upon relative duty. As to your question about the title, I have no doubt about officium representing καθῆκον — unless you have something else to suggest — but the fuller title is de <a href=/people/6717 target=_blank>Officiis</a>. Finally, I address it to my son. It seemed to me to be not inappropriate. About <a href=/people/841 target=_blank>Myrtilus</a> you make all clear. Oh, what a vivid picture you always give of that set! Does he really try to implicate <a href=/people/11075 target=_blank>Decimus Brutus</a>? Heaven confound them! I have not gone into hiding at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/407145PPom class=place long=14.4848 lat=40.7493>Pompeii</a>, as I told you I should do. In the first place owing to the weather, which has been most abominable; and in the second because I get a letter from <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a> every day, begging me to undertake the business, to come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/411143PCap class=place long=14.25 lat=41.086>Capua</a>, once more to save the Republic, and in any case to go at once to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: Ashamed to shrink and yet afraid to take. After all, his action has been extremely vigorous, and still is so. He will come to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> with a large body of men, but he is very green. He thinks he can have a meeting of the senate at once. Who will come to it? Who, if he does come, will venture to oppose <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> in the present undecided state of things? On the 1st of January he will perhaps be a protection to them, or before that time a pitched battle will perhaps be fought. The municipal towns show astonishing enthusiasm for the boy. For instance, on his way into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/413148RSam class=place long=14.8 lat=41.3>Samnium</a> he came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UCal class=place long=14.1322 lat=41.2>Cales</a> and stopped at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/412141UTea class=place long=14.0673 lat=41.2521>Teanum</a>. There was a wonderful procession to meet him, and loud expressions of encouragement. Would you have thought that? It makes me resolve to go to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> earlier than I had intended. As soon as I have made up my mind, I will write. Though I have not yet read the terms of agreement — for <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> has not yet arrived-yet I would have you settle the business on the 12th. I shall be able to send letters to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375151PCat class=place long=15.0881 lat=37.503>Catina</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379153PTau class=place long=15.2921 lat=37.8523>Tauromenium</a>, and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371153PSyr class=place long=15.293 lat=37.0639>Syracuse</a> with greater ease, if <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> the interpreter will send me the names of the influential people. For such men vary from time to time, and our special friends are mostly dead. However, I have written some circular letters for <a href=/people/141 target=_blank>Valerius</a> to use if he chooses, or he must send me names. About the holidays for <a href=/people/128 target=_blank>Lepidus</a>'s inauguration, <a href=/people/334 target=_blank>Balbus</a> tells me that they will extend to the 30th. I shall look anxiously for a letter from you, and I think I shall learn about that little affair of <a href=/people/726 target=_blank>Torquatus</a>. I am forwarding you a letter from Quintus, to show you how strongly attached he is to the youth, whom it vexes him that you do not love enough. As <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a> is inclined to be merry — the best sign in children-give her a kiss for me. </p>                        </div>

As to <a href=/people/4629 target=_blank>Ocella</a>, while you are dallying about and never writing me a line I have taken the law into my own hands. So I think I shall be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the 12th. It seems to me to be better to be there for nothing, though it may not be absolutely necessary, than not to be there if it is. And at the same time I am afraid of being cut off from a return. For <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> may be already on his way thither, for there are various rumours afloat, and many of them which I only wish were true. There is, however, nothing certain But for my part, whatever the truth may be, I would rather be with you than be in suspense both for you and myself, owing to my absence from you. But what am I to say to you? Cheer up! As to <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a>'s Heracleidean work — it is really rather comic! I was never so tickled with anything.

XVI, 14) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM (NOVEMBER) I have absolutely nothing to write about. For when I was at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a> there was always something new about <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a>, much also that was false about <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a>. However, in regard to what you have said in your letters — for I received three from you on the 11th — I quite agree with you that, if <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a> gets much power, the acta of the tyrant will be confirmed much more decisively than they were in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125STel class=place long=12.4899 lat=41.892>temple</a> of <a href=/people/12080 target=_blank>Tellus</a>, and that this will be against the interests of <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>. Yes, but if he is beaten, you perceive that <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> becomes intolerable: so that you can't tell which to prefer. What a rascal that letter-carrier of <a href=/people/1099 target=_blank>Sestius</a> is! He said he would be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> on the day after leaving <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PDik class=place long=14.1253 lat=40.8259>Puteoli</a>. You advise me to move cautiously. Yes, I agree with you; though I had once other ideas. I am not influenced by <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philippus</a> or <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>. For their position is different; and if it isn't, it is nevertheless thought so. But though that young man has plenty of spirit, he lacks prestige. Nevertheless, consider whether I can be safely in my house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, and whether it would be better for me to be there. I should prefer it: for then I shall be up to date in my information. Or had I better stay here when <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> arrives? But to turn to another subject — I am quite satisfied that what the Greeks call καθῆκον (duty) we call officium. Now, why should you doubt of this being also applicable to the language of public life? Don't we speak of the officium of consuls, of senate, or of an imperator? It is eminently applicable: if not, suggest some other word. I am very sorry to hear your news about the son of <a href=/people/12142 target=_blank>Nepos</a>. I am much disturbed and sincerely sorry. I did not know that he had a son at all. I have lost <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a> — a man who, as far as I am concerned, was the reverse of ungrateful. There is no occasion for you to whip up <a href=/people/692 target=_blank>Athenodorus</a>: he has sent me a very good precis. Pray use every possible means to get rid of your cold. The great-grandson of your grandfather writes to the grandson of my father, that after the Nones, in which I made my, famous coup, he intends to unfold the story of the temple of <a href=/people/243 target=_blank>Ops</a>, and that too in the face of the whole people. You will look out, therefore, and write me word. I am anxious to hear the criticism of Sextus. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057:Att.16.15'><b>&sect; Att.16.15</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;DCCCIV (Att. XVI, 15) TO ATTICUS (AT ROME) ARPINUM (BETWEEN I I NOVEMBER AND 9 DECEMBER) Don't put it down to idleness that I do not write with my own hand — and yet, by heaven, do put it down to idleness; for I have no other excuse to give: and, after all, I think I recognize the hand of <a href=/people/220 target=_blank>Alexis</a> in your letters. But to come to business. If <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a> had not treated me in the most dishonourable manner, I should perhaps have considered whether to be somewhat easy with him or to press for my strict rights. As it is, however, I even rejoice that an opportunity has been presented me of making both him and everybody else perceive that I have become alienated from him. I will avow it openly, and show indeed that it is not only for my own sake, but for that of the Republic also, that I detest him: because, after having undertaken under my advice to support it, he has not only deserted it for a money bribe, but has also, as far as in him lay, contributed to its ruin. Well, you ask what proceedings I wish to be taken. As soon as the day comes, I should like them to be of such a nature as to make it natural for me to be at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. But in regard to that, as in regard to everything else, I will yield to your opinion. On the main question, however, I wish the matter pressed with all vigour and severity. Though it does not look well to call upon sureties for payment, yet I would have you consider how far such a step is justifiable. For it is open to me, with a view to his sureties being eventually called upon, to bring his agents into the case. I am sure the latter will not defend the suit. Though, if they do, I am aware that the sureties are thereby relieved from obligation. But I think that it would be a stigma on him not to free his agents from a debt for which he gave security; and that my character requires me to enforce my right without inflicting signal disgrace upon him. Pray write and tell me what you think of this. I have no doubt that you will conduct the whole case with all proper mildness. I return to public affairs. I have received — heaven knows — many a prudent word from you under the head of politics, but never anything wiser than your last letter: Though that youth is powerful and has given <a href=/people/10 target=_blank>Antony</a> a fine check: yet, after all, we must wait to see the end. Why, what a speech! It has been sent to me. He qualifies his oath by the words: So may I attain to the honours of my father ! and at the same time he held out his right hand in the direction of his statue. Nec servatoribus istis! But, as you say in your letter, the most certain source of danger I see to be the tribuneship of this <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> of ours. This is what I spoke about to <a href=/people/755 target=_blank>Oppius</a>. When he urged me to open my arms to the young man, the whole cause, and the levy of veterans, I replied that I could by no means do so unless I was completely satisfied that he would be not only not hostile to the tyrannicides, but actually their friend. When he remarked that it would be so, I said, What is our hurry then? For <a href=/people/2432 target=_blank>Octavian</a> does not require my services till the 1st of January: whereas we meanwhile shall learn his disposition before the 13th of December in the case of <a href=/people/1659 target=_blank>Casca</a>. He cordially assented. Wherefore, so far so good. For the rest you shall have a letter-carrier every day, and, as I think, you will have something to write to me every day. I inclose a copy of Lepta's letter, from which I gather that that braggart captain has lost his footing. But you will judge when you read it. P.S. — When I had already sealed this letter I got one from you and Sextus. Nothing could be more delightful and loving than Sextus's letter. For yours was only a short note. Your previous one was fuller of matter. Your advice is as prudent as it is friendly — that I should remain in this neighbourhood by preference, until I hear how the present movements end. But for myself, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, it isn't the Republic that at this moment gives me great anxiety-not because there is anything dearer than it in my eyes or ought to be so, but <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> himself forbids medical treatment in desperate cases. So good-bye to all that! It is my personal property that affects me. Property, do I say? Nay, rather my personal reputation. For great as my balances are, I have not yet realized enough even to pay <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>. <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, do I say? You know that we some time ago settled to pay twenty-five sestertia for the debt to <a href=/people/3430 target=_blank>Montanus</a>. My son, from a very keen sense of honour, asked us to pay this out of his allowance: and very liberal too it was of him, as you also thought. I promised him, and told <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> to earmark it. Not only did he not do so; but <a href=/people/11042 target=_blank>Aurelius</a> was forced to raise a fresh loan at a most oppressive rate of interest. For as to the debt to <a href=/people/874 target=_blank>Terentia</a>, Tiro wrote me word that you said that there would be cash from <a href=/people/148 target=_blank>Dolabella</a>. I believe that he misunderstood you — if ever a man did misunderstand — or rather that he did not understand anything about it. For you wrote and told me the answer made by <a href=/people/2220 target=_blank>Cocceius</a>, and so did <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Eros</a> in nearly the same words. We must come therefore to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> — however hot the conflagration. For personal insolvency is more discreditable than public disaster. Accordingly, on the other subjects, on which you wrote to me in a most charming style, I was too completely upset to be able to reply in my usual way. Give your mind to enabling me to extricate myself from the anxiety in which I now am. By what measures I am to do so, some ideas do occur to my mind, but I can settle nothing for certain until I have seen you. Why should I be less safe at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> than <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>? But that is not now the question; nor is that the thing about which I am chiefly anxious. You see what is occupying my thoughts. I am with you directly therefore. </p>                        </div>
