His grandfather, named <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> also, attained to a second consulship, was prefect of the city, and was enrolled among the patricians by <a href=/people/492 target=_blank>Vespasian</a> and <a href=/people/5289 target=_blank>Titus</a> while they were censors. 3 <a href=/people/1125 target=_blank>Annius</a> <a href=/people/788 target=_blank>Libo</a>, a consul, was his uncle, <a href=/people/5012 target=_blank>Galeria</a> <a href=/people/3838 target=_blank>Faustina</a> <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a>, his aunt.

For when he was twelve years old he adopted the dress and, a little later, the hardiness of a philosopher, pursuing his studies clad in a rough Greek cloak and sleeping on the ground; at his mother's solicitation, however, he reluctantly consented to sleep on a couch strewn with skins. 7 He received instruction, furthermore, from the teacher of that <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> who was destined later to be a kinsman of his, namely <a href=/people/333 target=_blank>Apollonius</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410290PCha class=person long=29.0258 lat=40.9834>Chalcedon</a>, the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoic</a>; </p>                        </div>

On his teachers in general, moreover, he conferred great honours, for he even kept golden statues of them in his chapel, and made it a custom to show respect for their tombs by personal visits and by offerings of sacrifices and flowers. 6 He studied jurisprudence as well, in which he heard Lucius <a href=/people/2797 target=_blank>Volusius</a> Maecianus, 7 and so much work and labour did he devote to his studies that he impaired his health — the only fault to be found with his entire childhood. 8 He attended also the public schools of rhetoricians. Of his fellow-pupils he was particularly fond of <a href=/people/2544 target=_blank>Seius</a> Fuscianus and <a href=/people/2293 target=_blank>Aufidius</a> <a href=/people/3713 target=_blank>Victorinus</a>, of the senatorial order, and <a href=/people/836 target=_blank>Baebius</a> <a href=/people/1840 target=_blank>Longus</a> and <a href=/people/1443 target=_blank>Calenus</a>, of the equestrian. 9 He was very generous to these men, so generous, in fact, that on those whom he could not advance to public office on account of their station in life, he bestowed riches. </p>                        </div>

He was also fond of boxing and wrestling and running and fowling, played ball very skilfully, and hunted well. 10 But his ardour for philosophy distracted him from all these pursuits and made him serious and dignified, not ruining, however, a certain geniality in him, which he still manifested toward his household, his friends, and even to those less intimate, but making him, rather, austere, though not unreasonable, modest, though not inactive, and serious without gloom. </p>                        </div>

Later, while rendering thanks to the senate for his brother's deification, he darkly hinted that all the strategic plans whereby the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar class=ethnic long=58.5 lat=37>Parthians</a> had been overcome were his own. 3 He added, besides, certain statements in which he indicated that now at length he would make a fresh beginning in the management of the state, now that <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>, who had seemed somewhat negligent, was removed. 4 And the senate took this precisely as it was said, so that <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a> seemed to be giving thanks that <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> had departed this life. 5 Afterwards he bestowed many privileges and much honour and money on all <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a>' sisters, kin, and freedmen. For he was exceedingly solicitous about his good reputation, indeed he was wont to ask what men really said of him, and to correct whatever seemed justly blamed. <br />6 Just before setting out for the German war, and before the period of mourning had yet expired, he married his daughter to <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> <a href=/people/11060 target=_blank>Pompeianus</a>, the son of a Roman knight, and now advanced in years, a native of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, whose birth was not sufficiently noble (though <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a> later made him consul twice), 7 since <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a>' daughter was an <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a> and the daughter of an <a href=/people/964 target=_blank>Augusta</a>.

And because the games of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> Optimus <a href=/people/11092 target=_blank>Maximus</a> were then in progress 5 and he did not wish to have them interrupted by public mourning, he merely ordered that statues should be decreed for his dead son, that a golden image of him should be carried in procession at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125BCiM class=place long=12.4871 lat=41.8852>Circus</a>, and that his name should be inserted in the song of the Salii. <br />6 And since the pestilence was still raging at this time, he both zealously revived the worship of the gods and trained slaves for military service — just as had been done in the Punic war — whom he called Volunteers, after the example of the Volones. 7 He armed gladiators also, calling them the Compliant, and turned even the bandits of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435167RDal class=place long=16.7 lat=43.5>Dalmatia</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401264UDar class=place long=26.3725 lat=40.086>Dardania</a> into soldiers.

Once, indeed, he rebuked a praetor who heard the pleas of accused men in too summary a fashion, and ordered him to hold the trials again, saying that it was a matter of concern to the honour of the accused that they should be heard by a judge who really represented the people. 3 He scrupulously observed justice, moreover, even in his dealings with captive enemies.

During this time the behaviour of his son steadily fell away from the standard the Emperor had set for himself. 10 For three years thereafter he waged war with the <a href=/people/11059 target=_blank>Marcomanni</a>, the <a href=/people/7760 target=_blank>Hermunduri</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sarmatians</a>, and the <a href=/people/11070 target=_blank>Quadi</a>, and had he lived a year longer he would have made these regions provinces. 11 Two days before his death, it is said, he summoned his friends and expressed the same opinion about his son that <a href=/people/30 target=_blank>Philip</a> expressed about <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> when he too thought poorly of his son, and added that it grieved him exceedingly to leave a son behind him. 12 For already <a href=/people/1471 target=_blank>Commodus</a> had made it clear that he was base and cruel. </p>                        </div>

The Fool asked the Slave the name of his wife's lover and the Slave answered <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> three times; and when the Fool kept on asking, the Slave replied, I have already told you thrice <a href=/people/928 target=_blank>Tullus</a> is his name. 3 But the city-populace and others besides talked a great deal about this incident and found fault with <a href=/people/508 target=_blank>Antoninus</a> for his forbearance. <br />4 Previous to his death, and before he returned to the <a href=/people/11059 target=_blank>Marcomannic</a> war, he swore in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125SCap class=place long=12.483 lat=41.8933>Capitol</a> that no senator had been executed with his knowledge and consent, and said that had he known he would have spared even the insurgents. 5 Nothing did he fear and deprecate more than a reputation for covetousness, a charge of which he tried to clear himself in many letters. 6 Some maintain — and held it a fault — that he was insincere and not as guileless as he seemed, indeed not as guileless as either <a href=/people/1456 target=_blank>Pius</a> or <a href=/people/1915 target=_blank>Verus</a> had been. 7 Others accused him of encouraging the arrogance of the court by keeping his friends from general social intercourse and from banquets. <br />8 His parents were deified at his command, and even his parents' friends, after their death, he honoured with statues. <br />9 He did not readily accept the version of those who were partisans in any matter, but always searched long and carefully for the truth. <br />10 After the death of <a href=/people/3838 target=_blank>Faustina</a>, Fabia tried to manoeuvre a marriage with him. But he took a concubine instead, the daughter of a steward of his wife's, rather than put a stepmother over so many children. </p>                        </div>
