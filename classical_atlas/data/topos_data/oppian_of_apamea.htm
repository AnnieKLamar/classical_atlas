But not equal is the venture: for how can these be equal — to draw the writhing fish from the deeps or hale the winged birds from the air and to contend with deadly wild beasts on the hills? Yet not for the fisherman either and truly not for the fowler is their hunting without toil. But their toil only pleasure attends and no bloodshed: unstained of gore are they. The angler sits on the rocks beside the sea and with curving rods and deadly hooks he catches, at his ease, the fish of varied sheen; and joy is his when he strikes home with barbs of bronze and sweeps through the air the writhing dancer of the sea, leaping high above the deeps. Yea and to the fowler his toil is sweet; for to their hunt the fowlers carry nor sword nor bill nor brazen spear, but the Hawk is their attendant when they travel to the woods, and the long cords and the clammy yellow birdlime and the reeds that tread an airy path. Who would dare to sing of these things as of equal weight? Or who would pit the <a href=/people/10980 target=_blank>Eagle</a> against the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> King? And who would liken the Muraena to the venom of the Pard, or Jackal to Hawk, or Rhinoceros to Sea-urchin, or Gull to Wild <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>Goat</a>, or any Sea-monster to the Elephant? Hunters kill Wolves, fishermen kill <a href=/people/10999 target=_blank>Tunnies</a>; the hunter with his net takes <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>Sheep</a>, the fowler with his reeds takes Doves; the hunter with his <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> takes the Bear, the angler takes the <a href=/people/7995 target=_blank>Mormyrus</a>; the mounted hunter takes the Tiger, the fisher with his trident takes the Red Mullet; the tracker takes the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Boar</a>, the fowler with his birdlime takes the Nightingale.

For the hunter must mount the noble <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> amid the rocks and anon must leap a ditch. And often in the woods must he with light feet and nimble limbs pursue the wild beast. Therefore let them not be stout who come to the warfare of the chase, nor yet over-lean; for at times the keen hunter must contend with warlike wild beasts. So I would have them bear a body tempered thus — both swift to run and strong to fight. And in the right hand let them brandish two long javelins and have a hunting-bill at the midst of their girdle. For you should both array bitter slaughter for wild beasts and also carry defences against evil men. With his left hand the hunter on foot should lead his <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>; with his left the mounted hunter should guide the bridle that steers his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>.

With naked feet should they travel who study dim tracks of wild beasts, lest the noise of their sandals grating under their sleek feet drive sleep from the eyes of the wild beasts. To have no mantle at all were much better; since many a time a cloak stirred by the breath of the noisy wind alarms the wild beasts and they start up to flee. Thus let hunters well array the agile body; for such doth the archer daughter of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a> love. <br />Other times at other hour let them go after the wild beasts — at rising morn and when the day wanes and at mid-day and anon at evening; sometimes again even in the dark they slay wild beasts by the rays of the moon. The whole span of day is favourable and fair to the hunter for all-day coursing in leafy spring and in autumn when the leaves fall. For excellent well tempered for the running of <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and men and carrion <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> are the seasons in golden spring which puts to rout the chilly clouds; when the sea is navigable for seafaring men, who spread the white rigging of their canvas-winged ships, what time the earth rejoices in them that tend plants; when, too, she looses the bands of bud and flower; or again in late autumn when the year is on the turn, when the house of the rustic vintager flourishes; when the fruit of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a> fills the shining pail and the clusters of the garden vines joyfully straiten the wine-vats; when the lilywhite combs fill the hives of the <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a>. But in mid-winter let the hunters hunt at mid-day, in the season when in the woods the swain shelters in a cave and gathering dry sticks and piling a swiftly dying flame lies down beside the fire and makes his supper. And in summer the hunter must shun the fiery assault and heat of the sun: at earliest dawn I bid him come to his task, when in the morning the countrymen with well-fashioned stilt guide the earth-cutting plough behind the steers beneath the pole; or again at evening when the sun slopes his team toward the West; when herdsmen command their herds what time they travel homeward to their folds, heavy of breast and swollen of udder; and, bounding incontinently from the stone-built steading, all leap about their beloved mothers — the bright-eyed calves about the large-eyed <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cows</a>, the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lambs</a> about the bleating horned ewes, the <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>kids</a> about the bleating <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a>, and about the brood mares their swift foals. </p>                        </div>

How with unwinking eyes doth he look upon the dense array of armed warriors, the gleaming bronze, the flashing sword! He hath learned also when it behoves him to stand and anon to charge; and he hath learned to hearken to the watchword of mighty captains. Often, too, he calmly brings nigh to the towers the warfare of men with soaring shields, when athwart the heads of men shield presses upon shield, what time they are fain to sack the city of the enemy and fashion aloft a plain with their shields of sevenfold hides, daedal and dense and many-bossed; in front the sunlight glances from the bronze and straightway behind great space of sky lightens with rays refracted. To <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> beyond all mortal creatures cunning Nature has given a subtle mind and heart.

First in his craft he covered both with alien hides, and then he anointed all their bodies with sweet-smelling oil and fragrant; for he hoped to destroy the tell-tale scent.

In the case of the Orynxes there are two species of many-patterned beauty. One species are inscribed on neck and broad hairy back with a series of long stripes, even as the swift tigers, the offspring of rapid <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>Zephyrus</a>. The others are adorned all about with densely set round spots, like those of leopards; this species while they are still but baby foals, are tattooed by skilful men, who brand their long hair with the flaming bronze. And ofttimes men have contrived other subtle devices for inscribing the foal while yet pin his mother's womb. O what a heart, what a mind have mortal men! They do as they list; they make <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> of varied colours while yet enveloped in the milky mother's loins. What time the mating impulse seizes the mare and she abides the approach of the glorious high-spirited <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, then they cunningly adorn the beautiful sire.

And the mare conceives and bears a many-patterned foal, having received in her womb the fertile seed of her spouse, but in her eyes his many-coloured form. Such devices have they also with cunning wits contrived whose business is with reed, even the fowlers, when they variegate the young of doves. For when the swift doves mate and mingle mouths with their deep-noted spouses, then the breeder of tame birds contrives a glorious device. Near the hen-birds he puts many vari-coloured purple cloths; and they, beholding them with eyes askant are gladdened in their hearts and produce sea-purple children. Nay, even so also the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconians</a> contrived a subtle device for their dear wives when they are pregnant.

How sweet the sleep upon the flowers in springtime; how sweet in summer the low couch in some cave; what delight for hunters to break their fast amid the rocks and what joy attends them when they cull for themselves the flower of honied fruit; and the cold clear water flowing from a grotto — what a draft for a weary man and how sweet a bath; and in the woods what grateful gifts in pleasant baskets are brought by shepherds watching by their flocks! </p>                        </div>

First face to face they glare at one another and greatly quiver with wildly seething wrath and breathe fiery breath and tear up the earth with their feet, even as if they were wrestlers dusting themselves for fray. They challenge from either side, loudly bellowing the cry of battle; and when they have sounded the trumpet for grievous combat, incontinently they charge and straightway with their horns each wounds in turn all the body of the other. Even as in battle upon the deep when the sea War-god raises strife, two ships, splendidly flashing with serried warriors face to face, clash with opposing prows front to front, sped by the violent wind and the hands of the sailors; and amid brazen armour rings the din of men and the noise of crashing ships, and the whole sea seethes and groans; even in such wise the din of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bulls</a> ascends to heaven, as they smite amain and are smitten with their horns, until one wins the dear and doubtful victory.

They have hidden within their loins under the very belly twin ducts. If one cut these out, straightway he makes the animal effeminate, and from its head falls away all the daedal many-branched growth of sharp horns.

Not standing in the pastoral valleys nor lying on the flowery grass upon the ground do the Stags consort with the female deer, but the hind runs and the Stag running with swift feet overtakes her and seizes the fugitive and embraces her for his bride. But not even so does he persuade her. Carrying her mate upon her back she flees with all her might, having a heart altogether implacable. But he following swiftly on two feet forgoes not his desire but accomplishes the rites of union.

For they tread the solid earth and cross the deep, voyaging together in company when they travel over the sea. One in front leads the Deer in line, even as a pilot handles the helm of a ship. Another behind rests on his back his neck and head and so travels with him in his seafaring. And so in turn, one supporting another, they plough the sea. But when weariness overtakes the foremost swimmer, he leaves his rank and goes to the end of the line and resting on another takes a little respite from his toil, while another takes the helm and journeys over the deep.

Such words thou wouldst think she spoke, while they, standing before her, first sing, thou wouldst imagine, a mournful dirge about their mother, and then, breaking forth in bleating, speak in human accents and as if they used the speech of men and like as if they prayed, utter from their lips such language as this: In the name of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> we pray thee, in the name of the Archer Maid herself, release to us our dear mother, and accept a ransom, even all that we unhappy can offer for our poor mother — even our hapless selves. Bend thy cruel heart and have regard unto the law of Heaven and to the old age of a parent, if thou hast thyself an aged parent left in thy bright home. Such prayer might one fancy that they utter. But when they see that thy heart is altogether inexorable, — how great their regard, how great their love for their parents! — they come to bondage of their own accord and of their own motion pass the bourne. </p>                        </div>

His colour is even as that of milk in spring, only the cheeks about his face being black. He has a double back, rich in fat. Sharp rise aloft the piercing points of his horns, black of hue, which are mightier than whetted bronze or chilly iron or jagged rock, and men say that those horns have a venomous nature. The spirit of the Oryx is overweening and stern. For they tremble neither at the yelping of the keen-scented Hound nor at the snorting of the wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Boar</a> among the rocks, neither do they fear the mighty bellowing of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>Bull</a> nor shudder at the mirthless cry of the Leopard nor the mighty roar of the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> himself, nor in the dauntlessness of their heart do they care aught for men: many a time a mighty hunter has perished on the hills when he has encountered the deadly Oryxes. When the Oryx descries a valiant wild beast, a tusked <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Boar</a> or a saw-toothed <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> or chilly Bear of deadly courage, straightway he bows to earth and holds steadfast his outstretched head and brows, and fixing close to the ground his sharp weapons, awaits the onset of the foe and strikes him first and slays. For bending a little aside his horned brows he watches and springs with his sharper weapons on the beast; which, heeding not, rushes incontinently straight on and horribly clashes with the sharp palisade of his horns. As when in the thickets, as a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> charges, a valiant man, who is skilled in the gifts of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, holding in his hands his flashing spear, with feet set well apart, awaits him, and, as he rages wildly, receives him with his two-edged brazen spear advanced: even so the Oryxes in that hour await the charge of the wild beasts, who are self-slain by their own folly. For the points of the horns glide easily into their breasts, and much dark blood, pouring on either side from their wounds — their own blood — they speedily lick with their tongues; nor can they escape if they would, but they slay one another with mutual slaughter. And some countryman, a herdsman or a ploughman, chancing on the two corpses at his feet, with marvelling heart wins a welcome prey. <br />Next in order among horned wild beasts it is meet to sing the tribes of the elephant infinite in size. Those two mighty weapons in their jaws, which rise like tusks towards the heavens, others of the vulgar herd call deadly teeth; wherein they err: we are pleased to name them horns; for so the nature of horns declares to us. Not obscure are the signs whereby they may be distinguished. For such growths from the upper jaws of wild beasts as are horny, spring upward: if they incline downward, they are certainly teeth. </p>                        </div>

Moreover, there is another clear sign for men. All teeth of wild beasts are unbending and do not yield to art but remain intractable, and if a worker in horn wishes by his skill to make them broad, they flatly refuse, and if they are forced, the stubborn teeth break stemwise. From horns on the other hand are fashioned bent bows and countless other works of art. In like manner those elephant horns which men call teeth, yield to the ivory-cutter to bend them or to broaden. <br />These beasts have a bulk such as on the earth no other wild beast yet hath worn. Seeing an elephant thou wouldst say that a huge mountain-peak or a dread cloud, fraught with storm for hapless mortals, was travelling on the land. The head is strong with ears small, hollow, and polished. The eyes, though large, are small for that size of beast. Between them projects a great nose, thin and crooked, which men call the proboscis. That is the hand of the beast; with it they easily do whatsoever they will. The legs are not equal in size; for the fore-legs rise to a far greater height. The hide that covers the body is rugged, impenetrable and strong, which not even a blade of mighty all-subduing iron would easily cleave. Wild without limit is the temper of the Elephant in the shady wood but among men he is tame and gentle to human kind. In the green glens of many cliffs he stretches root and branch upon the ground, oaks and wild olives and the high-crowned race of palms, assailing them with his sharp tremendous tusks; but when he is in the strong hands of men, he forgets his temper and his fierce spirit leaves him: he endures even the yoke and receives the bit in his mouth and carries upon his back the boys who order his work. </p>                        </div>

But not to all is the speech of the beasts audible, but only the men who tame them hear it. This marvel also I have heard, that the mighty elephants have a prophetic soul within their breasts and know in their hearts when their inevitable doom is at hand. Not then among birds only are there prophets, even the Swans who sing their last lament, but among wild beasts also this tribe divine the end of death and perform their own dirge. <br />The Rhinoceros is not much larger than the bounding Oryx. A little above the tip of the nose rises a horn dread and sharp, a cruel sword. Charging therewith he could pierce through bronze and with its stroke could cleave a mighty cliff. He attacks the Elephant strong though it be and many a time lays so mighty a beast dead in the dust. On his yellowish, hairy brows and on his back dense spots show darkly. All the breed are males and a female is never seen. Whence they come I know not, but I speak as I have learnt, whether this deadly race springs from rock or whether they are children of the soil and spring from the ground, or whether the wild monsters are begotten of one another, without desire and without mating and without birth. Even in the wet depths of the sea with its watery ways there are tribes which come into being self-made and motherless — Oysters and feeble Fry and the races of Sea-snails and Testacea and Spiral-shells and all that grow in the sands. </p>                        </div>

These indeed remain with eyes closed all the winter season, drunk with sleep. Hapless creatures! to take no food! not to behold the light! In their lairs, so deep asleep are they, they lie as dead and a wintry lot is theirs. But when eyes of spring first smile and the flowers in the meadow newly bloom, they stir their sluggish bodies from their secret lair and open their eyes and behold the light of the sun, and with new delight bethink them of sweet food, and once more become alive and Dormice once again. <br />I leave too the shaggy race of the feeble Squirrel, who in the fiery season of midsummer erects his tail to shelter his self-roofed dwelling; even as the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>Peacocks</a> shelter their own beautiful form, their splendid form with many-pictured back: than whom the wisdom of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> hath devised for men naught more pleasant to behold with glad eyes, neither amid all that walk mother earth, giver of all gifts, nor amid all that travel on wings the spacious air, nor amid those that in the deep cleave the wild waves: in such wise on the splendid birds twinkles blazing fire mingled with the sheen of gold.

I have seen, not merely heard of, that terrible beast, when it was transported to be a spectacle for royal eyes. <br />The tribes of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a> do not need food every day but one day they devote to feeding, the next in turn to labour. Neither doth the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> take his sleep by the inmost bounds of a rock, but he sleeps in the open, revolving a courageous soul, and wheresoever sovran night overtakes him at evening, there he sleeps. This also have I heard from the keepers of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a>, to wit that under his right paw the tawny <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> has a power of swift benumbing, wherewith he utterly benumbs the knees of wild beasts. Five times doth the Lioness loose her zone in birth, and idle truly is the report that she bears but one. Five she bears the first time, but next she travails with four cubs; then next in order from her third labour spring three; from her fourth spring twin young; and last from her womb of noble progeny the mother brings forth the glorious <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> King. </p>                        </div>

Such constraining love of child and new-born babe hath God instilled into the heart: not alone in men who devise all things by their wits but even in creeping things and fish and the ravenous wild beasts themselves and the high-ranging flocks of birds: so much is nature mightier than all beside. </p>                        </div>

Sawtoothed, deadly, and long is their mouth; nose dark, eye keen, ankle swift, body nimble, head broad, hands like the hands of men, feet like men's feet; terrible their roar, cunning their wits, fierce their heart; and they are much given to venery and that not orderly. For evermore by day and night the females lust for mating and themselves pursue the males, seldom intermitting the pleasures of union and conceiving young when already pregnant. For it is not the custom for wild beasts when they are with young to mate and fulfil the work of desire, apart only from the Lynxes and the weakling Hares. But the she Bear in her desire for mating, and abhorring to have her bed widowed, endures to devise for her children thus: ere the season of birth, ere the appointed day arrives, she puts pressure on her womb and does violence to the goddesses of birth: so great her lechery, so great her haste for love. She brings forth her children half formed and not particulate, shapeless flesh, and unjointed and mysterious to behold. At one and the same time she attends to mating and to the rearing of her young and when she has but newly given birth she couches with the male. And she licks with her tongue her dear offspring, even as <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> lick one another in turn with their tongues and take delight in each other; and one of the fair-horned <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a> rejoices in the other and they do not part till they have put from them sweet desire, and they gladden the heart of their attendant herdsman. So doth the she Bear shape her children by licking; while they whine and mumble incontinently. Moreover the Bear beyond all others dreads the onset of winter, shaggy of hair though she be. And when the snow besprinkles everything, what time the stormy <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>West Wind</a> sheds it thickly all about, she hides in a cave where there is shelter adequate and spacious, and for lack of food she licks her feet and paws even as if she were milking them and beguiles the craving of the belly. Even such a device have the coiling Poulpes devised in the depths of the wide-wayed sea amid the waves; who dreading the chilly menace of mid-winter hide in the shelving rocks and devour their own tentacles; but when spring blooms, moist and fertile, new arms speedily grow for them again and once again with fair array of suckers they sail the long path of the sea. </p>                        </div>

About the middle of his back is set a black stripe, surrounded on either side by snowy bands. He eats hay and the grass-growing earth feeds him abundantly; but he himself is good food for mighty wild beasts. The tribes of the wind-footed Wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Asses</a> are altogether prone to jealousy and they glory in many wives and plume themselves thereon. The females follow wheresoever the husband leads: they haste to the pasture when he wills to bid them, and, when he bids, to the river springs, the wild beasts' wine, and anon to their bosky homes when evening brings sleep. A fierce and shameless frenzy stirs jealousy in all the males against their own young sons. For when the female is in the travail of <a href=/people/672 target=_blank>Eileithyia</a>, the male sits hard by and watches for his own offspring. And when the infant foal falls at the feet of his mother, if it is a female, the father is fond of his child and licks it on either side with his tongue and caresses his dear offspring; but if he sees that it is a male, then, then the frenzied beast stirs his heart with deadly jealousy about the mother and he leaps forth, eager to rend with his jaws the privy parts of his child, lest afterward a new brood should grow up; while the mother, though but newly delivered and weak from the travail of birth, succours her poor child in the quarrel. As when in grievous war cruel warriors slay a child before the eyes of his mother and hale herself while she clings to her son yet writhing in his blood and wails with loud and lamentable cry and tears her tender cheek and is drenched below with the hot blood and warm milk of her breasts; even so the she Wild <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Ass</a> is just as if she were piteously lamenting and sorrowfully wailing over her son. Thou wouldst say that all unhappy, bestriding her child, she was speaking honeyed words and uttering this prayer. O husband, husband, wherefore is thy face hardened and thine eyes red that before were bright? It is not <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Medusa</a>'s brow who turned men to stone that thou beholdest near; not the venomous offspring of Dragoness implacable; not the lawless whelp of mountain-roaming Lioness. The child whom I, unhappy mother, bare, the child for whom we prayed to the gods, even thine own child, wilt thou with thine own jaws mutilate? Stay, dear, mar him not! Ah! why hast thou marred him? What a deed thou hast done! Thou hast turned the child to nothingness and has made all his body blind. Wretched and unhappy I in my untimely motherhood, and altogether wretched thou, my child, in thy most sinful father. Wretched I, thrice miserable, who have travailed in vain, and wretched thou, marred not by the claws of <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lions</a>, but by the cruel <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a> jaws of thy sire. Thus one would say the unhappy mother speaks over her infant son, while the unheeding father with bloody jaws makes mirthless banquet of his child. O father <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, how fierce a heart hath Jealousy! Him hast thou made, O lord, mightier than nature to behold and hast given him the bitter force of fire, and in his right hand hast vouchsafed to him to wear a sword of adamant. He preserves not, when he comes, dear children to their loving parents, he knows nor comrade nor kin nor cousin, when he intervenes grievous and unspeakable. </p>                        </div>

Terribly he howls and very high he leaps, ever shaking his head and glaring with fiery eyes. <br />Another again is superior in size and long of limb, swiftest in speed among all Wolves that are; him men name the Hawk and the Harrier.

As much doth the Tiger excel among wild beasts as the <a href=/people/12195 target=_blank>Peacock</a> doth for beauty among the fowls of air. Every way like a lioness of the hills wouldst thou behold it, apart only from the hide, which is variegated, with darkling stripes and brilliant sheen. Like are the eyes that lighten with fiery flash beneath the brows; like the body, strong and fleshy; like the long and bushy tail; like the face about the mouth; like the frowning brows above; like the gleaming teeth. Swifter is it than all wild beasts that are; for it runs with speed like its sire, the <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>West Wind</a> himself. Yet the <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>West Wind</a> is not its sire; who would believe that wild beasts mated with an airy bridegroom? For that also is an empty tale, that all this tribe is female and mates not with a male; for often mightst thou see its handsome spouse of many colours, but not easily couldst thou capture him; for he leaves his young and flees amain when he descries the hunters; but the female follows her cubs and in the anguish of her heart — to the great joy of the hunters — comes straight to the nets. </p>                        </div>

He loves a lair in the farthest depths of the crags and greatly he loathes the noisy din of wild beasts. Unceasingly he roams in pursuit of the female and is greatly excited by the frenzy of desire. On his neck the hair bristles erect, like the crest of a great-plumed helmet. He drops foam upon the ground and gnashes the white edge of his teeth, panting hotly; and there is much more rage about his mating than modesty. If the female abide his advances, she quenches all his rage and lulls to rest his passion. But if she refuses intercourse and flee, straightway stirred by the hot and fiery goad of desire he either overcomes her and mates with her by force or he attacks her with his jaws and lays her dead in the dust. There is a tale touching the Wild <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Boar</a> that his white tusk has within it a secret devouring fiery force. A manifest proof of this for men is well founded. For when a great thronging crowd of hunters with their <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dogs</a> lay the beast low upon the ground, overcoming him with long spear on spear, then if one take a thin hair from the neck and approach it to the tusk of the still gasping beast, straightway the hair takes fire and curls up. And on either side of the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dogs</a> themselves, where the fierce tusks of the <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>Swine</a>'s jaws have touched them, marks of burning are traced upon the hide. <br />Than the Porcupines there is nothing in the shady wood more terrible to behold nor aught more deadly. Their size is like that of the bloody Wolves; short, small, and strong is their body, but their hide bristles all about with rough and shaggy quills, such as those with which the cunning tribes of Hedgehogs are armed. But when far mightier beasts pursue him, then he uses this device. He erects his sharp quills and backward hurls straight the dire shaft that bristles on his flying back, and both flees amain and fights as he seeks to escape. Many a time he slays a saw-toothed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dog</a>; even so, one would say, shoots a man well skilled in archery. Therefore when the hunters espy him, they do not slip the <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dogs</a> but devise a trick, which I shall tell when I sing of the slaying of wild beasts. </p>                        </div>

For indeed by its craft it slays two tribes — the reptile Serpents and the terrible Crocodiles, those creatures of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil class=place long=31.2313 lat=30.0918>Nile</a>, a deadly race. When one of the dread beasts sleeps, opening his lips with triple row and phis wide gape and his fence unspeakable of flashing teeth, then the Ichneumon weaves a subtle device. With eyes askance he watches the huge beast until he is fit in his heart that it is deep asleep. Then, having rolled himself in sand and mud he swiftly springs and flies with daring heart through the gate of death and passes through wide throat. Then the wretched Crocodile wakes from his heavy sleep and carrying in his belly such an evil unlooked for, everywhere he roams in helpless rage, now going to the farthest reaches of the river, now rolling shoreward in the sand, gasping wildly and tossing in his agony. But the Ichneumon heeds not but enjoys his sweet repast; and mostly by the liver he sits to banquet; then late and last he leaps forth and leaves the empty body of the beast. O Ichneumon, marvellous and mighty, cunning in counsel, how great daring thy heart holds! What a task thou dost undertake, advancing thy body to the very jaws of death. <br />The venomous Asp the Ichneumon overcomes by this device. He lies in wait for the beast, hiding all his body in the sands, save only the tail and the fiery eyes; for the tail is long and snakelike with curling headlike tufts, black to the view, like the scales of <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>. When he seeks the dusky puffing <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>viper</a>, he arches his tail in front of her and challenges the deadly beast. The Asp over against him lifts up her head hard by and expands her breast and bares her stubborn teeth and fights vainly with her deadly jaws. But then the warlike Ichneumon lingers not in the sands, but leaps and seizes her terrible throat and rends her with his jaws as she twists this way and that and straightway lays her dead — vainly spitting forth bitter deadly venom of her passionate wrath. </p>                        </div>

Terrible is she to fight with her teeth against stronger wild beasts and hunting <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>Dogs</a>. And when chilly winter comes and she lacks food, and the vines show bare of grapes, then she weaves a deadly device for hunting, to capture by craft birds and the young of Hares. <br />Tell also, I pray thee, O clear-voiced <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muse</a> of diverse tones, of those tribes of wild beasts which are of hybrid nature and mingled of two stocks, even the Pard of spotted back joined and united with the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camel</a>. O Father <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, how many things hast thou devised, how many forms hast thou created for us, how many hast thou given to men, how many to the finny creatures of the sea! Even as thou hast devised this very varied form of the <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camel</a>, clothing with the hide of the shameless Pard a race splendid and lovely and gentle to men. Long is its neck, its body spotted, the ears small, bare the head above, long the legs, the soles of the feet broad; the limbs are unequal and the legs are not altogether alike, but the fore-legs are greater while the hind-legs are much smaller and look as if they were squatting on their haunches. From the middle of the head two horns rise straight up — not horny horns, but feeble projections on the head which alongside the ears rise up between the temples. The tender mouth is sufficiently large, like that of a Stag and within are set on either side thin milk-white teeth. A bright gleam lightens from the eyes. The tail, again, is short, like that of the swift Gazelles, with dark hair at the hinder end. <br />Yea and another double breed have I beheld with mine eyes, a mighty marvel, <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camel</a> united with Sparrow; which, though it is numbered with the lightsome birds and is winged, notwithstanding my lays shall celebrate, since the varied range of our hunting admits it. For the lime that is the enemy of birds does not prevail over it, nor the reeds that tread an airy path, but <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>Horses</a> and swift Hounds and unseen snares. Its size is huge, so that it can carry on its broad back a young boy. The legs are long, like to those of the sluggish <a href=/people/10950 target=_blank>Camels</a>, and are arrayed as it were with close-set hard scales up to the double thigh. Small is the head that it rears on high but long the hairy dusky neck. They have abundant feathers; yet they do not sail aloft on the high paths of air, but notwithstanding, as they run swiftly with their feet, they have a speed equal to the birds themselves. Nor do they mate like birds by mounting but, like the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/340670RBac class=demonym long=66.901 lat=36.768>Bactrian</a> tribe, rear to rear.

Brightly flash their goodly orbs, their eyes armed with sleeplessness; for never do they slumber and admit sleep upon their eyelids, being afraid of the violence of wild beasts and the nimble wit of men, but they are wakeful in the night and indulge their desire. Unceasingly they yearn to mate and while the females are still pregnant they do not reject the lustful advances of the male, not even when they carry in the womb the swift arrow of fruitfulness. For this tribe, among all that the infinite earth breeds, is the most prolific. The one embryo comes forth from the mother's womb full-formed, while she carries one within her still hairless, and nourishes another half-formed, and has in her womb yet another — a formless foetus to look on.

Now let us sing the great business of the toilsome hunters, both their valiant might and their prudent counsel, their cunning craft and their heart armed with manifold wiles; for verily that heart wars against wild races to whom God hath given strength and goodly courage and wits not far inferior to the hunters themselves. <br />Many are the modes of glorious and profitable hunting: modes innumerable, suited to the various beasts and tribes and glens. Who with his single mind should comprehend them all and tell of them in order with euphonious song? Who could behold them all? Who could behold so much, being mortal? Only the Gods easily see all things.

Wherefore the riders who are mounted on those <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> leave their beloved <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> at home and ride forth trusting to their <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> and the rays of the sun, without other helpers. Common, too, is hurling the javelin and shooting with the bow at the mightier wild beasts which fight amain with men. <br />With reference to the net one must steer the course of the hunt and avoid the breath of the breeze and watch the wind. And even as men who ride in seafaring ships sit in the stern with the tiller in their hands and scan the sky and obedient to the white <a href=/people/1011 target=_blank>South Wind</a> spread the sails of their ships of canvas wings, so on the dry land I bid the hunter scan on either hand the winds that blow, that so they may set up their nets and drive the game ever against the wind; since all wild beasts have keenest sense of smell, and if they perceive the scent either of the net-stakes or the spread net, they rush the other way and flee incontinently even in the very face of the men and make vain the labour of the hunt. Therefore I would have the slayers of wild beasts scan rushing winds and face the course of the wind when you attend to their stakes and the setting of nets; let them make back to the South when the clear <a href=/people/208 target=_blank>North Wind</a> rises; to the North if the dewy <a href=/people/1011 target=_blank>South Wind</a> rages; when the <a href=/people/2311 target=_blank>East Wind</a> gets up, let them run with the breezes of the West; when <a href=/people/444 target=_blank>West Wind</a> stirs, let them speedily make for the East. </p>                        </div>

Next they observe the great path with the worn tracks of the wild beast, whereby he often goes to the river to drink a sweet draught. There they dig a round pit, wide and large; and in the midst of the trench they build a great pillar, sheer and high. From this they hang aloft a suckling <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> taken from its mother that hath newly yeaned. And outside the pit they wreath a wall around, built with close-set boulders, that the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a> may not see the crafty chasm when he draws near. And the high-hung suckling <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>lamb</a> bleats, and the sound strikes the <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>Lion</a>'s hungry heart, hasting in the track of the cry and scanning this side and that with fiery eyes. And anon he comes nigh the snare, and he wheels about and a great hunger urges him, and straightway obeying the impulse of hunger he leaps over the wall, and the wide round chasm receives him, and he comes unwittingly to the gulf of a pit unlooked for. Everywhere he circles about, rushing ever backwards and forwards, even as a swift race-horse round the turning-post, constrained by the hands of his charioteer and by the bridle. And from their far-seen place of outlook the hunters see him and rush up, and with well-cut straps they bind and let down a plaited well-compacted cage, in which also they put a piece of roasted meat.

Now when all things are ready, the trumpet sounds its tremendous note, and the Bear leaps forth from the thicket with a sharp cry and looks sharply as she cries. And the young men rush on in a body and from either side come in battalions against the beast and drive her before them. And she, leaving the din and the men, rushes straight where she sees an empty space of open plain. Thereupon in turn an ambush of men arises in her rear and make a clattering din, driving her to the brow of the rope and the many-coloured scare. And the wretched beast is utterly in doubt and flees distraught, fearful of all alike — the ambush of men, the din, the flute, the shouting, the scaring rope; for with the roaring wind the ribands wave aloft in the air and the swinging feathers whistle shrill. So, glancing about her, the Bear draws nigh net and falls into the flaxen ambush. Then the watchers at the ends of the net near at hand spring forth and speedily draw tight above the skirting cord of broom. Net on net they pile; for at that moment Bears greatly rage with jaws and terrible paws, and many a time they straightway evade the hunters and escape from nets and make the hunting vain. But at that same moment some strong man fetters the right paw of the Bear and widows her of all her force, and binds her skilfully and ties the beast to planks of wood and encloses her again in a cage of oak and pine, after she has exercised her body in many a twist and turn. </p>                        </div>

For the moment that they see <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> and huntsmen they rush uphill; since they well know that their forelegs are shorter. Hence hills are easy for Hares — easy for Hares but difficult for mounted men. Moreover, the hunter should avoid much-trodden ways and the beaten track and pursue them in the tilled fields. For on the trodden way they are nimbler and light of foot and easily rush on. But on the ploughed land their feet are heavy in summer and in the winter season they carry a fatal shoe that reaches to the ankle. <br />If ever thou art hunting a Gazelle, beware that after a very long and extended course and term of toil it do not halt a moment and relieve nature. For in Gazelles beyond all others the bladder swells in the midst of their course and their flanks are burdened by involuntary warm waters and they squat upon their haunches. But if they take breath a little with their noisy throats, they flee far more strongly and more swiftly with nimble knees and lighter loins. <br />The Fox is not to be captured by ambush nor by noose nor by net. For she is clever in her cunning at perceiving them; clever too at severing a rope and loosing knots and by subtle craft escaping from death. But the thronging <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a> take her; yet even they for all their strength do and overcome her without bloodshed. </p>                        </div>
