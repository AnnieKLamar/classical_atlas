Well, only the other day, as I looked at him, I thought him still handsome as a man—for a man he is, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, between you and me, and with quite a growth of beard. <br />SOCRATES: And what of that? Do you mean to say you do not approve of <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a>, [309b] who said that youth has highest grace in him whose beard is appearing, as now in the case of <a href=/people/52 target=_blank>Alcibiades</a>? <br />FRIEND: Then how is the affair at present? Have you been with him just now? And how is the young man treating you? <br />SOCRATES: Quite well, I considered, and especially so today: for he spoke a good deal on my side, supporting me in a discussion—in fact I have only just left him. However, there is a strange thing I have to tell you: although he was present, I not merely paid him no attention, but at times forgot him altogether.</p>                        </div>

During this night just past, in the small hours, <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a>, son of <a href=/people/110 target=_blank>Apollodorus</a> and brother of Phason, knocked violently at my door with his stick, [310b] and when they opened to him he came hurrying in at once and calling to me in a loud voice: <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, are you awake, or sleeping? Then I, recognizing his voice, said: <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a>, hallo! Some news to break to me? Only good news, he replied. Tell it, and welcome, I said: what is it, and what business brings you here at such an hour? <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> has come, he said, standing at my side.

My boy <a href=/people/397 target=_blank>Satyrus</a>, you see, had run away: I meant to let you know I was going in chase of him, but some other matter put it out of my head. On my return, when we had finished dinner and were about to retire, my brother told me, only then, that <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> had come. I made an effort, even at that hour, to get to you at once, but came to the conclusion that it was too late at night. [310d] But as soon as I had slept off my fatigue I got up at once and made my way straight here. Then I, noting the man's gallant spirit and the flutter he was in, remarked: Well, what is that to you? Has <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> wronged you? At this he laughed and, Yes, by the gods! he said, by being the only wise man, and not making me one. But, by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>! I said, if you give him a fee and win him over he will make you wise too. Would to <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and all the gods, he exclaimed, [310e] only that were needed! I should not spare either my own pocket or those of my friends. But it is on this very account I have come to you now, to see if you will have a talk with him on my behalf: for one thing, I am too young to do it myself; and for another, I have never yet seen <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> nor heard him speak a word—I was but a child when he paid us his previous visit.

[313d] For among the provisions, you know, in which these men deal, not only are they themselves ignorant what is good or bad for the body, since in selling they commend them all, but the people who buy from them are so too, unless one happens to be a trainer or a doctor. And in the same way, those who take their doctrines the round of our cities, hawking them about to any odd purchaser who desires them, commend everything that they sell, and there may well be some of these too, my good sir, who are ignorant which of their wares is [313e] good or bad for the soul; and in just the same case are the people who buy from them, unless one happens to have a doctor's knowledge here also, but of the soul.

When you buy victuals and liquors you can carry them off from the dealer or merchant in separate vessels, and before you take them into your body by drinking or eating you can lay them in your house and take the advice of an expert whom you can call in, as to what is fit to eat or drink and what is not, and how much you should take and when; so that in this purchase the risk is not serious. [314b] But you cannot carry away doctrines in a separate vessel: you are compelled, when you have handed over the price, to take the doctrine in your very soul by learning it, and so to depart either an injured or a benefited man.

Now, I fancy the doorkeeper, who was a eunuch, overheard us; very likely [314d] the great number of sophists has made him annoyed with callers at the house: at any rate, when we had knocked on the door, he opened it and, on seeing us,—Hullo, he said, sophists there!

Am I to place among men right and respect in this way also, or deal them out to all?” [322d] “To all,” replied <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>; “let all have their share: for cities cannot be formed if only a few have a share of these as of other arts. And make thereto a law of my ordaining, that he who cannot partake of respect and right shall die the death as a public pest.” Hence it comes about, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, that people in cities, and especially in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, consider it the concern of a few to advise on cases of artistic excellence or good craftsmanship, [322e] and if anyone outside the few gives advice they disallow it, as you say, and not without reason, as I think: but when they meet for a consultation on civic art,</p>                        </div>

[323d] In all cases of evils which men deem to have befallen their neighbors by nature or fortune, nobody is wroth with them or reproves or lectures or punishes them, when so afflicted, with a view to their being other than they are; one merely pities them. Who, for instance, is such a fool as to try to do anything of the sort to the ugly, the puny, or the weak? Because, I presume, men know that it is by nature and fortune that people get these things, the <a href=/people/5553 target=_blank>Graces</a> of life and their opposites. But as to all the good things that people are supposed to get by application and practice and teaching, [323e] where these are lacking in anyone and only their opposite evils are found, here surely are the occasions for wrath and punishment and reproof.

No one punishes a wrong-doer from the mere contemplation [324b] or on account of his wrong-doing, unless one takes unreasoning vengeance like a wild beast. But he who undertakes to punish with reason does not avenge himself for the past offence, since he cannot make what was done as though it had not come to pass; he looks rather to the future, and aims at preventing that particular person and others who see him punished from doing wrong again.

If he readily obeys,—so; but if not, they treat him as a bent and twisted piece of wood and straighten him with threats and blows. After this they send them to school and charge the master to take far more pains over their children's good behavior than over their letters [325e] and harp-playing. The masters take pains accordingly, and the children, when they have learnt their letters and are getting to understand the written word as before they did only the spoken, are furnished with works of good poets to read as they sit in class, and are made to learn them off by heart:</p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> here, while able to deliver, as events have shown, a long and excellent speech, is also able when questioned to reply briefly, and after asking a question to await and accept the answer—accomplishments that few can claim.

You said that <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> had sent justice and respect to mankind, and furthermore it was frequently stated in your discourse that justice, temperance, holiness and the rest were all but one single thing, virtue: pray, now proceed to deal with these in more precise exposition, stating whether virtue is a single thing, of which justice and temperance and holiness are parts, [329d] or whether the qualities I have just mentioned are all names of the same single thing. This is what I am still hankering after. <br />Why, the answer to that is easy, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, he replied: it is that virtue is a single thing and the qualities in question are parts of it. <br />Do you mean parts, I asked, in the sense of the parts of a face, as mouth, nose, eyes, and ears; or, as in the parts of gold, is there no difference among the pieces, either between the parts or between a part and the whole, except in greatness and smallness? <br />In the former sense, I think, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>; as the parts of the face [329e] are to the whole face. <br />Well then, I continued, when men partake of these portions of virtue, do some have one, and some another, or if you get one, must you have them all? <br />By no means, he replied, since many are brave but unjust, and many again are just but not wise. <br />Then are these also parts of virtue,</p>                        </div>

Just as, in the parts of the face, the eye is not like the ears, nor is its function the same; nor is any of the other parts like another, in its function or in any other respect: in the same way, are the parts of virtue unlike each other, [330b] both in themselves and in their functions? Are they not evidently so, if the analogy holds? <br />Yes, they are so, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, he said. <br />So then, I went on, among the parts of virtue, no other part is like knowledge, or like justice, or like courage, or like temperance, or like holiness. <br />He agreed. <br />Come now, I said, let us consider together what sort of thing is each of these parts.

We should say we do, I fancy. <br />Yes, he said. <br />Then do you call this a thing also?

And you—would you not make the same reply? <br />Certainly I would, he said. <br />Now suppose he went on to ask us: Well, and what of your statement a little while since? Perhaps I did not hear you aright, but I understood you two to say that the parts of virtue are in such a relation to each other that one of them is not like another.

Can holiness be not just, and therefore unjust, and justice unholy? [331b] What is to be our reply? I should say myself, on my own behalf, that both justice is holy and holiness just, and with your permission I would make this same reply for you also; since justness is either the same thing as holiness or extremely like it, and above all, justice is of the same kind as holiness, and holiness as justice.

Thus there is a point in which white resembles black, and hard soft, and so with all the other things which are regarded as most opposed to each other; and the things which we spoke of before as having different faculties and not being of the same kind as each other—the parts of the face—these in some sense resemble one another and are of like sort. In this way therefore you could prove, if you chose, [331e] that even these things are all like one another. But it is not fair to describe things as like which have some point alike, however small, or ash unlike that have some point unlike. <br />This surprised me, and I said to him: What, do you regard just and holy as so related to each other that they have only some small point of likeness? <br />Not so, he replied, at all, nor yet,</p>                        </div>

Why, I asked, does it not seem so to you? [339d] How can anyone, he replied, be thought consistent, who says both of these things?

For what <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> said was not, as <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> said, that it is hard “to become” but “to be” good. Now being and becoming, <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, as our friend <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> says, are not the same thing; and if being and becoming are not the same thing, <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> does not contradict himself. Perhaps <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> [340d] and many others might say with <a href=/people/86 target=_blank>Hesiod</a> that to become good is hard, ““for <a href=/people/459 target=_blank>Heaven</a> hath set hard travail on the way to virtue; and when one reacheth the summit thereof, 'tis an easy thing to possess, though hard before.””Hes. WD 289 <br />When <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> heard this he gave me his approval: but <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> observed: Your correction, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, contains an error greater than that which you are correcting. <br />To which I answered: then it is a bad piece of work I have done, it would seem, <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, and I am an absurd sort of physician; [340e] my treatment increases the malady. <br />Just so, he said. <br />How is that? I asked. <br />Great, he replied, would be the ignorance of the poet, if he calls it such a slight matter to possess virtue, which is the hardest thing in the world, as all men agree. <br />Then I remarked: Upon my word, how opportunely it has happened that <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> is here to join in our discussion!

Accordingly it was against this saying, and with this aim, that he composed the whole poem as a means of covertly assailing and abasing this maxim, as it seems to me. <br />Now let us all combine in considering whether my account is really true. The opening of the ode must at once appear crazy if, while intending to say that [343d] it is hard for a man to become good, he inserted “indeed.” There is no sort of sense, I imagine, in this insertion, unless we suppose that <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> is addressing himself to the saying of <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> as a disputant: <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> says—It is hard to be good; and the poet controverts this by observing—No, but to become good, indeed, is hard for a man, <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a>, truly—not truly good; he does not mention truth in this connexion, [343e] or imply that some things are truly good, while others are good but not truly so: this would seem silly and unlike <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>. We must rather take the “truly” as a poetical transposition, and first quote the saying of <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> in some such way as this: let us suppose <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> himself to be speaking and <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> replying, as thus—Good people, he says, it is hard to be good; and the poet answers—<a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a>,</p>                        </div>

There are many points in the various expressions of the poem [344b] which might be instanced to show its fine composition, for it is a work of very elegant and elaborate art; but it would take too long to detail all its beauties. However, let us go over its general outline and intention, which is assuredly to refute <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a>' saying, throughout the ode. <br />Proceeding a little way on from our passage, just as though he were making a speech, he says to become, indeed, a good man is truly hard (not but what it is possible for a certain space of time); “but to continue in this state of what one has become,</p>                        </div>

A great storm breaking over a steersman will render him helpless, and a severe season will leave a farmer helpless, and a doctor will be in the same case. For the good has the capacity of becoming bad, as we have witness in another poet who said — “Nay more, the virtuous man is at one time bad, at another good.” whereas the bad man has no capacity for becoming, but must ever be, what he is; [344e] so that when an irresistible mischance overthrows him who is resourceful, wise, and good, he cannot but be bad; and you say, <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a>, that it is hard to be good—that is, to become good, indeed, is hard, though possible, but to be good is impossible: for— <br />“If he hath fared well, every man is good;<br />Bad, if ill.” <br />Now what is good faring in letters—the thing that makes a man good at them?</p>                        </div>

But the bad man can never become bad: he is that always. If he is to become bad, he must previously become good. Hence the upshot of this part of the poem</p>                        </div>

And then—““Best also for the longest space are they whom the gods love.” <br />All this has been said with reference to <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a>, as is made still plainer by the ensuing verses, in which he says—“Therefore never shall I, in quest of what cannot come to pass, vainly cast my life's lot upon a hope impracticable—of finding a man wholly blameless amongst us who partake of the fruit of the broad-based earth. If I light upon him, be sure I will report it — says he; [345d] and in this vehement tone he pursues the saying of <a href=/people/616 target=_blank>Pittacus</a> all through the poem: <br />“But I praise and love everyone willingly committing no baseness; for against necessity not even the gods make war.” This also is spoken with the same intent.

I am fairly sure of this—that none of the wise men considers that anybody ever willingly errs [345e] or willingly does base and evil deeds; they are well aware that all who do base and evil things do them unwillingly; and so <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a> does not say he gives his praise to the person who willingly does no evil, but uses the word “willingly” of himself.

For it seems to me that arguing about poetry is comparable to the wine-parties of common market-folk. These people, owing to their inability to carry on a familiar conversation over their wine by means of their own voices and discussions— [347d] such is their lack of education—put a premium on flute-girls by hiring the extraneous voice of the flute at a high price, and carry on their intercourse by means of its utterance. But where the party consists of thorough gentlemen who have had a proper education, you will see neither flute-girls nor dancing-girls nor harp-girls, but only the company contenting themselves with their own conversation, and none of these fooleries and frolics—each speaking and listening decently in his turn, [347e] even though they may drink a great deal of wine. And so a gathering like this of ours, when it includes such men as most of us claim to be, requires no extraneous voices, not even of the poets, whom one cannot question on the sense of what they say; when they are adduced in discussion we are generally told by some that the poet thought so and so, and by others, something different, and they go on arguing about a matter which they are powerless to determine.

So if you wish to question me further, I am at your service as answerer; but if you like, put yourself at my service, so that we may clear up the several points of the inquiry in which we stopped half-way.

For I hold that there is a good deal in what <a href=/people/9 target=_blank>Homer</a> says— [348d] “When two go together, one observes before the other;” <br />for somehow it makes all of us human beings more resourceful in every deed or word or thought; but if one observes something alone, forthwith one has to go about searching until one discovers somebody to whom one can show it off and who can corroborate it. And I also have my reason for being glad to debate with you rather than with anyone else; it is that I regard you as the best person to investigate in general any matters [348e] that a sensible man may be expected to examine, and virtue in particular.

Not only do you consider yourself a worthy gentleman, like sundry other people, who are sensible enough themselves, but cannot make others so; but you are both good yourself and have the gift of making others good.

So now with regard to those points which I have raised on the subject in my opening questions, I desire to be reminded of some [349b] by you and to have your help in investigating others.

Next you show that such persons individually are bolder when they have knowledge, and bolder than others who lack it, and therewith you take courage and wisdom to be the same: proceeding in this manner you might even take strength to be wisdom. On this method you might begin by asking me whether the strong are powerful, and I should say “Yes”; [350e] and then, whether those who know how to wrestle are more powerful than those who do not know how to wrestle, and whether individually they are more powerful when they have learnt than before learning, and I should say “Yes.” And on my admitting these points it would be open to you to say, by the same token, that according to my admission wisdom is strength.

Now if our questioner chance to be an arrogant person he will laugh and exclaim: What a ridiculous statement, [355d] that a man does evil, knowing it to be evil, and not having to do it, because he is overcome by the good! Is this, he will ask, because the good is not worthy of conquering the evil in you, or because it is worthy? <br />Clearly we must reply: Because it is not worthy; otherwise he whom we speak of as overcome by pleasures would not have offended. But in what sense, he might ask us, is the good unworthy of the bad, or the bad of the good? This can only be when the one is greater and the other smaller, or when there are more on the one side and fewer on the other. We shall not find [355e] any other reason to give; So it is clear, he will say, that by “being overcome” you mean getting the greater evil in exchange for the lesser good. That must be agreed.

You asked it, if you remember, when we were agreeing that there is nothing stronger than knowledge, and that knowledge, wherever it may be found, has always the upper hand of pleasure or anything else; and then you said that pleasure often masters even the man of knowledge, and on our refusing to agree with you, you went on to ask us: <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> and <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, if this experience is not “being overcome by pleasure,” [357d] whatever can it be, and what do you call it? Tell us. If on the spur of the moment we had replied, “Ignorance,” you would have laughed us to scorn: but now if you laugh at us you will be laughing at yourselves as well. For you have admitted that it is from defect of knowledge that men err, when they do err, in their choice of pleasures and pains—that is, in the choice of good and evil; and from defect not merely of knowledge but of the knowledge which you have now admitted also to be that of measurement. And surely you know well enough for yourselves [357e] that the erring act committed without knowledge is done through ignorance. Accordingly “to be overcome by pleasure” means just this—ignorance in the highest degree, which <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> here and <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> and <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> profess to cure. But you, through supposing it to be something else than ignorance, will neither go yourselves nor send your children to these sophists, who are the teachers of those things—you say it cannot be taught; you are chary of your money and will give them none,</p>                        </div>

And I ask you now, <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> and <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, as well as <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>—for I would have you make a joint reply—whether you think what I say is true or false. <br />They all thought what I had said was absolutely true. <br />Then you agree, I continued, that the pleasant is good and the painful bad. And let me entreat my friend <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> to spare me his distinction of terms: [358b] for whether you say pleasant or delightful or enjoyable, my excellent <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, or in whatever style or manner you may be pleased to name these things, pray reply to the sense of my question. <br />At this <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> laughed and consented, as did the rest. <br />Well now, my friends, I said, what of this? All actions aimed at living painlessly and pleasantly are honorable, are they not?

And is it—I address myself to you, <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> —the same as I have in mind—something I describe as an expectation of evil, whether you call it fear or dread? <br /><a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a> and <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> agreed [358e] to this description of dread or fear; but <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a> thought this was dread, not fear. <br />No matter, <a href=/people/924 target=_blank>Prodicus</a>, I said, but my point is this: if our former statements are true, will any man wish to go after what he dreads, when he may pursue what he does not? Surely this is impossible after what we have admitted—that he regards as evil that which he dreads? And what is regarded as evil is neither pursued nor accepted willingly, we saw, by anyone.</p>                        </div>

His answer caused me great surprise at the moment, and still more when I went into the matter with your help. But anyhow, I asked him whether by the brave he meant “bold.” Yes, he replied, and impetuous.</p>                        </div>

Towards the same things as cowards? <br />No, he said. <br />Then towards other things? <br />Yes, he said. <br />Do cowards go after things that allow boldness, and the courageous after dreadful things? <br />So people say, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. <br />Quite true, I said. But my point is rather, [359d] towards what, according to you, are the brave impetuous? Dreadful things, in the belief that they are dreadful, or towards what is not dreadful? <br />No, he said; the former has just been shown, by the arguments you put forward, to be impossible. <br />Quite true again, I said; so that if this proof was correct, no one goes to meet what he regards as dreadful, since to be overcome by oneself was found to be ignorance. <br />He admitted this. <br />And yet all men go also to meet what they can face boldly, whether cowardly or brave, and in this respect cowardly and brave [359e] go to meet the same things. <br />But still, <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>, he said, what cowards go to meet is the very opposite of what the courageous go to meet. For instance, the latter are willing to go to war, but the former are not. <br />Is going to war an honorable thing, I asked, or a base thing? <br />Honorable, he replied. <br />Then if it is honorable, we have admitted, by our former argument, that it is also good for we agreed that all honorable actions were good. <br />True, and I abide by that decision. <br />You are right to do so, I said.</p>                        </div>

Does he not go to the more honorable and better and pleasanter? [360b] I am forced to admit that, he said. <br />Now, in general, courageous men do not feel base fears, when they fear, nor is there anything base in their boldness? <br />True, he said. <br />And if not base, then it must be honorable? <br />He admitted this. <br />And if honorable, then good? <br />Yes. <br />And the cowardly and the bold and the mad, on the contrary, feel base fears and base boldness? <br />He agreed. <br />Do they feel base and evil boldness solely through stupidity and ignorance?</p>                        </div>

Then I proceeded: Why is it, <a href=/people/593 target=_blank>Protagoras</a>, that you neither affirm nor deny what I ask you? <br />Finish it, he said, by yourself.
