For the men had rejected their lawful wives, loathing them, and had conceived a fierce passion for captive maids whom they themselves brought across the sea from their forays in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>; for the terrible wrath of <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a> came upon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the honours due. O hapless women, and insatiate in jealousy to their own ruin! Not their husbands alone with the captives did they slay on account of the marriage-bed, but all the males at the same time, that they might thereafter pay no retribution for the grim murder. And of all the women, <a href=/people/939 target=_blank>Hypsipyle</a> alone spared her aged father <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>, who was king over the people; and she sent him in a hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should escape. And fishermen dragged him to shore at the island of Oinoe, formerly Oinoe, but afterwards called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/367251PSik class=place long=25.0901 lat=36.662>Sicinus</a> from Sicinus, whom the water-nymph Oinoe bore to <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>. Now for all the women to tend <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>, to don armour of bronze, and to cleave with the plough-share the wheat-bearing fields, was easier than the works of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, with which they were busied aforetime. Yet for all that did they often gaze over the broad sea, in grievous fear against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a>' coming. So when they saw <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> being rowed near the island, straightway crowding in multitude from the gates of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/399251PMyr class=place long=25.0568 lat=39.877>Myrine</a> and clad in their harness of war, they poured forth to the beach like ravening <a href=/people/6995 target=_blank>Thyiades</a>: for they deemed that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> were come; and with them <a href=/people/939 target=_blank>Hypsipyle</a>, daughter of <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>, donned her father's harness.

And when they had passed within the gates and the city, the women of the people surged behind them, delighting in the stranger, but he with his eyes fixed on the ground fared straight on, till he reached the glorious palace of <a href=/people/939 target=_blank>Hypsipyle</a>; and when he appeared the maids opened the folding doors, fitted with well-fashioned panels.

And I will tell out truly all our evil plight, that ye yourselves too may know it well. When my father <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a> reigned over the citizens, then our folk starting from their homes used to plunder from their ships the dwellings of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=ethnic long=26.5 lat=41>Thracians</a> who live opposite, and they brought back hither measureless booty and maidens too. But the counsel of the baneful goddess <a href=/people/168 target=_blank>Cypris</a> was working out its accomplishment, who brought upon them soul destroying infatuation. For they hated their lawful wives, and, yielding to their own mad folly, drove them from their homes; and they took to their beds the captives of their spear, cruel ones. Long in truth we endured it, if haply again, though late, they might change their purpose, but ever the bitter woe grew, twofold. And the lawful children were being dishonoured in their halls, and a bastard race was rising. And thus unmarried maidens and widowed mothers too wandered uncared for through the city; no father heeded his daughter ever so little even though he should see her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent step-dame, nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against unseemly outrage; nor did brothers care at heart for their sister. But in their homes, in the dance, in the assembly and the banquet all their thought was only for their captive maidens; until some god put desperate courage in our hearts no more to receive our lords on their return from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a> within our towers so that they might either heed the right or might depart and begone elsewhither, they and their captives. So they begged of us all the male children that were left in the city and went back to where even now they dwell on the snowy tilths of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr class=place long=26.5 lat=41>Thrace</a>. Do ye therefore stay and settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to dwell here, and this finds favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father <a href=/people/533 target=_blank>Thoas</a>; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all; for it is deepsoiled beyond all other islands that lie in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381253WAeg class=place long=25.3 lat=38.1>Aegean sea</a>.

And they stepped ashore that same night; and the rock is still called the Sacred Rock round which they threw the ship's hawsers in their haste. Nor did anyone note with care that it was the same island; nor in the night did the Doliones clearly perceive that the heroes were returning; but they deemed that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=demonym long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgian</a> war-men of the Macrians had landed.

But <a href=/people/467 target=_blank>Aeson</a>'s son leapt upon him as he turned to face him, and smote him in the middle of the breast, and the bone was shattered round the spear; he rolled forward in the sand and filled up the measure of his fate. For that no mortal may escape; but on every side a wide snare encompasses us. And so, when he thought that he had escaped bitter death from the chiefs, fate entangled him that very night in her toils while battling with them; and many champions withal were slain; <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Heracles</a> killed <a href=/people/3086 target=_blank>Telecles</a> and Megabrontes, and <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> slew Sphodris; and <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a> slew <a href=/people/1036 target=_blank>Zelus</a> and Gephyrus swift in war. <a href=/people/258 target=_blank>Telamon</a> of the strong spear slew <a href=/people/3145 target=_blank>Basileus</a>.

And the rest gave way and fled in terror just as doves fly in terror before swift-winged hawks. And with a din they rustled in a body to the gates; and quickly the city was filled with loud cries at the turning of the dolorous fight. But at dawn both sides perceived the fatal and cureless error; and bitter grief seized the <a href=/people/11039 target=_blank>Minyan</a> heroes when they saw before them son of Aeneus fallen in the midst of dust and blood. And for three whole days they lamented and rent their hair, they and the Dollones.

Her death even the nymphs of the grove bewailed; and of all the tears for her that they shed to earth from their eyes the goddesses made a fountain, which they call <a href=/people/5562 target=_blank>Cleite</a>, the illustrious name of the hapless maid.

But the hero, ever unwounded, by his skill baffled the rush of his foe, and he quickly noted the brutal play of his fists to see where he was invincible in strength, and where inferior, and stood unceasingly and returned blow for blow. And as when shipwrights with their hammers smite ships' timbers to meet the sharp clamps, fixing layer upon layer; and the blows resound one after another; so cheeks and jaws crashed on both sides, and a huge clattering of teeth arose, nor did they cease ever from striking their blows until laboured gasping overcame both. And standing a little apart they wiped from their foreheads sweat in abundance, wearily panting for breath.

And as shepherds or beekeepers smoke out a huge swarm of <a href=/people/10964 target=_blank>bees</a> in a rock, and they meanwhile, pent up in their hive, murmur with droning hum, till, stupefied by the murky smoke, they fly forth far from the rock; so they stayed steadfast no longer, but scattered themselves inland through <a href=/people/8978 target=_blank>Bebrycia</a>, proclaiming the death of <a href=/people/1606 target=_blank>Amycus</a>; fools, not to perceive that another woe all unforeseen was hard upon them.

Assuredly, if he had been here, no trial would there have been of fists, I ween, but when the king drew near to proclaim his rules, the club would have made him forget his pride and the rules to boot.

Wherefore <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> sent upon him a lingering old age, and took from his eyes the pleasant light, and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties untold that the dwellers around ever brought to his house, when they came to enquire the will of heaven. But on a sudden, swooping through the clouds, the <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a> with their crooked beaks incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands. And at times not a morsel of food was left, at others but a little, in order that he might live and be tormented. And they poured forth over all a loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to carry food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so foully reeked the remnants of the meal.

And he rose from his couch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff, and crept to the door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he moved, his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched skin was caked with dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones together. And he came forth from the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold of the courtyard; and a dark stupor covered him, and it seemed that the earth reeled round beneath his feet, and he lay in a strengthless trance, speechless. But when they saw him they gathered round and marvelled. And he at last drew laboured breath from the depths of his chest and spoke among them with prophetic utterance: Listen, bravest of all the Hellenes, if it be truly ye, whom by a king's ruthless command <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> is leading on the ship <a href=/people/352 target=_blank>Argo</a> in quest of the fleece. It is ye truly. Even yet my soul by its divination knows everything. Thanks I render to thee, O king, son of <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Leto</a>, plunged in bitter affliction though I be. I beseech you by <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> the god of suppliants, the sternest foe to sinful men, and for the sake of <a href=/people/11033 target=_blank>Phoebus</a> and <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> herself, under whose especial care ye have come hither, help me, save an ill-fated man from misery, and depart not uncaring and leaving me thus as ye see. For not only has the Fury set her foot on my eyes and I drag on to the end a weary old age; but besides my other woes a woe hangs over me the bitterest of all. The <a href=/people/1202 target=_blank>Harpies</a>, swooping down from some unseen den of destruction, ever snatch the food from my mouth. And I have no device to aid me. But it were easier, when I long for a meal, to escape my own thoughts than them, so swiftly do they fly through the air. But if haply they do leave me a morsel of food it reeks of decay and the stench is unendurable, nor could any mortal bear to draw near even for a moment, no, not if his heart were wrought of adamant. But necessity, bitter and insatiate, compels me to abide and abiding to put food in my cursed belly.

For when he laboured the most and toiled the most, then the needs of life, ever growing more and more, would waste him, and day after day ever dawned more wretched, nor was there any respite to his toil.

And so the sons of <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a>, drenched and trembling in fear of a horrible doom, were borne along by the waves helplessly.

And here an inner-court was built, and round it were many well-fitted doors and chambers here and there, and all along on each side was a richly-wrought gallery. And on both sides loftier buildings stood obliquely.

And as a poor woman heaps dry twigs round a blazing brand — a daughter of toil, whose task is the spinning of wool, that she may kindle a blaze at night beneath her roof, when she has waked very early — and the flame waxing wondrous great from the small brand consumes all the twigs together; so, coiling round her heart, burnt secretly <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> the destroyer; and the hue of her soft cheeks went and came, now pale, now red, in her soul's distraction. </p>                        </div>

For even the birds of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> that haunted the desert isle beforetime, not even them did we find. But these men had driven them off, having landed from their ship on the day before; and the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> taking pity on us, or some fate, detained them there, since they straightway gave us both food and clothing in abundance, when they heard the illustrious name of <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a> and thine own; for to thy city are they faring. And if thou dost wish to know their errand, I will not hide it from time. A certain king, vehemently longing to drive this man far from his fatherland and possessions, because in might he outshone all the sons of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a>, sends him to voyage hither on a bootless venture; and asserts that the stock of <a href=/people/289 target=_blank>Aeolus</a> will not escape the heart-grieving wrath and rage of implacable <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, nor the unbearable curse and vengeance due for <a href=/people/548 target=_blank>Phrixus</a>, until the fleece comes back to Hellas. And their ship was fashioned by <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Pallas Athena</a>, not such a one as are the ships among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/431423RCol class=ethnic long=42.28 lat=42.12>Colchians</a>, on the vilest of which we chanced.

He has heard from me of thy bitter foes the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/490315RSar class=ethnic long=31.5 lat=49>Sauromatae</a>, and he will subdue them to thy sway.

And there, moving to and fro in the palace, she trod the ground forgetful of the heaven-sent woes thronging round her and of others that were destined to follow. And she called to her maids. Twelve they were, who lay during the night in the vestibule of her fragrant chamber, young as herself, not yet sharing the bridal couch, and she bade them hastily yoke the mules to the chariot to bear her to the beauteous shrine of <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>.

The dark juice of it, like the sap of a mountain-oak, she had gathered in a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400516WHyr class=demonym long=51.6 lat=40>Caspian</a> shell to make the charm withal, when she had first bathed in seven ever-flowing streams, and had called seven times on Brimo, nurse of youth, night-wandering Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead, — in the gloom of night, clad in dusky garments. And beneath, the dark earth shook and bellowed when the Titanian root was cut; and the son of <a href=/people/1418 target=_blank>Iapetus</a> himself groaned, his soul distraught with pain. And she brought the charm forth and placed it in the fragrant band which engirdled her, just beneath her bosom, divinely fair. And going forth she mounted the swift chariot, and with her went two handmaidens on each side. And she herself took the reins and in her right hand the well-fashioned whip, and drove through the city; and the rest, the handmaids, laid their hands on the chariot behind and ran along the broad highway; and they kilted up their light robes above their white knees.

And gazing over the field he saw the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>' yoke of bronze and near it the plough, all of one piece, of stubborn adamant. Then he came near, and fixed his sturdy spear upright on its butt, and taking his helmet, off leant it against the spear. And he went forward with shield alone to examine the countless tracks of the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a>, and they from some unseen lair beneath the earth, where was their strong steading, wrapt in murky smoke, both rushed out together, breathing forth flaming fire.

Then in front of him he held his shield; and both the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> with loud bellowing attacked him with their mighty horns; nor did they stir him a jot by their onset. And as when through the holes of the furnace the armourers' bellows anon gleam brightly, kindling the ravening flame, and anon cease from blowing, and a terrible roar rises from the fire when it darts up from below; so the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> roared, breathing forth swift flame from their mouths, while the consuming heat played round him, smiting like lightning; but the maiden's charms protected him. Then grasping the tip of the horn of the right- hand <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, he dragged it mightily with all his strength to bring it near the yoke of bronze, and forced it down on to its knees, suddenly striking with his foot the foot of bronze. So also he threw the other <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> on to its knees as it rushed upon him, and smote it down with one blow. And throwing to the ground his broad shield, he held them both down where they had fallen on their fore-knees, as he strode from side to side, now here, now there, and rushed swiftly through the flame. But <a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a> marvelled at the hero's might. And meantime the sons of <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a> for long since had it been thus ordained for them — near at hand gave him the yoke from the ground to cast round them. Then tightly did he bind their necks; and lifting the pole of bronze between them, he fastened it to the yoke by its golden tip. So the twin heroes started back from the fire to the ship. But <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> took up again his shield and cast it on his back behind him, and grasped the strong helmet filled with sharp teeth, and his resistless spear, wherewith, like some ploughman with a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/398223UPel class=demonym long=22.5 lat=39.5>Pelasgian</a> goad, he pricked the <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bulls</a> beneath, striking their flanks; and very firmly did he guide the well fitted plough handle, fashioned of adamant. </p>                        </div>

Them he scared in flight towards the plain; but he went back again to the ship, while he still saw the furrows free of the earthborn men. And all round his comrades heartened him with their shouts. And in the helmet he drew from the river's stream and quenched his thirst with the water. Then he bent his knees till they grew supple, and filled his mighty heart with courage, raging like a <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>boar</a>, when it sharpens its teeth against the hunters, while from its wrathful mouth plenteous foam drips to the ground. By now the earthborn men were springing up over all the field; and the plot of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a>, the death-dealer, bristled with sturdy shields and double-pointed spears and shining helmets; and the gleam reached <a about=https://topostext.org/place/401224LOly class=place long=22.3586 lat=40.0856>Olympus</a> from beneath, flashing through the air. And as when abundant snow has fallen on the earth and the storm blasts have dispersed the wintry clouds under the murky night, and all the hosts of the stars appear shining through the gloom; so did those warriors shine springing up above the earth. But <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> bethought him of the counsels of <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> full of craft, and seized from the plain a huge round boulder, a terrible quoit of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Ares</a> <a href=/people/1664 target=_blank>Enyalius</a>; four stalwart youths could not have raised it from the ground even a little. Taking it in his hands he threw it with a rush far away into their midst; and himself crouched unseen behind his shield, with full confidence.

And the Earthborn, like fleet-footed <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>, leaped upon one another and slew with loud yells; and on earth their mother they fell beneath their own spears, likes pines or oaks, which storms of wind beat down. And even as a fiery star leaps from heaven, trailing a furrow of light, a portent to men, whoever see it darting with a gleam through the dusky sky; in such wise did <a href=/people/467 target=_blank>Aeson</a>'s son rush upon the earthborn men, and he drew from the sheath his bare sword, and smote here and there, mowing them down, many on the belly and side, half risen to the air — and some that had risen as far as the shoulders — and some just standing upright, and others even now rushing to battle. And as when a fight is stirred up concerning boundaries, and a husbandman, in fear lest they should ravage his fields, seizes in his hand a curved sickle, newly sharpened, and hastily cuts the unripe crop, and waits not for it to be parched in due season by the beams of the sun; so at that time did <a href=/people/2578 target=_blank>Jason</a> cut down the crop of the Earthborn; and the furrows were filled with blood, as the channels of a spring with water. And they fell, some on their faces biting the rough clod of earth with their teeth, some on their backs, and others on their hands and sides, like to sea- monsters to behold. And many, smitten before raising their feet from the earth, bowed down as far to the ground as they had risen to the air, and rested there with the damp of death on their brows. Even so, I ween, when <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> has sent a measureless rain, new planted orchard-shoots droop to the ground, cut off by the root the toil of gardening men; but heaviness of heart and deadly anguish come to the owner of the farm, who planted them; so at that time did bitter grief come upon the heart of King <a href=/people/320 target=_blank>Aeetes</a>.

And ever on the watch from their place of prospect with its fair haven, often from many had they taken away their sweet return, consuming them with wasting desire; and suddenly to the heroes, too, they sent forth from their lips a lily-like voice.

Then, though <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> had ceased from his toils, the sea was still sending up a warm vapour. Hereupon on this side and on that the daughters of <a href=/people/428 target=_blank>Nereus</a> met them; and behind, lady <a href=/people/202 target=_blank>Thetis</a> set her hand to the rudder-blade, to guide them amid the Wandering rocks.

And when they were about to touch the Wandering rocks, straightway they raised the edge of their garments over their snow-white knees, and aloft, on the very rocks and where the waves broke, they hurried along on this side and on that apart from one another. And the ship was raised aloft as the current smote her, and all around the furious wave mounting up broke over the rocks, which at one time touched the sky like towering crags, at another, down in the depths, were fixed fast at the bottom of the sea and the fierce waves poured over them in floods. And the <a href=/people/590 target=_blank>Nereids</a>, even as maidens near some sandy beach roll their garments up to their waists out of their way and sport with a shapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and send it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so they in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over the waves, as it sped on ever away from the rocks; and round them the water spouted and foamed. And lord <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Hephaestus</a> himself standing on the summit of a smooth rock and resting his massy shoulder on the handle of his hammer, beheld them, and the spouse of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> beheld them as she stood above the gleaming heaven; and she threw her arms round <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Athena</a>, such fear seized her as she gazed. And as long as the space of a day is lengthened out in springtime, so long a time did they toil, heaving the ship between the loud-echoing rocks; then again the heroes caught the wind and sped onward; and swiftly they passed the mead of <a href=/people/4725 target=_blank>Thrinacia</a>, where the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a> of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a> fed.

And at the same time the bleating of <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> came to the heroes through the mist and the lowing of <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>, near at hand, smote their ears. And over the dewy leas <a href=/people/6113 target=_blank>Phaethusa</a>, the youngest of the daughters of <a href=/people/180 target=_blank>Helios</a>, tended the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a>, bearing in her hand a silver crook; while <a href=/people/6074 target=_blank>Lampetia</a>, herding the <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>, wielded a staff of glowing orichalcum as she followed. These <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a> the heroes saw feeding by the river's stream, over the plain and the water-meadow; not one of them was dark in hue but all were white as milk and glorying in their horns of gold. So they passed them by in the day-time, and when night came on they were cleaving a great sea-gulf, rejoicing, until again early rising dawn threw light upon their course. </p>                        </div>

Here accordingly the flood-tide — for this tide often retreats from the land and bursts back again over the beach coming on with a rush and roar — thrust them suddenly on to the innermost shore, and but little of the keel was left in the water.

And thus did one hero, vexed in spirit, ask another: What land is this? Whither has the tempest hurled us? Would that, reckless of deadly fear, we had dared to rush on by that same path between the clashing rocks! Better were it to have overleapt the will of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> and perished in venturing some mighty deed.

Now there lay in the sand, avoiding the midday heat, a dread <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a>, too sluggish of his own will to strike at an unwilling foe, nor yet would he dart full face at one that would shrink back. But into whatever of all living beings that life-giving earth sustains that <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpent</a> once injects his black venom, his path to <a href=/people/10685 target=_blank>Hades</a> becomes not so much as a cubit's length, not even if <a href=/people/3921 target=_blank>Paeeon</a>, if it is right for me to say this openly, should tend him, when its teeth have only grazed the skin. For when over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a> flew godlike <a href=/people/153 target=_blank>Perseus</a> <a href=/people/2140 target=_blank>Eurymedon</a> for by that name his mother called him — bearing to the king the <a href=/people/655 target=_blank>Gorgon</a>'s head newly severed, all the drops of dark blood that fell to the earth, produced a brood of those <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>serpents</a>. Now <a href=/people/872 target=_blank>Mopsus</a> stepped on the end of its spine, setting thereon the sole of his left foot; and it writhed round in pain and bit and tore the flesh between the shin and the muscles. And <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medea</a> and her handmaids fled in terror; but <a href=/people/3718 target=_blank>Canthus</a> bravely felt the bleeding wound; for no excessive pain harassed him. Poor wretch! Already a numbness that loosed his limbs was stealing beneath his skin, and a thick mist was spreading over his eyes. Straightway his heavy limbs sank helplessly to the ground and he grew cold; and his comrades and the hero, <a href=/people/467 target=_blank>Aeson</a>'s son, gathered round, marvelling at the close-coming doom. Nor yet though dead might he lie beneath the sun even for a little space. For at once the poison began to rot his flesh within, and the hair decayed and fell from the skin. And quickly and in haste they dug a deep grave with mattocks of bronze; and they tore their hair, the heroes and the maidens, bewailing the dead man's piteous suffering; and when he had received due burial rites, thrice they marched round the tomb in full armour, and heaped above him a mound of earth. </p>                        </div>
