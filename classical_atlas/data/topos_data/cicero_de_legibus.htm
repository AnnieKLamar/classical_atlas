It seems to me that in eulogizing your brother, you flatter your own vanity. <br />QUINTUS: You may rally me as much as you please, but as long as the Latin language is spoken, this oak of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a> will not lose its reputation; and as <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a> said of my brotherʼs poem on <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, it will Extend its hoary age, through countless years. <br />Do not your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> maintain that the olive near their citadel is immortal, and that tall and slender palm tree which Homerʼs <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a> says he beheld at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253SSan class=place long=25.2666 lat=37.4004>Delos</a>, do they not make an exhibition of it to this very day? and so with regard to other things, in many places, whose memorial endures beyond the term of their natural life.

But you must first inform me what you think of the tradition which asserts, that not far from your house at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, <a href=/people/2438 target=_blank>Proculus</a> <a href=/people/423 target=_blank>Julius</a> beheld our first king <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> walking after his decease, and that he heard him declare his desire of being invoked as a God, of being entitled <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>, and of having a temple there dedicated to his memory?

But some of these inquisitors, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, are really too severe. It is preposterous to expect an exact statement of matters of fact in a poem of this nature, as if I had written it not as a poet, but as an eye witness upon oath. I doubt not the same critics would make the same objections if I were to versify on Numaʼs intercourse with <a href=/people/3169 target=_blank>Egeria</a>, and the Eagle which dropped a coronet in the head of the first Tarquin. <br />QUINTUS: I understand you, my brother; you think that the historian must maintain a closer adherence to fact than the poet. <br />MARCUS: Certainly. History has its laws, and poetry its privileges. The main object of the former is truth in all its relations: the main object of the latter is delight and pleasure of every description. Yet even in <a href=/people/133 target=_blank>Herodotus</a>, the father of Greek history, and in <a href=/people/121 target=_blank>Theopompus</a>, we find fables scarcely less numerous than those which appear in the works of the poets. <br />ATTICUS: Stop there; I have found the occasion I wanted, and I shall not hesitate to urge my suit. <br />MARCUS: What suit, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>? <br />ATTICUS: We asked you, long ago, or rather implored you, to write a History of the Roman empire, for we conceive if you undertook this literary enterprise, even in the historical department, we should yield no palms or laurels to Greece. And if you will listen to my opinion, it seems to me that you owe this gift, not only to the affection of those who are delighted with your writings, but you likewise owe it to your country, that since you have saved her constitution, you should endeavour to adorn her annals, A good history of our country is a desideratum in our national literature, as I know by my own experience, and as I have often heard you declare. Now there is no man more likely than yourself to give general satisfaction in a work of this kind, since by your own avowal, it is of all the forms of composition that which most demands the eloquence of the orator. You would therefore be doing us a great favour if you would undertake this work, and devote your time to a complete history of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, which is unknown to most of our fellow-citizens, or at least neglected by them. For after the annals of the chief Pontiffs, which are very contracted, if we come to the book of <a href=/people/101 target=_blank>Fabius</a>, or <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, whom you are always eulogizing, or the treatises of <a href=/people/209 target=_blank>Piso</a>, <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>, and Venonius, though one of them may excel another, are they not all extremely defective? The contemporary of <a href=/people/1133 target=_blank>Fannius</a>, <a href=/people/2100 target=_blank>Coelius</a> <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a>, adopted a bolder style of expression. His energy was indeed somewhat rude and rough, without polish or point, but he did what he could to recommend a manly and truthful eloquence. But unfortunately he had for his successors a <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, an <a href=/people/2997 target=_blank>Asellio</a>, who, far from improving on him, relapsed into the former dullness and insipidity. <br />I scarcely need to mention <a href=/people/2292 target=_blank>Attius</a>. His loquacity is not without its fine points, though he has derived them not so much from the great Grecian authors, as from the Latin scribblers. His style is full of littlenesses and atrocious conceits. His friend <a href=/people/1851 target=_blank>Sisenna</a>, far surpasses all our historical writers whose compositions have yet been published, for of the rest we cannot judge. He has, however, never gained a name among the orators of your rank; and in his history he betrays a sort of puerility. He seems to have read no Greek author but <a href=/people/1776 target=_blank>Clitarchus</a>, and him he imitates without reserve, but even when he succeeds in his imitation, he is still far enough from the best style. Therefore the task of historian of right belongs to you, and we shall expect you to accomplish it, unless Quintus can bring forward any reasonable objections. <br />QUINTUS: I have nothing to say against it. Indeed we have often talked over the subject together, and I have made the same request as yourself; but we could never quite agree in our views of the subject. <br />ATTICUS: How so? <br />QUINTUS: Why we differed respecting the epoch from whence such a history should commence its narrative. In my opinion, it ought to begin with the origin of our state and nation, for the accounts that have hitherto been published respecting our primitive antiquities are so written as never to be read. My brother, on the other hand, wishes to confine himself to the events that have happened in our own times, so as only to describe those public affairs in which he himself bore a part. <br />ATTICUS: In this respect I rather agree with him. For the grandest events in Roman history are probably those that have taken place within our own recollection. He would then be able to illustrate the praises of our noble friend <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a>, and describe the memorable year of his own consulship. These memoirs, I imagine, would be far more interesting than any thing he could tell us respecting <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> and <a href=/people/622 target=_blank>Remus</a>. <br />MARCUS: I know, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, that you and other friends have long urged me to this undertaking, nor should I be at all unwilling to attempt it, if I could find more free and leisure time. But it is vain to enter on so extensive a work while my mind is harassed with cares, and my hands are full of business. Such literary enterprises demand a perfect freedom from anxieties and political embarassments.</p>                        </div>

For instance, if I spent a few days in rusticating at my country seat, I employed them in composing a part of the essays I had determined to write. But for an historical work, it is impossible to do it justice unless one can procure a regular vacation for a considerable period. My mind is thrown into a miserable state of suspense, when after fairly commencing a literary task, I am obliged to defer its conclusion to a future occasion; nor can I so easily recover the train of ideas in works so interrupted, as bring my essays to their appropriate conclusion, without rest or intermission. <br />ATTICUS: You therefore require a prolonged vacation for the historical treatise we propose, and a full allowance of holidays, with all their freedom and tranquility. <br />MARCUS: I conceive myself the better entitled to such vacations as I advance in life, since I am desirous, after the method of our ancestors, to continue the custom of giving magisterial advice to my clients, and thus to discharge the offices of old age gracefully and honourably. In such a situation, I should be able to compose not only the historical work you require, but others, still more extensive and diversified, with all desirable accuracy. <br />ATTICUS: I fear that few will accept such an apology for your retirement, and that you will be obliged to speak in public as long as you live. I regret this the more, as the lapse of years will compel you to change your manner of delivery, and your style of eloquence. Thus, your friend <a href=/people/1902 target=_blank>Roscius</a> the actor, in his old age, was forced to give up his most brilliant modulations, and to adapt the instrumental accompaniments to a slower measure. Thus you also, my Cicero, will find it necessary daily to relax from those lofty conflicts of oratory to which you have been accustomed, till your eloquence gradually assimilates to the bland garulity of the philosophers. Since, however, the extremest old age is still capable of executing some duties of patriotism, I see that your retirement will not hinder you from advising your clients. <br />QUINTUS: I think that the citizens of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> would readily grant you this kind of secession from public affairs, if you still consented to advise in legal matters. It is at your own option to try the experiment whenever you please. <br />MARCUS: Your advice, my Quintus, would be excellent if there were no danger in taking such a step. But I fear in thus seeking to diminish my labours I should rather increase them. I have an objection to thus aggravating the toil of public causes and prosecutions (which I never attempt to plead without full and mature study) by the addition of this professional interpretation of the laws, which would not distress me so much by its wearisomeness as by its tendency to deprive me of that preparation for speaking, without which I never dared to enter on any considerable pleadings. <br />ATTICUS: Whichever course, you resolve on, my Cicero, we have some spare time as you call it, at present, and I should be very glad if you would employ it in enlightening us respecting the laws of the state. On this subject I am sure you can give us something better than has hitherto been published. For even from your earliest youth, I remember, you have studied the laws, when I went like yourself to hear the lectures of <a href=/people/927 target=_blank>Scaevola</a>, nor did I ever find you so addicted to oratorical pursuits as to neglect your legal ones. <br />MARCUS: You seek to engage me in a long discussion, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>. However, I will not hesitate to undertake it unless Quintus prefers some other subject. If not, I will frankly tell you all I know about it, since at present we seem to be at leisure. <br />QUINTUS: I shall listen to you with the greatest pleasure, for what better subject can be discussed, or how can the day be spent more profitably? <br />MARCUS: Let us go then to our accustomed promenade, where they have placed the benches on which we may recline after we have had sufficient exercise. I flatter myself that our discussion will be agreeable enough, since we shall be able each of us to throw light on the several topics with which we are personally most familiar.. <br />ATTICUS: Let us go then, and enter on our investigations, as we walk along the bank of the river under the shadow of its foliage. And to begin with the beginning, let me ask I pray you, what is your opinion respecting the nature of Law? <br />MARCUS: What is my opinion? -- I hardly dare to deliver it, lest it should appear presumptuous. For we have had many great men in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, who have made it their profession to expound it to the people, and explain its doctrines and practice. But though they professed to be acquainted with its majestic theory, they were rather familiar with its minuter technicalities. What can be grander or nobler than jurisprudence? or what can be more insignificant and quibbling than the practice of lawyers? -- necessary as it is for the people. Not that I think that those who adopt this profession are altogether ignorant of the principles of universal legislation; but they are far more attentive to the civil law, which gives them a hold on the interests of the people. Are then the sublime and recondite principles of jurisprudence less necessary or less useful? Certainly not. It is these you wish me to elucidate and illustrate, and not the formal regulations of our civic economy. You ask me not to write treatises on the rights (stillicidiorum ac parietum) of common sewers and partition walls; and to compose forms of stipulations and judgments. These have been already most diligently prepared by clerks in office, and are decidedly lower than the topics which, I suppose, you expect me to discuss.</p>                        </div>

These, indeed, deserve much study and respect, inasmuch as they have occupied the attention of many great men, and are at present expounded by a most eminent lawyer (Servicius Sulpitius <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>) with admirable ability and skill. <br />But the subject of our present discussion soars far higher, and comprehends the universal principles of equity and law. In such a discussion therefore on the great moral law of nature, the practice of the civil law can occupy but an insignificant and subordinate station. For according to our idea, we shall have to explain the true nature of moral justice, which is congenial and correspondent with the true nature of man. We shall have to examine those principles of legislation by which all political states should be governed. And last of all, shall we have to speak of those laws and customs which are framed for the use and convenience of particular peoples, which regulate the civic and municipal affairs of the citizens, and which are known by the title of civil laws. <br />QUINTUS: You take a noble view of the subject, my brother, and go to the fountain-head of moral truth, in order to throw light on the whole science of jurisprudence: while those who confine their legal studies to the civil law too often grow less familiar with the arts of justice than with those of litigation. <br />MARCUS: Your observation, my Quintus, is not quite correct. It is not so much the science of law that produces litigation, as the ignorance of it, (potius ignoratio juris litigiosa est quam scientia). But more of this bye-and-bye. <br />With respect to the true principle of justice, many learned men have maintained that it springs from Law. I hardly know if their opinion be not correct, at least, according to their own definition; for Law (say they) is the highest reason, implanted in nature, which prescribes those things which ought to be done, and forbids the contrary. This, they think, is apparent from the converse of the proposition; because this same reason, when it is confirmed and established in menʼs minds, is the law of all their actions. <br />They therefore conceive that the voice of conscience is a law, that moral prudence is a law, whose operation is to urge us to good actions, and restrain us from evil ones. They think, too, that the Greek name for law (νόμος), which is derived from νέμω, to distribute, implies the very nature of the thing, that is, to give every man his due. For my part, I imagine that the moral essence of law is better expressed by its Latin name, (lex), which conveys the idea of selection or discrimination. According to the Greeks, therefore, the name of law implies an equitable distribution of goods: according to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a>, an equitable discrimation between good and evil. <br />The true definition of law should, however, include both these characteristics. And this being granted as an almost self-evident proposition, the origin of justice is to be sought in the divine law of eternal and immutable morality. This indeed is the true energy of nature, the very soul and essence of wisdom, the test of virtue and vice. But since every discussion must relate to some subject, whose terms are of frequent occurrence in the popular language of the citizens, we shall be sometimes obliged to use the same terms as the vulgar, and to conform to that common idiom which signifies by the word law, all the arbitrary regulations which are found in our statute books, either commanding or forbidding certain actions. <br />ATTICUS: Let us begin, then, to establish the principles of justice on that eternal and universal law, whose origin precedes the immeasurable course of ages, before legislative enactments were in being, or political governments constituted.</p>                        </div>

This reason, which is common to both, therefore, can be none other than right reason; and since this right reason is what we call Law, God and men are said by Law to be consociated. Between whom, since there is a communion of law, there must be also a communication of <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a>. <br />Law and <a href=/people/194 target=_blank>Justice</a> being thus the common rule of immortals and mortals, it follows that they are both the fellow-citizens of one city and commonwealth.

And as in earthly states, certain particular laws, which we shall hereafter describe, govern the particular relationships of kindred tribes; so in the nature of things doth an universal law, far more magnificent and resplendent, regulate the affairs of that universal city where gods and men compose one vast association. <br />When we thus reason on universal nature, we are accustomed to reason after this method. We believe that in the long course of ages and the uninterrupted succession of celestial revolutions, the seed of the human race was sown on our planet, and being scattered over the earth, was animated by the divine gift of souls. Thus men retained from their terrestrial origin, their perishable and mortal bodies, while their immortal spirits were ingenerated by Deity. From which consideration we are bold to say that we possess a certain consanguinity and kindred fellowship with the celestials.

This virtue is nothing else than a nature perfect in itself, and developed in all its excellence. There exists therefore a similitude between God and man; nor can any knowledge be more appropriate and sterling than what relates to this divine similitude. <br />Nature, attentive to our wants, offers us her treasures with the most graceful profusion. And it is easy to perceive that the benefits which flow from her are true and veritable gifts, which Providence has provided on purpose for human enjoyment, and not the fortuitous productions of her exuberant fecundity. Her liberality appears, not only in the fruits and vegetables which gush from the bosom of the earth, but likewise in <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cattle</a> and the beasts of the field. It is clear that some of these are intended for the advantage of mankind, a part for propagation, and a part for food. Innumerable arts have likewise been discovered by the teaching of nature; for her doth reason imitate, and skilfully discover all things necessary to the happiness of life. <br />With respect to man this same bountiful nature hath not merely allotted him a subtle and active spirit, but moreover favoured him with physical senses, like so many guardians and messengers. Thus has she improved our understanding in relation to many obscure principles, and laid the foundation of practical knowledge; and in all respects moulded our corporeal faculties to the service of our intellectual genius. For while she has debased the forms of other animals, who live to eat rather than eat to live, she has bestowed on man an erect stature, and an open countenance, and thus prompted him to the contemplation of heaven, the ancient home of his kindred immortals.

And that which we call expression in which we infinitely excel all the inferior animals, how marvellously it delineates all our speculations and feelings! Of this the Greeks well knew the meaning, though they had no word for it. <br />I will not enlarge on the wonderful faculties and qualities of the rest of the body, the modulation of the voice, and the power of oratory, which is perhaps the greatest instrument of our influence over human society. These matters do not belong to the occasion of our present discourse, and I think that <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> has already sufficiently explained them in those books of mine which you have read. <br />As the Deity, therefore, was pleased to create man as the chief and president of all terrestrial creatures, so it is evident, without further argument, that human nature has made the greatest advances by its intrinsic energy; that nature, which without any other instruction than her own, has developed the first rude principles of the understanding, and strengthened and perfected reason to all the appliances of science and art. <br />ATTICUS: Good heavens, my Cicero! from what a tremendous distance are you deducing the principles of justice! However, I wont hurry too eagerly to what I expect you to say on the Civil Law. But I will listen patiently, even if you spend the whole day in this kind of discourse, for assuredly these are grander topics which you introduce as a preamble than those to which they prepare the way. <br />MARCUS: You may well describe these topics as grand, which we are now briefly discussing. For of all the questions on which our philosophers argue, there is none which it is more important thoroughly to understand than this, that man is born for justice, and that law and equity are not a mere establishment of opinion, but an institution of nature. This truth will become still more apparent if we investigate the nature of human association and society. <br />There is no one thing more like to another, more homogeneous and analogous, than man is to man. And if the corruption of customs, and the variation of opinions, had not induced an imbecility of minds, and turned them aside from the course of nature, no one would more nearly resemble himself than all men would resemble all men. Therefore whatever definition we give of man, it must include the whole human race. And this is a good argument, that no portion of mankind can be heterogeneous or dissimilar from the rest; because, if this were the case, one definition could not include all men. <br />In fact, reason, which alone gives us so many advantages over beasts, by means of which we conjecture, argue, refute, discourse, and accomplish and conclude our designs, is assuredly common to all men; for the faculty of acquiring knowledge is similar in all human minds, though the knowledge itself may be endlessly diversified. By the same senses we all perceive the same objects, and that which strikes the sensibilities of the few, cannot be indifferent to those of the many. Those first rude elements of intelligence which, as I before observed, are the earliest developments of thought, are similarly exhibited by all men; and that faculty of speech which is the soulʼs interpreter, agrees in the ideas it conveys, though it may differ in the syllables that express them. And therefore there exists not a man in any nation, who, adopting his true nature for his true guide, may not improve in virtue. <br />Nor is this resemblance which all men bear to each other remarkable in those things only which accord to right reason. For it is scarcely less conspicuous in those corrupt practices by which right reason is most cruelly violated. For all men alike are captivated by voluptuousness, which is in reality no better than disgraceful vice, though it may seem to bear some natural relations to goodness; for by its delicious delicacy and luxury it insinuates error into the mind, and leads us to cultivate it as something salutary, forgetful of its poisonous qualities. <br />An error, scarcely less universal, induces us to shun death, as if it were annihilation; and to cling to life, because it keeps us in our present stage of existence, which is perhaps rather a misfortune than a desideratum. Thus, likewise, we erroneously consider pain as one of the greatest evils, not only on account of its present asperity, but also because it seems the precursor of mortality. Another common delusion obtains, which induces all mankind to associate renown with honesty, as if we are necessarily happy when we are renowned, and miserable when we happen to be inglorious. <br />In short, our minds are all similarly susceptible of inquietudes, joys, desires and fears; and if opinions are not the same in all men, it does not follow, for example, that the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> who deify <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> and <a href=/people/556 target=_blank>cats</a>, do not labour under superstition in the same way as other nations, though they may differ from them in the forms of its manifestation. <br />But in nothing is the uniformity of human nature more conspicuous than in its respect for virtue. What nation is there, in which kindness, benignity, gratitude, and mindfulness of benefits are not recommended? What nation in which arrogance, malice, cruelty, and unthankfulness, are not reprobated and detested! This uniformity of opinions, invincibly demonstrates that mankind was intended to compose one fraternal association. And to affect this, the faculty of reason must be improved till it instructs us in all the arts of well-living. If what I have said meets your approbation, I will proceed; or if any of my argument appears defective, I will endeavour to explain it. <br />ATTICUS: We see nothing to object to, if I may reply for both of us. <br />MARCUS: It follows, then, in the line of our argument, that nature made us just that we might participate our goods with each other, and supply each others’ wants. You observe in this discussion whenever I speak of nature, I mean nature in its genuine purity, and not in the corrupt state which is displayed by the depravity of evil custom, which is so great, that the natural and innate flame of virtue is often almost extinguished and stifled by the antagonist vices, which are accumulated around it. <br />But if our true nature would assert her rights, and teach men the noble lesson of the poet, who says, I am a man, therefore no human interest can be indifferent to me, -- then would justice be administered equally by all and to all. For nature hath not merely given us reason, but right reason, and consequently that law, which is nothing else than right reason enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil. <br />Now if nature hath given us law, she hath also given us justice, -- for as she has bestowed reason on all, she has equally bestowed the sense of justice on all. And therefore did <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> deservedly execrate the man who first drew a distinction between the law of nature and the law of morals, for he justly conceived that this error is the source of most human vices. <br />It is to this essential union between the naturally honorable, and the politically expedient, that this sentence of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> refers: -- <a href=/people/38 target=_blank>Love</a> is universal: let its benefits be universal likewise.</p>                        </div>

For how can a difference of interests arise where all interests are similar? If there could be such a difference of interests, however minute, it would be no longer a true friendship, which vanishes immediately when, for the sake of our own benefit, we would sacrifice that of our friend. <br />I have made these preliminary remarks, to prepare you the better for the main subject of our discourse, in order that you may more easily understand the principle, that nature herself is the foundation of justice. When I have explained this a little more at large, I shall come to the consideration of that civil law to which all my arguments refer. <br />QUINTUS: Then you have not much to add, my brother, for the arguments you have already used have sufficiently proved to <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> and myself that nature is the fountain of justice. <br />ATTICUS: How could I maintain any other opinion, since you have proved to us, first, that the gods have been pleased to enrich and adorn us with their gifts, on purpose that we might administer them justly. Secondly, that all mankind bear a fraternal resemblance and relationship to each other. And lastly, that these natural brethren are bound together by the reciprocal obligations of friendship and affection, as well as social rights.

I do not mean the older sages of philosophy, but those modern philosophers who keep a magazine of arguments in reserve, on every imaginable topic, and who, instead of discussing questions freely and unconstrainedly, will permit us to speak only in accordance with their logical arrangements and dialectical distinctions. These gentlemen will never allow that we have done justice to our subject, unless we demonstrate that nature is just, and justice is natural, in a distinct and scientific disputation. <br />ATTICUS: You seem to have renounced your liberty in debate, my Cicero, and resemble a schoolman, who rather follows the authority of his predecessors, than developes his individual sentiments. <br />MARCUS: I am not always in this humour, <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>.

As to that new academy of which <a href=/people/2092 target=_blank>Arcesilas</a> and <a href=/people/711 target=_blank>Carneades</a> are the leaders, and who attack all sects and parties, we implore them not to interrupt us in our present discussion; for if they invade us on these subjects in which our minds are thoroughly familiar and resolved, they will seek their own ruin. But I, who wish rather to please, dare not excite their resentment; for in questions of this nature, we would fain proceed without any mixture of sophistry or anger; and any defects in our arguments, may surely be expiated without such fumigations as the invectives of criticism. <br />ATTICUS: As you use the word 'expiation,' permit me to enquire what views you entertain respecting the justice of punishment, where laws have been broken and violated. Do you think such offences against laws can be expiated without enforcing the penalty, either directly or indirectly? <br />MARCUS: I think not. I conceive there is no other expiation for the crimes and impieties of men. The guilty therefore must pay the penalty, and bear the punishment. The retributions they undergo are not so much those inflicted by courts of justice, which were not always in being, do not exist at present in many places, and even where established, are frequently biased and partial; but the retributions I principally intend are those of conscience. The Furies pursue and torment them, not with their burning torches, as the poets feign, but by remorse and the tortures arising from guilt. <br />Was it the fear of punishment, and not the nature of the thing itself that ought to restrain mankind from wickedness, what, I would ask, could give villains the least uneasiness, abstracting from all fears of this kind? And yet none of them was ever so audaciously impudent, but he endeavoured to justify what he had done by some law of nature, denied the fact, or else pretended a just sorrow for it. Now if the wicked have the confidence to appeal to these laws, with what profound respect ought good men to treat them? <br />There is the greater need, therefore, of insisting on the natural and unavoidable penalties of conscience.

Are then the laws of tyrants just, simply because they are laws? If the thirty tyrants of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> imposed certain laws on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and if these <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were delighted with these tyrannical laws, are we therefore bound to consider these laws as just? For my own part, I do not think such laws deserve any greater estimation than that past during our own interregnum, which ordained, that the dictator should be empowered to put to death with impunity, whatever citizens he pleased, without hearing them in their own defence. <br />There can be but one essential justice, which cements society, and one law which establishes this justice. This law is right reason, which is the true rule of all commandments and prohibitions. Whoever neglects this law, whether written or unwritten, is necessarily unjust and wicked. <br />But if justice consists in submission to written laws and national customs, and if, as the <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a> persist in affirming, every thing must be measured by utility alone, he who wishes to find an occasion of breaking such laws and customs, will be sure to discover it. So that real justice remains powerless if not supported by nature, and this pretended justice is overturned by that very utility which they call its foundation. <br />But this is not all. If nature does not ratify law, all the virtues lose their sway. What becomes of generosity, patriotism, or friendship? Where should we find the desire of benefitting our neighbours, or the gratitude that acknowledges kindness? For all these virtues proceed from our natural inclination to love and cherish our associates. This is the true basis of justice, and without this, not only the mutual charities of men, but the religious services of the gods, would become obsolete; for these are preserved, as I imagine, rather by the natural sympathy which subsists between divine and human beings, than by mere fear and timidity. <br />If the will of the people, the decrees of the senate, the adjudications of magistrates, were sufficient to establish justice, the only question would be how to gain suffrages, and to win over the votes of the majority, in order that corruption and spoliation, and the falsification of wills, should become lawful. But if the opinions and suffrages of foolish men had sufficient weight to outbalance the nature of things, might they not determine among them, that what is essentially bad and pernicious should henceforth pass for good and beneficial? Or why should not a law able to enforce injustice, take the place of equity? Would not this same law be able to change evil into good, and good into evil? <br />As far as we are concerned, we have no other rule capable of distinguishing between a good or a bad law, than our natural conscience and reason. These, however, enable us to separate justice from injustice, and to discriminate between the honest and the scandalous. For common sense has impressed in our minds the first principles of things, and has given us a general acquaintance with them, by which we connect with <a href=/people/323 target=_blank>Virtue</a> every honourable and excellent quality, and with <a href=/people/12002 target=_blank>Vice</a> all that is abominable and disgraceful. <br />Now we must entirely take leave of our senses, ere we can suppose that law and justice have no foundation in nature, and rely merely on the transient opinions of men. We should not venture to praise the virtue of a tree or a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, in which expression there is an abuse of terms, were we not convinced that this virtue was in their nature, rather than in our opinion. For a stronger reason, it is mainly with respect to the moral nature of things, that we ought to speak of honour and shame among men. <br />If opinion could determine respecting the character of universal virtue, it might also decide respecting particular or partial virtues. But who will dare to determine that a man is prudent and cautious in his moral disposition, from any external appearances. For virtue evidently lies in perfect rationality, and this resides in the inmost depths of our nature. The same remark applies to all honour and honesty, for we judge of true and false, creditable and discreditable, rather by their essential qualities, than their external relations. Thus we judge according to their intrinsic nature, that rationality of life, which is virtue, must be ever constant and perpetual, and that inconstancy must necessarily be vicious. <br />We form an estimate of the opinions of youths, but not by their opinions. Those virtues and vices which reside in their moral natures, must not be measured by opinions. And so of all moral qualities, we must discriminate between honourable and dishonourable by reference to the essential nature of the things themselves. <br />The good we commend, must needs contain in itself something commendable. For as I before stated, goodness is not a mode of opinion: it is what it is, by the force of its very essence. If it were otherwise, opinion alone might constitute virtue and happiness, which is the most absurd of suppositions. And since we judge of good and evil by their nature, and since good and evil are the true constituents of honour and shame, we should judge in the same manner all honourable and all shameful qualities, testing them by the law of nature, without prejudice or passion.</p>                        </div>

Those objects, indeed, which sometimes present to us one appearance, sometimes another, we term fictions of the senses; but it is far otherwise. For neither parent, nor nurse, nor master, nor poet, nor drama, deceive our senses; nor do popular prejudices seduce them. But our delusions are connected with corruption of our mental opinions. And this corruption is either superinduced by those causes of error I have enumerated, which, taking possession of the young and uneducated, betray them into a thousand perversities, or by that voluptuousness which is the mimic of goodness, implicated and interfused through all our senses -- the prolific mother of all human disasters.

What then shall we say of liberality? Is it to be exercised gratuituously, or does it covet some reward and recompense? If a man does good without expecting any recompense for his kindness, then it is gratuitous: if he does expect compensation, it is a mere matter of traffic. Doubtless, he who truly deserves the reputation of a generous and good-natured man, performs his philanthropical duties without consulting his secular interests. In the same way the virtue of justice demands neither emolument nor salary, and therefore we desire it for its own sake, because it is its own reward.

For the more a manʼs views are self-interested, the further he recedes from probity. It therefore necessarily happens, that those who measure virtue by profit, acknowledge no other virtue than this usurious vice. For who could he called benevolent, if none endeavoured to do good for the love of others? Where could we find the grateful person, if those who are disposed to gratitude could meet no benefactor disinterested enough to deserve it? What would become of sacred friendship, if we were not to love our friends for their own sake with all our heart and soul? In pursuance of this pseudo-benovelence, we must desert our friend, as soon as we can derive no further assistance from him. What can be more inhuman! But if friendship ought rather to be cultivated on its own account, for the same reason are society, equality, and justice, desirable for themselves. If this were not so, there could be no justice at all, since nothing is more opposite to the very essence of virtue than selfish interest. <br />What then shall we say of temperance, sobriety, continence, modesty, bashfulness, and chastity? Is it the fear of laws, or the dread of judgments and penalties, which restrain intemperance and dissoluteness?

And when we blush at licentious discourse, is it only through a squeamish prudery, lest our reputation should be stained? How I am ashamed at those philosophers, who assert that there are no vices to be avoided but those which the laws have branded with infamy. Can it be said that those are truly chaste, who abstain from adultery, merely for the fear of public exposure, and that disgrace which is only one of its many evil consequences? Indeed, my dear <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, what can you praise or blame with reason, if you depart from that great law and rule of nature, which makes the difference between right and wrong? Shall corporal defects, if they are remarkable, shock our sensibilities, and shall those of the soul make no impression on us? -- Of the soul, I say, whose turpitude is so evidently proved by its vices. For what is there more hideous than avarice, more ferocious than lust, more contemptible than cowardice, more base than stupidity and folly? Well, therefore, may we style unhappy, those persons in whom any one of these vices is conspicuous, not on account of the disgraces or losses to which they are exposed, but on account of the moral baseness of their sins. <br />We may apply the same ethical test to those who are distinguished for their virtue. For if virtue be not the highest excellence to which we aspire, it necessarily follows that there is something better than virtue. Is it money, fame, beauty, health? All these appear of little value to us when we possess them, especially when we consider that the duration of their enjoyment is altogether uncertain. Is it that basest of all things, voluptuousness? Certainly not; for nothing gives so much dignity to virtue, as its capacity of overruling and despising all the gratifications of secular and sensual life. <br />You see the long series of facts and arguments I have brought forward. Such is the connection between one doctrine of truth and another, -- I should have proceeded further still, if I had not kept myself in check. <br />QUINTUS: To what point do your arguments tend, my brother? -- for I would willingly go hand in hand with you through this discussion. <br />MARCUS: The point they bear on, is the moral end of our actions, (ad finem bonorum) to which all things are to be referred, and for the sake of which all things are to be undertaken. This subject is, however, one of great controversy, and full of debate among the learned; yet I shall some day venture to publish my opinions respecting it.</p>                        </div>

Here was our altar, here our ancestry, and here still remains many vestiges of our family. Besides, this villa which you behold in its present form, was originally constructed under my fatherʼs superintendence; for having very infirm health, he spent the later years of his life here, engaged in literary pursuits. At the time of my birth, my grandfather also lived here, and resided according to the olden custom, in that little villa, like another <a href=/people/1004 target=_blank>Curius</a> on his Sabine farm.

I cannot tell you how this affection arises, but certainly we cannot behold, without emotion, the spots where we find traces of those who possess our esteem or admiration. For my own part, if any thing attaches me to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, it is not so much the accumulation of a multitude of invaluable antiques, as the rememberance of great men, whom I represent to myself as living, reposing there, and discoursing there.

But what were you going to say just now, when you called this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/416136UArp class=place long=13.61 lat=41.648>Arpinum</a> the true country of yourself and your brother Quintus? Have you more than one country, or any other than that Roman Commonwealth in which we have a similar interest? In that sense, the true country of the philosophic <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> would not have been <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, but <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>. <br />MARCUS: In reply to your question, I should say, that <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a>, and municipal citizens like him, have two countries, one, that of their birth, and the other, that of their choice. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> being born at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, was elected a citizen of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, so that a <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=demonym long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculan</a> by extraction, and a Roman by election, he had, besides his native country, a rightful one. So among your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, before <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a> urged them to quit their rural territories, and assembled them at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, those that were natives of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376240LSou class=place long=24.0247 lat=37.6498>Sunium</a>, were reckoned as Sunians and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> at the same time. In the same way, we may justly entitle as our country, both the place from where we originated, and that to which we have been associated. It is necessary, however, that we should attach ourselves by a preference of affection to the latter, which, under the name of the Commonwealth, is the common country of us all. For this country it is, that we ought to sacrifice our lives; it is to her that we ought to devote ourselves without reserve; and it is for her that we ought to risk and hazard all our riches and our hopes.

Therefore, that aboriginal and supreme law is the Spirit of God himself; enjoining virtue, and restraining vice. For this reason it is, that this law, which the gods have bestowed on the human race, is so justly applauded. For it is the reason and mind of <a href=/people/603 target=_blank>Wisdom</a>, urging us to good, and deterring us from evil. <br />QUINTUS: You have already touched on this topic. But before you come to treat of civil laws, endeavour to explain the force and power of this divine and celestial law, lest the torrent of custom should overwhelm our understanding, and betray us into the vulgar method of expression. <br />MARCUS: From little children have we learned, my Quintus, such phrases as this, that a man appeals to justice, and goes to law and a great many municipal laws have we heard mentioned; but we should not understand that such commandments and prohibitions have sufficient moral power to make us practise virtue and avoid vice. <br />The moral power of law, is not only far more ancient than these legal institutions of states and peoples, but it is coeval with God himself, who beholds and governs both heaven and earth. For it is impossible that the divine mind should exist without reason; and divine reason must necessarily be possessed of a power to determine what is virtuous and what is vicious. Nor, because it was nowhere written, that one man should maintain the pass of a bridge against the enemyʼs whole army, and that he should order the bridge behind him to be cut down, are we therefore to imagine that the valiant <a href=/people/3807 target=_blank>Cocles</a> did not perform this great exploit, agreeably to the laws of nature and the dictates of true bravery. Again, though in the reign of Tarquin there was no written law concerning adultery, it does not therefore follow that <a href=/people/191 target=_blank>Sextus</a> <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> did not offend against the eternal law when he committed a rape on <a href=/people/12037 target=_blank>Lucretia</a>, daughter of Tucipitinus. For, even then he had the light of reason deduced from the nature of things, that incites to good actions and dissuades from evil ones. And this has the force of a law, not from the time it was written, but from the first moment it began to exist. Now, this existence of moral obligation is coeternal with that of the divine mind. Therefore the true and supreme law, whose commands and prohibitions are equally infallible, is the right reason of the Sovereign Deity. <br />QUINTUS: I grant you, my brother, that whatever is the just is always the true law; nor can this true law either be originated or abrogated by any written enactments. <br />MARCUS: Therefore, as the Divine Mind, or reason, is the supreme law, so it exists in the mind of the sage, so far as it can be perfected in man. With respect to civil laws, which differ in all ages and nations, the name of law belongs to them not so much by right as by the favour of the people. For every law which deserves the name of a law ought to be morally good and laudable, as we might demonstrate by the following arguments. It is clear, that laws were originally made for the security of the people, for the preservation of cities, for the peace and benefit of society. Doubtless, the first legislators persuaded the people that they would write and publish such laws only as should conduce to the general morality and happiness, if they would receive and obey them. Such were the regulations, which being settled and sanctioned, they justly entitled Laws. From which we may reasonably conclude, that those who made unjustifiable and pernicious enactments for the people, counteracted their own promises and professions; and established any thing rather than laws, properly so called, since it is evident that the very signification of the word law, comprehends the essence and energy of justice and equity. <br />I would therefore interrogate you on this point, my Quintus, like our inquisitive philosophers. If a state wants something, wanting which it is reckoned no state, must not that something be something good? (Quaero igitur a te Quinte, sicut illi solent, -- quo si civitas careat, ob eam ipsam causam quod eo careat, pro nihilo habenda sit, id est ne numerandum in bonis?) <br />QUINTUS: A very great good. <br />MARCUS: Now a state which has no law, is it not for that reason to be reckoned no state? <br />QUINTUS: We must needs say so. <br />MARCUS: We must therefore reckon law among the very best things. <br />QUINTUS: I entirely agree with you. <br />MARCUS: If then in the majority of nations, many pernicious and mischievous enactments are made, as far removed from the law of justice we have defined as the mutual engagements of robbers, are we bound to call them laws? For as we cannot call the recipes of ignorant empirics, who give poisons instead of medicines, the prescriptions of a physician, we cannot call that the true law of the people, whatever be its name, if it enjoins what is injurious, let the people receive it as they will. For law is the just distinction between right and wrong, conformable to nature, the original and principal regulator of all things, by which the laws of men should be measured, whether they punish the guilty or protect the innocent. <br />QUINTUS: I quite agree with you, and think that no law but that of justice should either be proclaimed as a law or enforced as a law.</p>                        </div>

But that law of justice, which I have explained can never be rendered obsolete or inefficacious. <br />QUINTUS: And, therefore, you require those laws of justice the more ardently, because they would be durable and permanent, and would not require those perpetual alterations which all injudicious enactments demand. <br />MARCUS: Certainly, if I could get you both to agree with me. But <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>, that wisest philosopher, that gravest prince of literature, who first composed his Commonwealth, and afterwards his Treatise on the Laws, induces me to follow his illustrious example, and to proclaim the praises of law, before I begin to recite its regulations.

Who will dispute the utility of these sentiments, when he shall reflect how many cases of the greatest importance are decided by oaths; how much the sacred rites performed in making treaties tend to assure peace and tranquility; also, what numbers the fear of divine punishment has reclaimed from a vicious course of life; and how sacred the social rights must be in a society where a firm persuasion obtains of the immediate intervention of the immortal gods, both as witnesses and judges of our actions?

These legal maxims, I shall mention with as much brevity as possible; and I shall endeavour to expound the laws, not indeed in their whole extent, for this would be infinitely laborious, but those which involve the principles and contain the sum and substance of the rest. <br />QUINTUS: This appears a most desirable method: let us therefore hear the <br />MARCUS: Such are the following; -- Approach the gods with purity -- appear before them in the spirit of devotion -- remove riches from their temples; whoever doth otherwise shall suffer the vengeance of heaven -- let no one have private gods -- neither new gods nor strange gods, unless publicly acknowledged, are to be worshiped privately -- let the temples which the fathers have constructed in the cities, be upheld -- let the sacred chapels and consecrated groves in country places be protected -- let the customs of the fathers be preserved in the families -- let the gods who have always been accounted celestial be worshipped, and those gods likewise who have merited celestial honours by their illustrious actions, as <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Bacchus</a>, <a href=/people/114 target=_blank>Aesculapius</a>, <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a>, <a href=/people/327 target=_blank>Pollux</a> and <a href=/people/773 target=_blank>Quirinus</a>. Let due honour be likewise paid to those virtues, by which man is exalted to heaven, -- as intelligence, valour, piety, fidelity; and let temples be consecrated to them. But with regard to the vices, let no sacred sacrifices be paid to them. <br />Let all contentions of every kind cease on the sacred festivals, and let servants enjoy them, their toils being remitted, for therefore they were appointed at certain seasons. -- Let the priests duly render the public thank-offerings to heaven, with herbs and fruits, on the sacrificial days. Also, on the appointed holidays, let them offer up the cream of milk, and the sucklings; and lest the priests should commit any mistakes in these sacrifices, or the reason of these sacrifices, let them carefully observe the calendar, and the revolutions of the stars. -- Let them provide those particular sacrifices which are most appropriate and agreeable to the particular deities: the Priests directing the service of some gods, the Flamens regulating the rites of others, and the Pontiffs superintending the worship of all. <br />Let the <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>Vestal Virgins</a> in the city carefully keep the sempiternal fire always burning on the public altar, and let those who are not instructed in the order of the ceremonials in these private and public ministrations, learn them from the priests. Let there be two classes of these priests, one to preside over ceremonials and sacrifices, and another to interpret the obscure predictions of the prophets, diviners, and sibyls, whenever the senate or the people require it. -- Let the public Augurs, who are the interpreters of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, the best and greatest, likewise examine the presages and auspices, according to the discipline of their art. Let the priests who are conversant in auguries implore the prosperity of the vineyards and gardens, and the general welfare of the people. -- Let those who give counsel in military or civic affairs, attend to the auspices, and take their measures accordingly. -- Let them observe from what parts of heaven the lightnings burst forth. -- Let them declare what lands, cities, and temples, are to be held free and consecrated. -- Whatever things the augur declares to be unjust, wicked, vicious, and accursed, let them be forsaken as prohibited and disastrous, and whoever will not obey these divine indications, let him suffer capital punishment. <br />As to alliances, peace, war, truces, and the rights of ambassadors, the Fetial priests are the appropriate judges, who determine all questions relating to military affairs. The interpretation of all prodigies and portents, belongs to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/430105RTyr class=ethnic long=10.5 lat=43>Etruscans</a> and Haruspices, if the senate seeks their advice, and these shall inform the partricians respecting the line of conduct they should pursue. Then will they learn what deities it behoves them to propitiate, and deprecate the fury of the thunderbolt against the object of its vengeance. (Quibus divis creverint, procuranto; iidemque fulgura, atque obstita pianto). <br />Let nocturnal sacrifices be interdicted to women, except those they offer according to popular custom -- and let none be initiated in the mysteries except by the usual forms consecrated to <a href=/people/48 target=_blank>Ceres</a>, according to the Grecian ceremonials. (Neve quem initianto, nisi ut assolet Cereri, Graeco sacro.) <br />Let there be sacrifice made, (by the criminal) for crimes which cannot be expiated (by the priest), being acts of impiety, -- the faults which can be expiated by the public priests, let them expiate. (Sacrum commissum, quod neque expiari poterit, impie commissum esto -- quod expiari poterit, publici sacerdotes expianto.) <br />With regard to public spectacles, excepting those of the race-course and the ring, let them restrain the violence of the people, by the soothing influence of vocal and instrumental music; and let the honours of the gods be inseperable from the amusements of these diversions. Let them retain whatever is best and purest in the ancient form of worship. Except the devotees of <a href=/people/366 target=_blank>Cybele</a> (ideae matris famulos), to whom this privilege is allowed on certain days, let no one presume to levy rates for private emolument. Whoever purloins or robs the sacred property of the temples, let the sacreligious wretch be accounted as no better than a parricide. The divine punishment of perjury is destruction: the human penalty is infamy. With regard to incest, let the chief priests sentence it to the extremest penalty of the law. <br />Let not the impious man, who should render sacrifice, attempt to appease the gods by gifts and offerings. Let vows be piously performed. Whereever law is violated, let its punishments be executed. Let no private person presume to consecrate his land; and let his consecration of gold, silver and ivory, be made within the limits of moderation. Let private devotions be perpetually practised. Let the rights of the deities of the dead be punctually discharged. Let those who have past into the world of souls be considered as divinified; thus unnecessary expense and sorrow with regard to our departed friends will be reduced and diminished.

For if in our social relations we desire that distinctions of wealth and poverty should not induce us to forget the fraternal equality of men; why should we throw a stumbling block in the approaches of mortals to their Maker, by requiring costly sacrifices and offerings. Especially since nothing is more agreeable to the deity than to see the gates of worship flung open to all who would adore him, and serve him in his temples. <br />When the latter part of this legal maxim is added, which declares that God is not merely the judge, but the avenger of ecclesiastical abuses, the sense of religion is strengthened by the fear of immediate punishment which awaits the offender.</p>                        </div>

The Greeks, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> after them, have adopted a more rational opinion, since in order to confirm the devotion we entertain for the gods, we have allotted to them fixed mansions in our cities, no less than to our fellow-citizens. This opinion promotes religion, and has a useful moral influence on society. For according to the noble sentence of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, then chiefly do piety and religion flourish in our souls, when we are occupied in divine services. And according to <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a>, the most renowned of the seven sages of Greece, men should be persuaded that the gods behold all things, and inform all things. And therefore are all men the more pure and holy when they frequent the sanctuaries of the gods, for there, in a certain sense, they have the divine images, not only impressed on their minds, but actually presented before their eyes.</p>                        </div>

I do not speak this from any motive of personal vanity, since I am an augur myself, but because it is an actual matter of fact. For what can be more important in respect of official dignities, than the power of dismissing the assembly of the Commons, though convoked by the chief rulers, and thus annulling their counsels and enactments? What, I say, can be more absolute domination than that by which even a single augur can adjourn any political proceeding to another day! What can be more transcendent than that authority of the augurs, by which they may command even consuls to lay down their office! What more sacred than their power of granting or refusing permission to form treaties and compacts! or their power of abrogating laws, which have not been legitimately enacted, as in the case of the Titian law, which was annulled by a decree of the pontifical college; and the Livian law, which was likewise annulled by the advice of Phillipus, who was at once consul and augur. Indeed there is no edict of the magistrates relating either to domestic or foreign affairs which can be ratified without the augurʼs authority. <br />ATTICUS: I confess that their authority is very great; but there is a warm dispute between <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a> and <a href=/people/176 target=_blank>Appius</a>, two of the best augurs in our college. I have met with the books of both, and I find that one of them affirms that auspices are merely got up for the interests of the state, and the other seems to think that they really are supernatural divinations. Will you favour us with your opinion on this point? <br />MARCUS: For myself, I sincerely believe that there exists an art which the Greeks call Mantike, or magic; and that the flight of birds and other signs, which the augurs profess to observe, form a part of this magic. For when we grant the existence of the supreme gods, and their intellectual government of the universe, and their benignant dealings with the human race, and their power of granting us intimations of future events, I know not why we should deny the art of divination. <br />Besides this, the history of our Commonwealth affords us an infinite number of examples, which confirm this truth, and all kingdoms, peoples, and nations bear testimony that the predictions of augurs are wonderfully fulfilled. Thus the traditions of <a href=/people/2687 target=_blank>Polyidus</a>, <a href=/people/790 target=_blank>Melampus</a>, <a href=/people/872 target=_blank>Mopsus</a>, <a href=/people/284 target=_blank>Amphiaraus</a>, <a href=/people/662 target=_blank>Calchas</a>, and <a href=/people/515 target=_blank>Helenus</a>, would not have made so much noise in the world, nor would they at this time be accredited by so many nations, -- <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr class=ethnic long=31 lat=40>Phrygians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375324RLyk class=ethnic long=32.4 lat=37.5>Lycaonians</a>, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil class=ethnic long=34.01 lat=37.01>Cilicians</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370306RPis class=ethnic long=30.6 lat=37.01>Pisidians</a>, -- unless antiquity had handed them down as true and indisputable. Nor would our <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> have consulted the auspices before he founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, nor would the name of <a href=/people/1390 target=_blank>Accius</a> <a href=/people/3903 target=_blank>Navius</a> have so long flourished in the memory of our citizens, if events had not justified their wonderful predictions. But doubtless this science and art of augury may vanish away by age and negligence. Therefore, for my part, I neither agree with <a href=/people/71 target=_blank>Marcellus</a>, who maintains that our college of augurs never was in possession of this science; nor do I agree with <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a>, who asserts that we still preserve it. For that kind of augury which prevailed among our ancestors, I think that it was sometimes used for mere political convenience; but far more often as a bona fide guide and director in critical emergencies. (Quae mihi videtur apud majores fuisse, ut ad Reipublicae tempus nonnunquam, ad agendi consilium saepissime pertineret.) <br />ATTICUS: Well, it might be so, and most probably was so, -- but proceed. <br />MARCUS: I will, and as concisely as possible. What follows relates to the rights of peace and war; in commencing, conducting, and concluding which, justice and good faith are especially necessary. By our law we have therefore appointed the Fetial priests as public interpreters of these rights. <br />As to the religious duties of the Haruspices, concerning expiations and sacrifices, I think I have already said enough. <br />ATTICUS: I think so too, since that branch of the law relates exclusively to religious ceremonials. <br />MARCUS: As to what follows, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, I scarcely know in what terms it becomes me to animadvert, or you to assent. <br />ATTICUS: What is it? <br />MARCUS: The law respecting the nocturnal sacrifices of women. <br />ATTICUS: Oh! I assent to their suppression by all means, excepting those solemn and public sacrifices which your legal maxim permits. <br />MARCUS: But if we suppress the nocturnal sacrifices, what will become of the august mysteries of <a href=/people/1669 target=_blank>Iacchus</a>, and the <a href=/people/1941 target=_blank>Eumolpidae</a>? For we are constructing laws, not for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=ethnic long=12.486 lat=41.891>Romans</a> only, but for all just and valiant nations. <br />ATTICUS: I think it is but courteous to except these mysteries likewise, especially as we ourselves happen to have been initiated in them. <br />MARCUS: With all my heart, let us except them. For it seems to me that among the many admirable and divine things your <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> have established to the advantage of human society, there is nothing better than the mysteries by which we are polished and softened into politeness, from the rude austerities of barbarism. Justly indeed are they called initiations for by them we especially learn the grand principles of philosophic life, and gain, not only the art of living agreeably, but of dying with a better hope. <br />But what displeases me in the nocturnal mysteries, is what the comic poets hold up to ridicule. If such licence was allowed at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, what abominations might be committed by the man who should carry premeditated debauchery into the mysteries, in which even a stolen glance was in ancient times a crime? <br />ATTICUS: Content yourself with proposing this law for <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>: do not rob the Greeks of their customs.</p>                        </div>

It would have been well for many of the Greek cities, if they had maintained the spirited and invigorating character of their ancient music; for since their music has been changed, their morals and manners have lapsed into voluptuousness and effeminacy. Whether their dispositions have been depraved by this seducing and enervating music, or whether their heroism has yielded to the temptation of other vices, certainly both their sense of honour and their sense of hearing must have been corrupt enough ere they could find pleasure in their newfangled concertos.</p>                        </div>

Here are his words on this subject, if I can but interpret them correctly. The earth is consecrated to all the gods, as a grand altar of worship. Therefore private individuals should not consecrate to the gods those territories which belong to them already. As to gold and silver in the cities, whether in houses or sanctuaries, this sort of property may very properly be consecrated. As to ivory, which is extracted from a dead elephant, it is an offering scarcely pure enough for the gods. Bronze and iron, the instruments of war, ought not to be consecrated in sanctuaries. With regard to wood, if any one wishes to dedicate a statute of wood to a divinity, let it be formed from a single tree. The same remark applies to the statues of stone, in common shrines, which should be constructed of one material. As to the dress of a statue, let it not be more elaborate than a woman can make it in a month. Let its colour be white, for this is most pleasing to God, as a general emblem of purity, and peculiary appropriate for sacred vestments. Let there be no colours, therefore, excepting on military decorations. With regard to offerings, the most pleasing ones we can render to the gods are birds, and other simple figures, which a painter may draw in a day; and let the other gifts have the same character of simplicity. <br />Such is the opinion of <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a>.

With relation to our present topic, for instance, what a wonderful cloud of sophistries has been raised by the two Scaevolas, pontiffs both equally skilful in law! Often, says <a href=/people/2779 target=_blank>Publius</a> the son, have I heard from my father, that no one can make a good pontiff, unless he understands the civil law. What, the whole of it? Why so? What in the world has a pontiff to do with the rights of partition walls, aqueducts, etc. Or does he mean only that part of the civil law which is connected with ecclesiastical polity? But how inconsiderable is this, with the exception of certain sacrifices, vows, holidays, burials, and things of that kind. Why then should we make these of so much importance, when the others are so insignificant? <br />Concerning those sacrifices, however, which have a more extensive relation to jurisprudence, we may pronounce this sentence: let them be preserved perpetually, -- and let them pass by succession through families, so that, as I have stated in my maxim, the sacred rites may be constant.</p>                        </div>

On this principle alone, which might suffice for the regulation of all relative cases, have our lawyers raised innumerable quibbles, which fill their books. They demand, forsooth, who are bound to administer these sacred rites? Common justice evidently points out the heir of the deceased; for there is no other person who more appropriately occupies the position of the departed progenitor. Next to the heir, stands the legatee, who by the death of the deceased, or by virtue of his will, sometimes takes as much as all the heirs. All this is implied in the maxim, and perfectly corresponds to its design. Thirdly, if there be no heir, the obligation attaches to him who takes the largest share of the goods of the deceased. Fourthly, if there be no heir or legatee who receives any thing, it binds the chief creditor who gains the largest share of the estate.</p>                        </div>

The civil regulation has less regard to the religious ceremonials than to the rights of sepulchres. A law of the Twelve Tables determines that a dead person shall neither be buried nor burned within the city, I suppose on account of the danger of fire. But the addition of this disjunctive nor burned, indicates, that the corpse which is burned is not so appropriately consigned to burial as to inhumation. <br />ATTICUS: How is it, that notwithstanding this law of the Twelve Tables, so many of our great men have been buried in the city? <br />MARCUS: I believe, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, that this privilege was granted before this law was made, to certain heroic worthies, as <a href=/people/2252 target=_blank>Publicola</a> and <a href=/people/8457 target=_blank>Tubertus</a>, on account of their virtue, and that their descendents have succeeded to this privilege, though it is an exception to the law.

Then followed the festivals, which the relatives attended, crowned with flowers; and in these festivals they pronounced the eulogies on the deceased, if his virtues were worthy of commendation; for it was reckoned impious to lie on such occasions, and thus the ceremony terminated.</p>                        </div>

For as the law is set over the magistrate, even so are the magistrates set over the people. And, therefore, it may be said “that the magistrate is a speaking law, and the law a silent magistrate.” <br />Now it is self-evident, that nothing can be more conformable to justice and natural conscience, which to me appear perfectly congenial, than that legal authority, without which, neither house, nor commonwealth, nor nation, nor mankind itself, nor the entire nature of things in this immeasurable universe, could consist. For this universe is obedient to God, and land and sea are submissive to the universe; and human life depends on the just administration of the laws of order. <br />But to come to considerations nearer home, and more familiar to us, all ancient nations have been under the dominion of kings (omnes antiquae gentes regibus quondam paruerunt). Which kind of authority was at first conferred on the wisest and justest men. And this rule mainly prevailed in our own Commonwealth, as long as the regal power lasted. Afterward, the authority of kings was handed down to their descendants, which remains to this day, in those that reign over nations. And even among those to whom the regal domination was distasteful, though they desired to disclaim their submission to the laws of a monarch, they by no means sought to be emancipated from all laws. <br />For ourselves, then, as we propose laws for a free people, such as we approved in that best kind of Commonwealth, concerning which we wrote our Six Books, we shall now endeavour to accommodate our laws to that constitutional government we there set forth and illustrated.</p>                        </div>

Their lawful authority is therefore to be determined in the legislation of every Commonwealth. But it is not enough to prescribe them a rule of domination, unless we likewise prescribe the citizens a rule of obedience. For in order to command well, we should know how to submit; and he who submits with a good grace will some time become worthy of commanding. It is desirable therefore, that he who obeys may hope that some day he will be capacitated for command, and that he who commands should bear in mind that ere long he may be called to the duty of submission. <br />We would not, however, limit ourselves to requiring from the citizens submission and obedience towards their magistrates; we would also enjoin them by all means to honour and love their rulers, as <a href=/people/1660 target=_blank>Charondas</a> prescribes in his code.

Let some devote their attention to the prison discipline, and capital punishments. Let others supervise the public mintage of gold, and silver, and copper. Let others judge of suits and arbitrations; and let others carry the orders of the senate into execution. <br />Let there likewise be aediles, curators of the city, the provisions, and the public games, and let these offices be the first steps to higher promotions of honour. <br />Let the censors take a census of the people, according to age, race, family, and property.

Indeed, the ancient <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a> were not so deficient in their speculative dissertations respecting politics and laws, as they were in the practical application of them to the service of the people. From the Platonic school, however, the greatest light was cast over politics and laws. Afterwards, <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> illustrated all matters of civil jurisprudence in his elaborate essays, as did also <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Heraclides</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon class=person long=33.5 lat=43.5>Pontus</a>, another of Platoʼs disciples. As for <a href=/people/129 target=_blank>Theophrastus</a>, who was instructed by <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a>, he abounded, as you are aware, in disquisitions of this kind; and <a href=/people/754 target=_blank>Dicaearchus</a>, a disciple of the same master, was by no means deficient in jurisprudential science. After these, <a href=/people/876 target=_blank>Demetrius</a> Phalereus, before mentioned, drew legal learning by his admirable talents from the shades and sequestrations of the schools, into the open daylight of civil life, and gave it a practical point and efficacy, which are of the greatest service in all critical emergencies and conflicts. This combination of legal theory and practice is the more valuable, since we often find that men distinguished in politics are deficient in philosophy, and those celebrated for philosophy are remarkably ignorant in legal affairs. I hardly know where we could find another man of genius, who excels in the theory and practice of jurisprudence, so as to be at once a prince of learning and of political economy.

This monarchical system, I understand, was very agreeable to our ancestors, even after the expulsion of the <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquins</a>. But since the monarchy which was at first preferred was changed, not so much through any fault in the monarchy, as through the vices of a monarch, it should seem, that the monarchy itself should still subsist, if one magistrate commanded all the rest, and nothing but the name of king would be lost.</p>                        </div>

For our consuls are invested with such authority by law, that they command all the other magistrates, except the tribunes, who were created some time after, in order to hinder the abuse of tyranny from being again revived. For the first diminution of the power of the consuls, was the creation of a magistrate who did not hold under them. The next was, when this new magistrate gave his aid not only to other magistrates, but even to private citizens, against any unconstitutional edicts of the consuls. <br />QUINTUS: Ah, my brother, you speak of a great evil; for since the office of the tribunes of the people was established, the authority of the nobles has declined, and the rule of the mob gained strength. <br />MARCUS: The case is not quite so bad as you think, my Quintus. For that consular power when unlimited, would not only appear despotic, but even violent to the people, whereas now by a wise and moderate limitation, it diffuses law and justice to all the citizens. Let us now come to the exposition of our legal maxims, before stated; and to pass over that earlier portion whose propriety is almost self–evident, let us notice that maxim which declares, that soldiers should endeavour to return home with unblemished honour. <br /> For to good and innocent men, no prize so valuable as stainless reputation can be derived either from our enemies or our friends. <br />That maxim is also plainly just, that nothing can be baser than for a man to sue for an appointment as ambassador, for any other interest than that of his country. I speak not merely of the conduct of those who would figure as ambassadors and legates and charges d'affairs in order to sequester estates and inheritances in the provinces; for there exist men by no means unfamiliar with this kind of corruption; but I ask, if any thing can be more scandalous than to see senatorial commissioners without commissions, deputies without instructions, or any public business of a patriotic kind? This sort of legation I should have abolished when consul, with the approbation of a full senate, though apparently against the interest of many nobles, had not a certain blundering tribune of the people opposed me. I succeeded, however, in shortening the term of this official abomination, which was before unlimited, and made such appointments merely annual, and thus this scandal still remains, though it has lost its perpetuity. <br />But now, with your permission, we will wish the provinces good-bye, and once more return to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>. <br />ATTICUS: With all my heart, though such a proposition would appear remarkably disagreeable to many gentlemen in the provinces, I could name if I would.</p>                        </div>

To me it appears extremely mischievous, at once the child and the parent of endless seditions.

By an infernal system of levelling, it reduced the highest dignities to an equality with the meanest degradations, agitating and confounding all things.

In this way, you might show up the consulate itself as a very culpable and objectionable institution, if you choose to reckon up all the sins of all the consuls, which I am willing to pass in silence. Even in this power, I confess there are many stains of abuse; but we can never obtain the good we derive from it without some particles of evil. That the authority of the tribunes of the people is too great, none will deny; but the power of the people themselves is much harsher and crueller. It is by having a leader therefore, such as a tribune, that the people behave more temperately than if they had no leader at all. For a leader remembers that he is advancing at his own risk, whereas the violence of the people has no consciousness of its own danger. Sometimes it is suddenly excited, and sometimes suddenly depressed. But what assembly of tribunes is so insane that not one in ten of its members preserves his senses? As to T. <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a>, you ask, was it not through him that his colleague was dismissed and destroyed? Yes: -- but was not this owing to his excessive ambition. What was his reason for this violence, if it were not to get rid of his colleagueʼs power of opposition? In this matter, however, you observe the wisdom of our ancestors. When this office of tribuneship was granted by the senate to the people, wars ceased, seditions were extinguished, and that wholesome liberty was secured, by which meritorious commoners may expect through their labours to rise into the patrician rank, which is one great principle of political welfare. But there were two <a href=/people/1832 target=_blank>Gracchi</a>. Yes, and as many more as you will -- for though ten tribunes were created, you will find none within our memory very mischievous, though you may discover many who were capricious and immoral.

For it was not the indignant people that wished to injure us, but a pack of miscreants, whom they let out of prison on purpose to attack us, and reprobate slaves, who live on plunder. Besides this, the alarm which the approach of the troops occasioned, aggravated our disaster. And to confess the truth, we had less to struggle against our private enemies, than with the greivous disorders of the state; and if I had not yielded in some measure to the tempest, my country would not now enjoy the perpetual benefit of my services. And this the event testified, -- for what freeman is there, or what bondman worthy of emancipation, to whom our escape is not a subject of congratulation? <br />If I was so unfortunate, that my efforts on behalf of the Commonwealth did not give universal satisfaction -- if the rage of an infuriated mob drove me away by the hurricane of their evil passions; if the tribune <a href=/people/261 target=_blank>Clodius</a> stirred up the populace against me -- as <a href=/people/177 target=_blank>Gracchus</a> against Lenas and <a href=/people/758 target=_blank>Saturninus</a> against <a href=/people/98 target=_blank>Metellus</a>, -- we bore it, my Quintus, with fortitude, and the consolation of an honest heart.

He knew that a certain share of civic authority must needs be granted to the citizens, which, as the people so ardently desired before they attained it, they would be especially loath to relinquish, when once acquired. It was therefore the part of a wise statesman not to refuse a privilege to the people, which was essentially patriotic, and so highly popular that its denial had been dangerous. If these remarks, my Quintus, shall have modified your opinion, tell me so -- for you know, my brother, that in discourses of this kind, an acknowledgement of assent is the very main-spring of the dialogue.

But let us, by all means, hear more of your brotherʼs expositions of the maxims of law. <br />MARCUS: The following maxim allots to all magistrates their auspices and jurisdictions. Their jurisdictions, I say, in such a manner that there should still be a supreme court of justice, to which appeals may be made by the people. And the auspices, because they furnish a plausible method of adjourning useless or mischievous assemblies. For in this way it has often happened that the gods have suppressed by means of auspices the unjust impetuosity of the mob. <br />Another legal maxim is this, -- Let the senate be composed of those who have exercised magistracies. This provision is evidently popular, since it permits none to arrive at high authority without the approbation of the people, leaving the ipse dixit of the censors of little effect. But lest this should seem to favour democratic ascendancy, another provision immediately follows, by which the authority of the senate is confirmed. <br />It is thus expressed: Let the decrees of the senate have the force of laws. For if it so happen that the senate becomes master of public politics, and all men defend its decrees; and if the inferior orders agree that the Commonwealth shall be governed by this superior order, there will arise from this amalgamation of rights, namely, the authority of the senate and the power of the people, the modified and harmonic kind of constitution which I have so highly extolled. <br />This will be especially the case, if the following legal maxim be observed: “Let the senatorial order be free from corruption, and let it be a pattern to others.” <br />QUINTUS: This is an admirable maxim, my brother. It is of the utmost importance that this order be free from corruption; but a censor would have enough to do to enforce such a regulation. <br />ATTICUS: He would indeed, and although the senatorial order is devoted to your interests, my <a href=/people/809 target=_blank>Marcus</a>, and retains a most grateful memorial of your consulship, I would, with your permission, suggest, that not only all censors, but all judges might well grow weary of so painful a task. <br />MARCUS: I am sadly afraid of it, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>; but let us leave this question for the present, for our business is not so much with the senate of today, or our contemporary statesmen, as with future politicians, if any of them shall be complaisant enough to attend to our legal maxims. If such a law were carried, that the senator should be exempt from all corruption, the vicious candidate would not dare to present himself in parliamentary elections. An event, indeed most devoutly to be wished, but most difficultly to be realized, unless perhaps by a certain education and discipline, on which we might speak more at large, if time and occasion permitted.</p>                        </div>

And as to time, the length of this summer holiday will ensure you a hearing. But if you choose to omit this topic now, I shall not forget to demand your views on education and discipline on the first opportunity. <br />MARCUS: I cannot refuse, my <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a>, to grant any request that comes from you. I will therefore enlarge a little on this legal maxim before cited, let the senator be a pattern to others. If this is observed, all will go well. For as a whole city is infected by the licentious passions and vices of great men, so it is often reformed by their virtue and moderation. L. <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>, a man of the first rank, being rallied for the magnificence of his seat at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/418127UTus class=place long=12.7105 lat=41.7983>Tusculum</a>, is said to have made the following extremely suitable answer -- that he had two neighbours, the greater of whom was only a Roman knight, and the other, the son of one who had been once a slave; and as each of them had magnificent villas, that could not be thought extravagance in himself, a consul, which was lawful for those of inferior rank. Alas! <a href=/people/87 target=_blank>Lucullus</a>; you little thought that it was you that gave rise to their ambition. Were it not for your example, such an action in them would have been looked on as criminal. Who could bear that people of this sort should have their villas crowded with statues and pictures, relating either to public, or what is more, to sacred and religious subjects? Who would not join in demolishing the monuments of their vanity and pride, if those who ought to exert themselves on such occasions were not guilty of the same extravagance? For the mischief immediately attending the vices of the great, though that must be allowed to be very considerable, is but small compared with the ill consequences which arise from the multitude of those who will certainly follow their example. <br />Would you but look into the history of former ages, you might plainly see that the manners of the people were always regulated by those of the leading men of a state; and that whatever change took place in the latter, the same always happened in the former.</p>                        </div>

Hence, great men of a vicious life are doubly pernicious to the state, as being not only guilty of immoral practices themselves, but likewise of spreading them far and wide among their fellow-citizens. The mischief they do, is owing not only to their being debauched themselves, but also to their debauching a crowd of their foolish imitators. In a word, they do more harm by their example than by the crimes they commit. <br />This maxim, though we would wish to extend its influence to the whole body of senators, would be of great service, even if it were observed by a few of them. For even a few noblemen, aye, even a very few, illustrious in fame and fortune, may correct the morals or manners of the state, or cast them into grievous corruptions.

It is often hurtful to the state, when a regulation is said to be true and proper in itself, but at the same time, that it cannot be obtained, because it cannot be carried without opposing the people. Now, I say, the people are to be opposed whenever they act amiss, and it is better for patriotic lawyers to suffer in a good cause, than yield to a bad one. Now, who does not perceive that all authority is taken away from our nobility and gentry by the present Roman law of balloting (Quis autem non sensit auctoritatem omnem optimatium tabellariam legem abstulisse). A law which the people, when free, never desired, but which they claimed when oppressed by the domination and power of certain aristocrats. It is no wonder, therefore, that the system of open polling and viva voce votes, presents us with more severe judgments against the grandees, than the present plan of ballots. Therefore it had been far better te restrain the excessive influence of the great for unjustifiable objects in elective suffrages, than to give the people a mask and veil, by which they may keep the more honourable citizens in ignorance of their individual sentiments, and thus make the ballot a mere cover for corrupt and hypocritical votes. (Quamobrem suffragandi nimia libido in non bonis causis eripienda fuit potentibus, non latebra dando populo in quâ bonis ignorantibus quid quisque sentiret tabella vitiorum occultaret suffragium.) <br />For this reason, it is that no good man was ever a proposer or supporter of the system of ballotting. (Itaque isti rationi neque lator quisquam est inventus neque auctor unquam bonus). <br />There are four laws of ballots: the first, concerning the election of magistrates, was proposed by a certain <a href=/people/510 target=_blank>Gabinius</a>, an unknown and sordid agitator. The second, respecting the adjudications of the people, was proposed two years afterwards by <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a>, who was a nobleman, -- but with his familyʼs permission, I venture to say, a nobleman opposed to all goodness, driven to and fro by the idlest rumours of the populace. The third, regarding the ratification or nullification of laws, was carried by <a href=/people/669 target=_blank>Carbo</a>, a seditious and profligate citizen, whose return to the better classes of society never secured him the approbation of the aristocracy.</p>                        </div>

I conceive you are entitled to take higher ground; for in your treatise on the Commonwealth, your <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> does not hesitate to condemn the law of <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> as injudicious, whoever was its author. If you take away the law of ballot you will do still better. For in truth I donʼt like it at all, nor does our friend <a href=/people/405 target=_blank>Atticus</a> much admire it, if I may judge by his countenance. <br />ATTICUS: For me, I never admired any thing that pleases the mob, and I regard the best state of the Commonwealth, to be that which your brother, when consul, promoted, wherein the power of the aristocracy prevailed over that of the populace. (Mihi vero nihi lun quam populare placuit, eamque optimam Rempublicam esse duco, quam hic consul constituerat quae sit in potestate optimorum. <br />MARCUS: I see, gentlemen, you would repeal my law respecting suffrages, without any ballot whatsoever. For myself, though I have sufficiently justified in my Commonwealth the line of conduct assumed by <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, yet I would not practically go quite so far as he. <br />It is only under the authority of the nobles, which good men will obey, that I concede the right of voting to the people. For these are the very words of my law respecting elections. Let the votes be notorious to the nobles, and free to the people. (Optimatibus nota plebi libera sunto). Which legal maxim contains this doctrine, that all those laws should be abrogated which have been so contrived as in any way to mask or hide a suffrage; such as those which hinder full inspection of any ballot, or examination and appeal thereupon, and that law of <a href=/people/50 target=_blank>Marius</a>, which makes the passages to the balloting boxes so narrow, should be likewise abolished. (Quae lex hanc sententiam continet ut omnes leges tollat quae postea latae sunt, quæ tegunt omni ratione suffragium ne quis inspiciat tabellam ne roget ne appellat. Pontes lex maria fecit angustos). <br />If these rules are opposed, as they generally are, to the ambitious, they are worthy our approval. If the laws indeed could but hinder intrigues, then the people might be allowed the ballot as a vindicator of liberty, provided it were so laid open and freely exposed to all honourable and worthy citizens, that their authority might be blended with this popular privilege, thus leaving the people the power of expressing their deference for the aristocracy. <br />But why is it, Quintus, as you just now observed, that there were more condemnations past by the open suffrages of the poll, than by the silent secret votes of the ballot? We should explain the anomoly thus. The people are extremely fond of licence; do but save appearances in this respect, and they will abandon their influence to authority or favour. As to the largesses and bribes which are given to obtain corrupt suffrages, do you not see if we could but get rid of bribery, the characters and counsels of the best men would carry the votes? By our legal maxim, therefore, the appearance of liberty is conceded, but as the superintendence of the aristocracy is still retained, the cause of contention is banished.</p>                        </div>

Every mob orator, modifies and moulds not merely the opinions and desires, but the very features of his audience. It is not so in the senate, however; for the senator should not permit himself to imitate the fashion of the mob orator, but will rather endeavour to speak with absolute decorum and propriety. <br />We therefore require three duties from the senator. First, that his attendance in the senate be regular; for the multitude of senators lends weight to the arguments of policy. -- Secondly, that he should speak in his turn, that is, when his counsel is demanded. Thirdly. -- That he should speak concisely, lest he should become infinitely wearisome; for brevity in parliamentary oratory, and all kinds of oratory, is the best recommendation of a speech. <br />Lengthy speeches therefore are never seasonable, except when the senate is precipitating some rash measure, as it does far too often, through the ambition and corruption of its members. In such a case, it may be desirable for a speaker, not being duly seconded by another representative, to occupy a whole day. The same privilege may be allowed where the subject of debate is so important as to demand all the copiousness of the orator, both hortatory and explanatory, in which our own <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> is remarkably distinguished.</p>                        </div>

For it is necessary for a senator to be acquainted with politics in general, and this is a science of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth; since it comprehends its military affairs, its commercial statistics and revenue, its foreign alliances, its colonies and stipendiaries. He should be familiar with their regulations, their resources, and their engagements; their customs and modes of life. You therefore see that the science of politics taxes every power of intellect and memory, in order to acquire and maintain that elaborate information, without which no one can be called an accomplished senator. <br />Then follows a legal maxim, which relates to the public deliberations of the people, in which it is especially enjoined hat all violence be avoided (vis abesto). For nothing is more destructive in states, nothing more contrary to law and right, nothing less civil and humane, than to carry any thing by violence and agitation in a sound and constitutional government. <br />The next maxim relates to the office of comptrollers, -- which is an admirable institution, since it is better that a good measure be sometimes impeded than a bad one carried. <br />When I say, in all cases of fraud, it is necessary to go before a pleader, I follow the opinion of <a href=/people/95 target=_blank>Crassus</a>, one of our wisest men, whose counsel was adopted by the senate, which decreed when the consul <a href=/people/82 target=_blank>Claudius</a> reported Carboʼs sedition, that they could not take cognizance of sedition, except through the medium of an official pleader, who should lay the case before the people. Since it was allowable for him who made a proposition to abandon it as soon as it began to occasion disturbance; and if he persisted, when he could do no good, he would be held accessory to a breach of the peace, which we would punish severely. <br />Then follows that maxim, which states, that he who acts as a comptroller of civil abuses, shall be considered as a good citizen. And who would not promote the interests of the Commonwealth, with all his energy, when stimulated by the hope of acquiring a character so glorious? <br />Next, succeed certain regulations, which we likewise find in the public institutions and laws -- that auspices be observed, and augurs obeyed. It is the duty of a good augur to show himself in the critical periods of the Commonwealth, as Jupiterʼs minister and prophet; since those to whom he has entrusted the auspices are his instruments of revelation; and he has revealed his celestial influences to them, in order that they may succour the state in her hour of danger and necessity. <br />Then follows a provision respecting the promulgation of laws, that they ought to be proposed distinctly in their successive counts and clauses, and that the remonstrances and objections not of the magistrates only, but of private individuals, should be duly weighed. <br />After this, we find two excellent laws selected from the Twelve Tables. One of these forbids unfair privileges and partialities: the other will not permit sentence of death to he past on any citizen except in the high courts of justice. You may think it odd that such decisions were not left to seditious tribunes of the people; but our ancestors provided for posterity, that laws should not be enacted in favour of particular individuals, for that is what we call privilege than which nothing can be more inequitable. Since it is most important that every law should be equally published and enjoined to all, they refused to sanction any particular enactments which were not openly proposed in the assembled commons, (centuriatis comitiis). For when the people are summoned by rank, order, and age, they use much more consideration in giving their suffrages, than when they are promiscuously convoked by tribes.</p>                        </div>

But it appeared to you and other illustrious men more proper, seeing these slaves and vagabonds persisted in declaring they had justly condemned me, to manifest as openly as possible what all <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> thought on the subject. <br />Next follow those laws which relate to pecuniary bribes and intrigues. And since these cannot be so well chastised by censures as by penalties, it is added, let all such abuses be visited with penalty and punishment, so that every one be duly punished for this disgraceful corruption: the avaricious by fines, and the ambitious by ignominy. <br />The last laws we have cited, are not in use among us, though very necessary to the state. We have no proper registration of laws (custodiam legum). Our laws, therefore, are such as the apparitors declare them to be, and we are forced to take the word of their copyists as our security. We want some public legal registry, in which our laws may lie open to the notice of the people. The Greeks are more careful than ourselves in this matter, as they have instituted legal registrars, whom they call nomophylaces. Their office is not only to preserve the original copies of the laws, as was the custom among our ancestors, but also to summon back to the law, observing the conduct of the citizens.</p>                        </div>

It is likewise to the censors, according to our legal maxim, that those who retire from magisterial offices should unfold and explain their proceedings when in office, in order to enable the censors to report them fairly. <br />There existed a very similar institution in Greece, where public examiners were directed to inspect official accounts. But these examiners could never have much weight unless their functions were voluntary and honorary. It is therefore better to state the case, and explain the accounts to the censors. And in case of error, leave the whole suit to the law, the plaintiff, and the judge. <br />But I presume we have sufficiently discussed the offices and duties of magistrates, unless you demand further information on any point. <br />ATTICUS: Why -- if we held our peace, the very subject itself would admonish you what you ought further to say.</p>                        </div>
