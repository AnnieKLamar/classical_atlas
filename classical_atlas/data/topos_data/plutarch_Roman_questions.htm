Solution: Is it not for one of these reasons; amongst elements and principles, one is masculine and the other feminine; — one (fire) hath in it the principles of motion, the other (water) hath the faculty of a subject and matter? Or is it because fire refines and water cleanseth, and a married wife ought to continue pure and chaste? Or is it because fire without moisture doth not nourish, but is adust, and water destitute of heat is barren and sluggish; so both the male and female apart are of no force, but a conjunction of both in marriage completes society? Or is the meaning that they must never forsake each other, but must communicate in every fortune, and although there be no goods, yet they may participate with each other in fire and water? </p>                        </div>

Solution: Whether it be (as <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> saith) that the Praetors use three, but more are permitted to the Aediles, and married persons do light the fire at the Aediles' torches? Or is it that, having use of many numbers, the odd number was reckoned better and perfecter upon other accounts, and therefore more adapted to matrimony? For the even number admits of division, and the equal parts of opposition and repugnancy, whenas the odd cannot be divided, but being divided into parts leaves always an inequality. The number five is most matrimonial of odd numbers, for three is the first odd and two is the first even, of which five is compounded, as of male and female. because light is a sign of generation, and it is natural to a woman, for the most part, to bring forth so far as five successively, and therefore they use five torches? Or is it because they suppose that married persons have occasion for five Gods, <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> Teleios, <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a> Teleia, <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, Peitho (Persuasion), and above all the rest <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, whom women invocate in their travail and child-bed sickness? </p>                        </div>

This man came to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, with an intention to sacrifice his <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> there; but a servant acquainted King <a href=/people/308 target=_blank>Servius</a> privately with this prophecy, and the king making it known to <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> the priest, <a href=/people/89 target=_blank>Cornelius</a> strictly commanded <a href=/people/5439 target=_blank>Antro</a> to wash in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125WTib class=place long=12.4755 lat=41.8835>Tiber</a> before he sacrificed, for the law equires men so to do who would sacrifice acceptably.

Solution: Verily the account which <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> gives of this matter is altogether fabulous. For he saith, in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=demonym long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicilian</a> war, when there was a great naval fight, and a very false report was rumored concerning many as if they were slain, all of them returning home in a little time died. But as one of them was going to enter in at his doors, they shut together against him of their own accord, neither could they be opened by any that attempted it. This man, falling in a sleep before the doors, saw an apparition in his sleep advising him to let himself down from the roof into the house, and doing so, he lived happily and became an old man; and hence the custom was confirmed to after ages. But consider if these things be not conformable to some usages of the Greeks. For they do not esteem those pure nor keep them company nor suffer them to approach their sacrifices, for whom any funeral was carried forth or sepulchre made as if they were dead; and they say that <a href=/people/7297 target=_blank>Aristinus</a>, being one that was become an object of this sort of superstition, sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphi</a> to beg and beseech of the God a resolution of the anxieties and troubles which he had by reason of the custom then in force. <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=place long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Pythia</a> answered thus: The sacred rites t' which child-bed folks conform, See that thou do to blessed Gods perform. <a href=/people/7297 target=_blank>Aristinus</a>, well understanding the meaning of the oracle, puts himself into the women's hands, to be washed and wrapped in swaddling clouts, and sucks the breasts, in the same manner as when he was newly born; and thus all others do, and such are called Hysteropotmi (i.e. those for whom a funeral was made while living). But some say that these ceremonies were before <a href=/people/7297 target=_blank>Aristinus</a>, and that the custom was ancient. Wherefore it is not to be wondered at, if the Romans, when once they suppose a man buried and to have his lot among the dead, do not think it lawful for him to go in at the door whereat they that are about to sacrifice do go out or those that have sacrificed do enter in, but bid them ascend aloft into the air, and thence descend into the open court of the house. For they constantly offer their sacrifices of purification in this open court. </p>                        </div>

Solution: What if it should be (as many suppose) that women were forbid to drink wine; therefore that those that drank it might not be undiscovered, but convicted when they met with their acquaintance, kissing became a custom? Or is it for the reason which <a href=/people/46 target=_blank>Aristotle</a> the philosopher hath told us? Even that thing which was commonly reported and said to be done in many places, it seems, was enterprised by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=demonym long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Trojan</a> women in the confines of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>. For after the men arrived and went ashore, the women set the ships on fire, earnestly longing to be discharged of their roving and seafaring condition; but dreading their husbands' displeasure, they fell on saluting their kindred and acquaintance that met them, by kissing and embracing; whereupon the husbands' anger being appeased and they reconciled, they used for the future this kind of compliment towards them. Or rather might this usage be granted to women as a thing that gained them reputation and interest, if they appeared hereby to have many and good kindred and acquaintance? Or was it that, it being unlawful to marry kinswomen, a courteous behavior might proceed so far as a kiss, and this was retained only as a significant sign of kindred and a note of a familiar converse among them? For in former time they did not marry women nigh by blood, — as now they marry not aunts or sisters, — but of late they allowed the marrying of cousins for the following reason. A certain man, mean in estate, but on the other hand an honest and a popular man among the citizens, designed to marry his cousin being an heiress, and to get an estate by her. Upon this account he was accused; but the people took little notice of the accusation, and absolved him of the fault, enacting by vote that it might be lawful for any man to marry so far as cousins, but prohibited it to all higher degrees of consanguinity. </p>                        </div>

Solution: What if the reason be as <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> writes it, — describing gifts to be peculiar to dying persons, unless a man being entangled by necessity or wheedled by a woman be enslaved to force which constrains him, or to pleasure which persuades him, — that thus the gifts of husbands and wives became suspected? Or is it that they reputed a gift the basest sign of benevolence (for strangers and they that have no love for us do give us presents), and so took away such a piece of flattery from marriage, that to love and be beloved should be devoid of mercenariness, should be spontaneous and for its own sake, and not for any thing else? Or because women, being corrupted by receiving gifts, are thereby especially brought to admit strangers, did it seem to be a weighty thing to require them to love their own husbands that give them nothing? Or was it because all things ought to be common between them, the husbands' goods being the wives', and the wives' goods the husbands'? For he that accepts that which is given learns thereby to esteem that which is not given the property of another; so that, by giving but a little to each other, they strip each other of all. </p>                        </div>

Solution: The latter part of the question seems to augment the difficulty of the former. If now the story told of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a> be true, that whilst <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomedes</a> was passing by he offered a sacrifice with his head covered, it is rational and consequent that, while we cover our heads before our enemies, when we meet our friends and good men we should be uncovered. This behavior before the Gods therefore is not their peculiar right, but accidental, continuing to be observed since that example of <a href=/people/37 target=_blank>Aeneas</a>. If there is any thing further to be said, consider whether we ought not to enquire only after the reason why men in divine service are covered, the other being the consequence of it. For they that are uncovered before men of greater power do not thereby ascribe honor unto them, but rather remove envy from them, that they might not seem to demand or to endure the same kind of reverence which the Gods have, or to rejoice that they are served in the same manner as they. But they worship the Gods in this manner, either showing their unworthiness in all humility by the covering of the head, or rather fearing that some unlucky and ominous voice should come to them from abroad whilst they are praying; therefore they pluck up their cloaks about their ears. That they strictly observed these things is manifest in this, that when they went to consult the oracle, they made a great din all about by the tinkling of brass kettles. Or is it as <a href=/people/230 target=_blank>Castor</a> saith, that the Roman usages were conformable to the Pythagoric notion that the daemon within us stands in need of the Gods without us, and we make supplication to them with a covered head, intimating the body's hiding and absconding of the soul? </p>                        </div>

Or is it that what is not the fashion is fit for mourning? For it is more customary for women to appear publicly with covered heads, and for men with uncovered. Yea, among the Greeks, when any sad calamity befalls them, the women are polled close but the men wear their hair long, because the usual fashion for men is to be polled and for women to wear their hair long.

Solution: Anciently March was reckoned the first, as is plain by many other marks and especially by this, that the fifth month from March was called <a href=/people/4286 target=_blank>Quintilis</a>, and the sixth <a href=/people/5250 target=_blank>Sextilis</a>, and so forward to the last. December was so called, being reckoned the tenth from March; hence it came to pass that some are of opinion and do affirm that the Romans formerly did not complete the year with twelve months, but with ten only, allotting to some of the months above thirty days. But others give us an account that, as December is the tenth from March, January is the eleventh and February the twelfth; in which month they use purifications, and perform funeral rites for the deceased upon the finishing of the year; but this order of the months being changed, they now make January the first, because on the first day of this month (which day they call the Kalends of January) the first consuls were constituted, the kings being deposed. But some speak with a greater probability, which say that <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, being a warlike and martial man and reputing himself the son of <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, set March in the front of all the months, and named it from <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>; but <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> again, being a peaceable prince and ambitious to bring off the citizens from warlike achievements, set them upon husbandry, gave the pre-eminence to January, and brought <a href=/people/983 target=_blank>Janus</a> into a great reputation, as he was more addicted to civil government and husbandry than to warlike affairs. Now consider whether <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> hath not pitched upon a beginning of the year most suitable to our natural disposition. For there is nothing at all in the whole circumvolution of things naturally first or last, but by law or custom some appoint one beginning of time, some another; but they do best who take this beginning from after the winter solstice, when the sun, ceasing to make any further progress, returns and converts his course again to us. For there is then a kind of tropic in nature itself, which verily increaseth the time of light to us and shortens the time of darkness, and makes the Lord and Ruler of the whole current of nature to approach nearer to us. </p>                        </div>

Or is it this, that, as they abstain from many things, so especially they reserve themselves chaste from all things that appertain to venery when they perform that divine service; for they do not only turn their husbands out of doors but banish from the house every male kind, when they exercise this canonical obedience to their Goddess. They therefore reject myrtle as an abomination, it being consecrated to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>; and the <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a> whom at this day they call <a href=/people/5807 target=_blank>Murcia</a> they anciently called <a href=/people/9847 target=_blank>Myrtia</a>, as it would seem. </p>                        </div>

Or rather that they who define time by the variations of the moon have observed that the moon comes under three greatest variations monthly; the first is when it is obscured, making a conjunction with the sun; the second is when it gets out of the rays of the sun and makes her first appearance after the sun is down; the third is at her fulness, when it is full moon. They call her disappearance and obscurity the Kalends, for every thing hid and privy they call clam, and celare is to hide. The first appearance they call the Nones, by a most fit notation of names, it being the new moon (novilunium); for they call it new moon as we do. Ides are so called either by reason of the fairness and clear form (εἰδος) of the moon standing forth in her complete splendor, or from the name of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> (Διός).

Solution: Was it (as most men think, and <a href=/people/1839 target=_blank>Livy</a> tells us) because on the next day after the Ides of <a href=/people/4286 target=_blank>Quintilis</a> (which they now call July), the tribunes of the soldiery marching forth, the army was conquered by the Gauls in a battle about the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420125WAli class=place long=12.5207 lat=42.0177>Allia</a> and lost the city, whereupon this day was reckoned unlucky; and superstition (as it loves to do) extended this observation further, and subjected the next days after the Nones and Kalends to the same scrupulosity? Or what if this notion meet with much contradiction? For it was on another day they were defeated in battle, which they call Alliensis (from the river) and greatly abominate as unsuccessful; and whereas there be many unlucky days, they do not observe them in all the months alike, but every one in the month it happens in, and it is most improbable that all the next days after the Nones and Kalends simply considered should contract this superstition. Consider now whether — as they consecrated the first of the months to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> Gods, and the second to the chthonian, wherein they solemnize some purifications and funeral rites to the ghosts of the deceased — they have so constituted the three which have been spoken of, as it were, the chief and principal days for festival and holy days, designating the next following these to daemons and deceased persons, which days they esteemed unfortunate and unfit for action. And also the Grecians, worshipping their Gods at the new of the moon, dedicated the next day to heroes and daemons, and the second of the cups was mingled on the behalf of the male and female heroes. Moreover, time is altogether a number; and unity, which is the foundation of a number, is of a divine nature. The number next is two, opposite to the first, and is the first of even numbers. But an even number is defective, imperfect, and indefinite; as again an odd number is determinate, definite, and complete. Therefore the Nones succeed the Kalends on the fifth day, the Ides follow the Nones on the ninth, for odd numbers do determine the beginnings. But those even numbers which are next after the beginnings have not that pre-eminence nor influence; hence on such days they take not any actions or journey in hand. Wherefore that of <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> hath reason in it. The Day after the feast contended with the Feast-day, saying that the Feast-day had much labor and toil, but she (the Day after the feast) afforded the fruition of the provision made for the Feast-day, with much leisure and quietness. The Feast-day answered after this wise: Thou speakest truth; but if I had not been, neither hadst thou been. These things spake <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistocles</a> to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> generals who succeeded him, signifying that they could never have made any figure in the world had not he saved the city. Since therefore every action and journey worth our diligent management requires necessary provision and preparation, but the Romans of old made no family provision on feast-days, nor were careful for any thing but that they might attend divine service, — and this they did with all their might, as even now the priests enjoin them in their proclamations when they proceed to the sacrifices, — in like manner they did not rush presently after their festival solemnities upon a journey or any enterprise (because they were unprovided), but finished that day in contriving domestic affairs and fitting themselves for the intended occasion abroad. And as even at this day, after they have said their prayers and finished their devotion, they are wont to stay and sit still in the sanctuaries, so they did not join working days immediately to holy days, but made some interval and distance between them, secular affairs bringing many troubles and distractions along with them. </p>                        </div>

Verily <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> is the father, and that which is abroad in the open air may be especially said to be as it were in the sight of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>.

For each of these has its season. After the same manner (as it appears) among the Romans it is peculiar to the priest neither to make use of a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, nor to be absent from home in a journey more than three nights, nor to put off his cap, on which account he is called Flamen. Many other things are enjoined to all sorts of men by the priest; of which one is not to be anointed abroad in the open air. For the Romans have a great prejudice against dry unction; and they are of opinion that nothing hath been so great a cause to the Grecians of slavery and effeminancy as their fencing and wrestling schools, insinuating so much debauchery and idleness into the citizens, yea, vicious sloth and buggery; yea, that they destroyed the very bodies of youths with sleeping, perambulations, dancing, and delicious feeding, whereby they insensibly fell from the use of arms, and instead of being good soldiers and horsemen, loved to be called nimble, good wrestlers, and pretty men.

Or is it that this is a Greek name, as many others of them are, and signifies a Goddess that always oversees and inspects affairs; and that therefore she has her temple always open, as one that never slumbers nor sleeps? But if <a href=/people/822 target=_blank>Labeo</a> deduceth Hora aright from hortari, consider whether orator may not rather be said to be derived from thence, — since the orator, being an exhorting and exciting person, is a counsellor or leader of the people, — and not from imprecation and prayer (orando), as some say. </p>                        </div>

Or is it because his wife joins with the husband in consecration (as there are many sacred rites that ought not to be performed unless the wife be present), but to marry another immediately after he hath lost the former wife is not perhaps easy to do, and besides is not convenient? Hence it was not lawful formerly to put away a wife, nor is it at this present lawful; except that <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a> in our remembrance, being petitioned, granted it.

Solution: Is it for the reason here rehearsed? This sort of men (as it seems) had great privileges accruing to them from the grant of King <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a>, by reason of his godly devotion; which things afterward being taken from them when the Decemviri managed the government, they forsook the city. Whereupon there was a search made for them, and one of the priests, offering sacrifice without music, made a superstitious scruple of so doing. And when they returned not upon invitation, but led their lives in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>, a certain freedman told the magistrates privately that he would undertake to bring them. And providing a plentiful feast, as if he had sacrificed to the Gods, he invited the minstrels; women-kind was present also, with whom they revelled all night, sporting and dancing. There on a sudden the man began a speech, and being surprised with a fright, as if his patron had come in upon him, persuaded the pipers to ascend the caravans that were covered all over with skins, saying he would carry them back to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/420128UTib class=place long=12.7975 lat=41.9644>Tibur</a>.

Most of them, by reason of the night-revel and the drink that they were in, happened to be clothed in flowered women's robes; whereupon, being prevailed upon by the magistrates and reconciled, it was decreed that they should go up and down the city on that day, habited after this manner. </p>                        </div>

Hence there is a certain sacrifice kept by tradition in the market-place near the Comitia, which as soon as the king (i.e. the chief priest) hath offered, he immediately withdraws himself by flight out of the market-place. </p>                        </div>

Solution: What if the tribune is not a magistrate at all? For he neither hath lictors, nor sitting in tribunal doth he determine causes; neither do the tribunes, as the rest, enter upon their office at the beginning of the year, nor do they cease when a dictator is chosen; but as if they translated all magistratic power to themselves, they continue still, being (as it were) no magistrates, but holding another kind of rank. And as some rhetoricians will not have a prohibition to be judicial proceeding, seeing it doth something contrary to judicial proceeding, — for the one brings in an action at law and gives judgment upon it, but the other nonsuits it and dismisseth the cause, — after the like manner they are of opinion that tribuneship is rather a curb to magistracy, and that it is an order standing in opposition to government rather than a piece of government itself; for the tribune's office and authority is to withstand the magistrate's authority, even to curtail his extravagant power. Perhaps these and similar reasons may be mere ingenious devices; but in truth, since tribuneship takes its original from the people, popularity is its stronghold, and it is a great thing not to carry it above the rest of the people, but to be like the citizens they have to do with in gesture, habit, and diet. State indeed becomes a consul and a praetor; but as for a tribune (as Caius <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> saith), he must be one that even is trampled upon, not grave in countenance, nor difficult of access, nor harsh to the rabble, but more tractable to them than to others. Hence it was decreed that the tribune's doors should not be shut, but be open night and day as a haven and place of refuge for distressed people. And the more condescending his outward deportment is, by so much the more doth he increase in his power; for they dignify him as one of public use, and to be resorted to of all sorts even as an altar; therefore by the reverence they give him, he is sacred, holy, and inviolable; and when he makes a public progress, it is a law that every one should cleanse and purify the body as defiled. </p>                        </div>

For it seems absurd to do this themselves, and yet to reprimand the barbarians as if they were committing profaneness. Solution: What if this be the reason, that they reckoned it profane to sacrifice a man to the Gods, but necessary to do so to the Daemons? Or were they of opinion that they sinned that did such things by custom or law; but as for themselves, they did it being enjoined to it by the <a href=/people/12187 target=_blank>Sibylline books</a>?

And when the diviners declared that it was an intolerable disgrace to the holy virgins that it should be published, and that some part of the abuse did touch the cavaliers, a servant of a certain barbarian cavalier informed, that three <a href=/people/12228 target=_blank>vestal virgins</a>, <a href=/people/2704 target=_blank>Aemilia</a>, <a href=/people/3035 target=_blank>Licinia</a>, and Martia, about the same time had been deflowered, and for a long time played the whores with some men, among whom was Butetius, the said informer's master.

Solution: Is the reason that the commonweal had a military constitution at the first? For many matters of concern on military expeditions are managed by night. Or did they make sunrising the beginning of business, and the night the preparation for it? For men ought to come prepared to action, and not to be in preparation when they should be doing, — as Myso is reported to have said to <a href=/people/1554 target=_blank>Chilo</a> the Wise, when he was making a fan in winter. Or as the noontide to many is the time for finishing public and weighty affairs, so did it seem meet to make midnight the beginning? This hath this confirmation, that a Roman governor would make no league or confederation in the afternoon. Or is it impossible to take the beginning and end of the day from sunrising to sunsetting? For, as the vulgar measure the beginning of the day by sense to be the first appearance of the sun, and take the first beginning of the night to be the complete withdrawment of the sun from sight, we shall thus have no equinoctial day; but the night which we suppose comes nearest in equality to the day will be manifestly shorter than the day by the diameter of the sun. Which absurdity the mathematicians, going about to solve, have determined that, where the centre of the sun toucheth the horizon, there is the true parting point between day and night. But this contradicts sense; for it must follow that whilst there is much light above the earth, yea, the sun illuminating us, we will not for all this confess it to be day, but must say that it is still night. Whereas then it is hard to take the beginning of the day from the rising and setting of the sun, by reason of the forementioned absurdities, it remains to take the zenith and the nadir for the beginning. The last is best, for the sun's course from noon is by way of declination from us; but from midnight he takes his course towards us, as sunrising comes on. </p>                        </div>

Solution: Perhaps it's a natural reason, that girls are forwarder, for the female grows up and comes to full stature and perfection before the male. But they take the day after the seventh, because the seventh is dangerous to infants by reason of the navel-string; for with many it falls off at seven days, and until it falls off, an infant is more like a plant than an animal. Or is it, as the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> reckon, that the even number is the feminine, and the odd number the masculine? For it is a fruitful number, and excels the even in respect of its composition. And if these numbers be divided into units, the even, like a female, hath an empty space in the middle; the odd number always leaves a segment full in the middle, wherefore this is fit to be compared to the male, that to the female. Or is it thus, that of all numbers nine is the first square number made of three, which is an odd and perfect number, but eight is the first cube made of two, an even number; whence a male ought to be square, superexcelling, and complete; but a woman, like a cube, constant, a good housewife, and no gadding gossip? This also may be added that, as eight is a cube from the root two, and nine a square from the root three, so the female makes use of two names, and the males of three. </p>                        </div>

Or do they suspect that the contentions that would happen among relations upon marriage would destroy even natural rights?

Solution: Is it because meal is imperfect and crude nourishment? For the wheat neither hath continued what it was, neither is it made into bread as it must be; but it hath lost the faculty of seed, and hath not attained to usefulness for food. Wherefore the poet hath named meal, by a metaphor, mill-murdered (μυλήφατον), as if the corn were spoiled and destroyed by grinding. Leaven, as it is made by corruption, corrupts the mass that it is mingled with, for it is made thereby looser and weaker; and fermentation is a kind of corruption, which, if it be overmuch, makes the bread sour and spoils it. </p>                        </div>

Or is it that the same reason that makes them averse to meal doth also make them averse to flesh; for it is neither a living creature nor dressed food? Roasting or boiling, being an alteration and change, doth change its form; but fresh and raw flesh offers not a pure and unpolluted object to the eye, but such as is offensive to the eye, and like that of a raw wound. </p>                        </div>

Solution: Was it that they abominated the lasciviousness and stink of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>, or that they suspected it to be a diseased creature? For it seems this animal is more seized with the falling sickness than other creatures, and is contagious to them that eat or touch it while it hath this disease; they say, the cause is the straightness of the windpipe, often intercepting the breath, a sign of which they make the smallness of their voice to be; for it happens to men that are epileptical, that they utter a voice sounding much like the bleat of a <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goat</a>. Now in a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> there may be less of lasciviousness and of an ill scent; although some say that <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> are not permitted to go into the high streets of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> — no, not into the island <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374253PDel class=place long=25.267 lat=37.398>Delos</a> — by reason of their open coition; as if <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>kine</a>, <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>swine</a>, and <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> did use coition in bed-chambers, and not openly and lawlessly. They do not know the true reason, — that, because a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> is a quarrelsome creature, they therefore expel <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dogs</a> out of sanctuaries and sacred temples, giving safe access to suppliants for refuge. Wherefore it is very likely that the priest of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, being (as it were) an animated and sacred image, granted for refuge to petitioners and suppliants, doth banish or fright away none. For which cause a couch was set for him in the porch of the house, and they that fell on their knees before him had indemnity from stripes or punishment that day; and if one in fetters came and addressed him, he was unloosed, and his fetters were not laid down by the door but thrown from the roof. It would be therefore no advantage that he should carry himself so mild and courteous, if there were a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> at the door, scaring and frighting them that petitioned for sanctuary. Neither did the ancients at all repute this creature clean; for he is offered in sacrifice to none of the celestial Gods, but being sent to <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>, an infernal Goddess, at the three cross-ways for a supper, takes a share in averting calamities and in expiations. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=place long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemon</a> they cut <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>puppies</a> in pieces to <a href=/people/24 target=_blank>Mars</a>, that most cruel God. In <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi class=place long=23.25 lat=38.35>Boeotia</a> public expiation is made by passing between the parts of a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> divided in twain. But the Romans sacrifice a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> in the cleansing month, on the festival which they call <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Lupercalia</a>. Hence it was not without cause, to prohibit them whose charge it was to worship the highest and holiest God from making a <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>dog</a> familiar and customed to them. </p>                        </div>

Solution: Is it not of the like nature with those precepts of <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a>, not to eat in a chair, not to sit upon a measure called a choenix, and not to step over a broom? For the <a href=/people/135 target=_blank>Pythagoreans</a> do not dread and refrain from these things, but they prohibit other things by these. Now to go under a vine hath reference to wine, because it is not lawful for a priest to be drunk. For the wine is above the heads of those that are drunk, and they are depraved and debased thereby; whereas it is requisite that they should be above pleasure and conquer it, but not be subdued by it. As for the ivy, — it being unfruitful and useless to men, as also infirm, and by reason of its infirmity standing in need of other trees to climb upon, though by its shadow and sight of its greenness it doth bewitch the vulgar, — what if they judge it not convenient to nourish it about a house because it bringeth no profit, or to suffer it to clasp about any thing, seeing it is so hurtful to plants that bear it up, while it sticketh fast in the ground? Hence ivy is forbidden at the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly class=demonym long=21.63 lat=37.6378>Olympic</a> festivals, and neither at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a> in <a href=/people/19 target=_blank>Hera</a>'s sacrifices, nor at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe class=place long=23.3178 lat=38.3191>Thebes</a> in those belonging to <a href=/people/15 target=_blank>Aphrodite</a>, can any wild ivy be seen; though in the <a href=/people/7187 target=_blank>Agrionia</a> and Nyctelia (which are services to <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a> for the most part performed in the dark) it is to be found. Or was this a symbol of the prohibition of revels and sports of <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysos</a>? For women that were addicted to Bacchanal sports presently ran to the ivy and plucked it off, tearing it in pieces with their hands and gnawing it with their mouths, so that they are not altogether to be disbelieved that say it hath a spirit in it that stirreth and moveth to madness, transporting and bereaving of the senses, and that alone by itself it introduceth drunkenness without wine to those that have an easy inclination to enthusiasm. </p>                        </div>

Solution: Was it because in some places of Greece the dignity of priesthood was equal with kingship, and therefore they designated not ordinary persons to be priests? Or was it rather, — since they have appointed office-employments, whereas the charge of kings is unmethodical and indefinite, — that it would not be possible, if both fell out at the same time, that he should be able to attend both, but he must of necessity neglect one (both pressing together upon him), sometimes neglecting the worship of God, and sometimes injuring the subjects? Or else, seeing that there is no less necessity than power attending the administration of civil government, and that the ruler of the people (as <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> saith of the physician) doth see weighty matters and hath to do with weighty matters, and from other men's calamities procures troubles peculiar to himself, did they think him not sacred enough to sacrifice to the Gods and manage the sacrifices who had been present at the condemnation and execution of citizens, and often of some of his own kindred and family, as happened to <a href=/people/34 target=_blank>Brutus</a>? </p>                        </div>
