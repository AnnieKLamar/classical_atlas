He had his tent pitched alongside the actual beach so that the waves all but beat upon it: his purpose in so doing was to prevent anyone from hoping he would enjoy any respite, and to ensure that everyone was in a state of daily and hourly readiness. During this time he was unlucky with the weather, which was unsuitable for sailing; but for all that he still kept his rowers and troops aboard the ships and let slip no opportunity for setting forth, despite, above all, the reports which were coming in from the local provincials about the forces of the enemy — innumerable cavalry, four royal legions, a great quantity of light-armed troops, ten legions under command of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, 120 elephants and several fleets: yet even so he was not deterred, but remained resolute and optimistic. Meanwhile every day saw an increase in the number of his warships, and numerous transports also assembled there: four legions of recruits, the veteran Fifth legion, and some two thousand cavalry also joined the muster. </p>                        </div>

Each legion, as soon as it arrived, was embarked on the warships, while the cavalry were shipped aboard the transports. Accordingly, he ordered the greater part of the fleet to sail on ahead and make for the island of Aponiana, which is ten miles distant from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/378124ULil class=place long=12.4342 lat=37.7991>Lilybaeum</a>: he himself stayed behind there for a few days and sold up the property of a few persons for the profit of the state, and then gave full instructions to the praetor Alienus, who was governor of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, in particular about the prompt embarkation of the rest of the army. Having given these instructions, he himself embarked on December 25 and immediately caught up with the remainder of his fleet. And so, sailing in a fast ship with a steady wind, three days later with a few warships he came into sight of Africa; for his transports, which comprised the rest of his fleet, had, with a few exceptions, been scattered by the wind and, losing their course, made for various points along the coast. He sailed on past <a about=https://topostext.org/place/368111UAsp class=place long=11.1155 lat=36.8378>Clupea</a> with his fleet, and then past <a about=https://topostext.org/place/364107UNea class=place long=10.7195 lat=36.4405>Neapolis</a>; and besides these places he passed by quite a number of strongholds and towns not far from the sea. </p>                        </div>

He then pitched camp in front of the town and established himself without molesting anyone, looting being universally forbidden. Meanwhile the occupants of the town manned their battlements with armed troops, and massed in front of the gate to defend themselves: their numbers amounted to the equivalent of two legions. <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> rode round the town carefully observing the lie of the land, and then returned to camp. Some blamed him for lack of foresight because he had not originally briefed his pilots and captains about what points on the coast they were to make for, and had not, as had been his own habitual practice on previous occasions, issued sealed instructions to be read at a specified time, so that they could all make for a given rendezvous together. But this was by no means an oversight on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s part; in fact, he surmised that there was no port on African soil where his fleet could run ashore and which he could count on as immune from the enemy's protection; and failing that, he was on the watch for luck to present him with an opportunity to land. </p>                        </div>

Permission being granted, he accordingly wrote a letter, which he gave to a prisoner to take to <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a> in the town. As soon as the prisoner had arrived there, and when he was in the very act of handing <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a> the letter in accordance with his instructions, 'Where did you get this?' Whereupon the prisoner replied, 'From the commander-in-chief, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>.' Then <a href=/people/3564 target=_blank>Considius</a> retorted: 'There is but one commander-in-chief of the Roman people at the moment, namely <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>.' He then ordered the prisoner to be executed forthwith in his presence, and gave the letter — still unread and with its <a href=/people/10989 target=_blank>seals</a> intact — to a reliable messenger to take to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>. </p>                        </div>

For these reasons there seemed no point in staying for the purpose of attacking the town, lest, while engaged in that task, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> might be surrounded in the rear by the enemy cavalry and so find himself in difficulties. </p>                        </div>

On seeing this the legionary troops came to an abrupt halt, while the cavalry, few as they were, nevertheless displayed the utmost gallantry in charging against such vast numbers. An incredible thing took place: less than thirty Gallic cavalry dislodged two thousand Moorish cavalry and drove them to take refuge in the town. After they had been repulsed and hurled back within their fortifications, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> made haste to proceed with his projected march. But as the enemy repeated these tactics all too frequently — now following in pursuit, now once again driven back into the town by the cavalry — <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> posted in the rear of his column a few cohorts of the veteran troops which he had with him, as well as part of his cavalry, and so proceeded to march at a slow pace with the remainder of his force. In this way the further they withdrew from the town, the slower were the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> to pursue them. Meanwhile in the course of his march deputations arrived from towns and strongholds with promises of corn and assurances of their readiness to carry out any orders he might give them. And so on that day he pitched camp near the town of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/358108URus class=place long=10.8294 lat=35.7745>Ruspina</a>. </p>                        </div>

Envoys came from the town to meet him and promised they would readily do whatever he wished. Accordingly, he posted centurions and picquets at the town gates, to prevent any soldier from entering it or molesting any inhabitant, and then made his camp adjoining the shore, not far from the town. And it so chanced that some of his transports and warships arrived at this same place: as for the rest of them, it appeared from the reports which reached him that owing to their uncertain knowledge of the district they were making towards <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>. For the time being <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> would not leave the sea or strike inland on account of these wayward vessels, and kept all his cavalry aboard ship, his purpose being, I imagine, to prevent their pillaging the countryside; as for water, he ordered it to be carried aboard. Meanwhile <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s troops were taken by surprise when some rowers who had disembarked to fetch water were suddenly set upon by Moorish cavalry, who wounded many with their lances and killed some of them.

From them the enemy's plan became known. He had come with the intention of trying out new and unfamiliar battle tactics upon <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s legionaries, in order that — raw recruits and few in numbers as they were — they should be demoralised thereby, and be enveloped and crushed by the cavalry, as <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a> had been; and <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> had spoken to this effect to his troops on parade, that he would furnish <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s opponents with so vast a number of auxiliaries that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s men would be quite exhausted even with killing them, and so would be vanquished in the very hour of victory, and mastered by his forces. In fact, quite apart from the aid of those auxiliaries, he had reason for self-confidence: first because he had heard that at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> the veteran legions were mutinous and refusing to cross into Africa; next because he had kept his own troops in Africa for three years: they were acclimatised and he had now secured their loyalty to himself; he had, moreover, very large auxiliary forces composed of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> cavalry and light-armed troops and, besides these, the German and Gallic cavalry which, after the defeat and rout of <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompeius</a>, he, <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, had brought across with him from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/397200PBou class=place long=20.0206 lat=39.7456>Buthrotum</a>, as well as those which he had levied later on in Africa from half-castes, freedmen and slaves, and had armed and taught to handle a bridled <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>: he had in addition royal auxiliary forces, as well as a hundred and twenty elephants and innumerable cavalry; and finally, legions raised from more than twelve thousand men of every type. On such considerations was based the reckless confidence that fired <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>, with his sixteen hundred Gallic and German cavalry, his eight thousand <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> who rode without bridles, reinforced in addition by the cavalry contingent of <a href=/people/1898 target=_blank>Petreius</a>, sixteen hundred strong, and with his infantry and light-armed force, four times as big, and with his numerous archers, slingers and mounted arches.

And in his case his father had not the same imposing record as your father has, nor had he inherited from his ancestors the same position of eminent distinction, nor was he endowed with such influential ties of clientship or with a famous name, when he entered public life.

Their tears and complainings had no little effect on <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>; and though he had previously decided to wait for the beginning of summer to muster all his forces and auxiliaries from their permanent quarters and wage war on his opponents, he now resolved on a winter campaign, promptly drafting a despatch to Alienus and <a href=/people/4675 target=_blank>Rabirius</a> <a href=/people/2121 target=_blank>Postumus</a> in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>, which he sent by a reconnaissance vessel, to the effect that an army must be shipped across to him as quickly as possible: there must be no delay and no excuses on the ground of wintry weather or adverse winds.

His instructions to the cavalry on guard were to go on holding the positions in which they had been posted a little earlier, until they should come within range of the enemy's missiles; if the enemy advanced yet closer, they must then make as honourable a withdrawal as possible within the fortifications. As for the rest of the cavalry, they too had their orders — to be ready at hand, equipped and armed, each man in his proper place. These orders, however, he did not issue personally on the spot, surveying the situation for himself from the rampart; but so remarkable was his skill and knowledge of warfare that, making use of look-outs and orderlies, he issued the instructions necessary for his purpose as he sat in his head-quarters. For he observed that, although his opponents were relying on the great size of their forces, yet they were the very men whom he himself had often routed, beaten back and utterly demoralised, only to spare their lives and forgive their misdemeanours; in which circumstances, considering their own lack of initiative and their guilty conscience, they would never muster sufficient confidence in victory as to venture to attack his camp. Moreover, his own name and prestige had, to a great extent, a sobering effect upon the reckless spirit of their army. Then again the exceptional defences of the camp — the height of the rampart, the depth of the ditches, and the concealed stakes outside the rampart, marvellously well planted — all these, even without defenders, served to deter the enemy's approach; while as for scorpions, catapults and all the other normal weapons of defence, he had a plentiful supply of these. These he had prepared in advance in view of the small size and lack of experience of his own as it then was, and it was not because he was taken aback or dismayed at the enemy's might that he showed himself — to the enemy's thinking — long-suffering and timid. The reason why he would not lead his forces on to the field, few and inexperienced though they were, was not that he lacked confidence in his victory, but he considered the important question was — what manner of victory it would prove; for he thought it a personal slur if after all his achievements, after all the many brilliant victories he had won over such massive armies, men should look upon this victory as one gained only with much bloodshed over such remnants as his opponents had mustered from their routed forces. And so he had resolved to endure their boastful triumph until his second convoy should join him, including some portion of his veteran legions. </p>                        </div>

No sooner had these men been escorted to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> than they sought leave to speak out frankly without danger.

Their statement was speedily verified by actual events; for on the next day quite a number of legionary troops from the legions mentioned by the <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulians</a> deserted from <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s camp. </p>                        </div>

As for the Gauls and Germans, they stood their ground; but hemmed in between the enemy on the higher ground and those in their rear, despite a gallant resistance they were slaughtered to a man. On observing this, <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s legions, which were drawn up in front of his camp, were seized with a blind panic and began to flee by every gate into their camp. Now that <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and his forces had been swept in disorder from plain and hills and driven wholesale into their camp, <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> ordered the retreat to be sounded and withdrew all his cavalry inside his own fortifications; and it was then, when the field had been cleared, that his attention was caught by the amazing bodies of the Gauls and Germans: some of whom had followed <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> from Gaul in deference to his authority; others had been induced to join him by rewards and promises; and there were yet others who, having been made prisoners after <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s defeat and their lives being spared, had been anxious to give proof of their unswerving gratitude by maintaining a correspondingly unswerving loyalty. These were the men whose bodies, amazing in their beauty and stature, were lying mutilated and prostrate here and there all over the battle-field. </p>                        </div>

Apart from this, his arrangements for transporting his army from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a> were such as to allow only the troops themselves and their arms to be embarked, but no baggage, no slaves, none of the soldier's normal comforts. In Africa, moreover, not only had they neither bought nor provided themselves with anything, but in addition the high price of corn had run away with all their savings. In these straitened circumstances very few men indeed were sleeping under proper tents: the rest bivouacked under tents of a sort improvised from clothing or woven with reeds and twigs. And so when the rain came down suddenly and the hail followed it, their tents sagged under the weight, and were undermined and swept away by the violence of the floods: in the dead of night the storm put out their fires: all their victuals were ruined; and they wandered aimlessly hither and thither about the camp, covering their heads with their shields.

He was also anxious to discover, when he approached closer to the enemy, were they intended to fight. Over and above these reasons was the additional fact that this was a low-lying tract, and quite a few wells could be sunk in it: water in fact was in short supply and had to be carried a long distance.

But the latter found that this manoeuvre did not go according to plan; for <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> halted in his tracks and led his forces back to the assistance of his cavalry. The arrival of the legions put fresh heart into the cavalry, who wheeled round, charged the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> in the middle of their eager, but scattered pursuit, and drove them right back into the royal camp, with heavy casualties and many of their number killed. And had not nightfall speedily overtaken this action, and a cloud of dust raised up by the wind hampered everyone's vision, <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> and <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a> would have been captured and have fallen into <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s hands, and their cavalry and light-armed troops would have been utterly and entirely annihilated. Whereupon an incredible number of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s troops deserted from the Fourth and Sixth legion — some to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s camp, others to various places wherever each individual managed to find refuge. The cavalry who were once under <a href=/people/12110 target=_blank>Curio</a>'s command likewise lost confidence in <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> and his forces, and many of them took refuge with the others. </p>                        </div>

Avienus, a military tribune of the Tenth legion, had commandeered a vessel from the convoy and filled it with his own household slaves and beasts of burden, without transporting a single soldier from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>. Accordingly, on the following day <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> paraded the tribunes and centurions of all his legions and thus addressed them from the platform. 'I could have wished above all things that people would at some time or other have set bounds to their wanton and highly irresponsible behaviour, and had regard for my own leniency, moderation and forbearance. However, since they set themselves no limit or boundary, I myself will set them a precedent in accordance with military custom, so that the remainder may behave somewhat differently. Inasmuch as you, C. Avienus, in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> have stirred up soldiers of the Roman people against the state and have committed acts of plunder in various municipal towns; inasmuch as you have proved useless to me and to the state and have embarked, instead of troops, your own household slaves and beasts of burden, so that thanks to you the state is short of troops at a critical time; for these reasons I hereby discharge you with ignominy from my army and direct that you leave as soon as possible and be quit of Africa this day. You also, A. <a href=/people/2107 target=_blank>Fonteius</a>, I dismiss from my army, for having proved a mutinous military tribune and a disloyal citizen. T. Salienus, M. Tiro and C. Clusinas, you have attained your ranks in my army, not by merit, but by favour; your conduct has been such as to prove you neither brave in war, nor loyal nor competent in peace, and more eager to stir up mutiny among the troops against your commander-in-chief than to preserve respect and discipline; on these counts I deem you to be unworthy to hold rank in my army, and I hereby discharge you and direct that you be quit of Africa as soon as possible.' Accordingly he handed them over to the centurions, assigned them each no more than a single slave, and had them embarked separately in a ship. </p>                        </div>

When none the less the messenger brought back to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> the other's answer, namely that on the contrary it remained for him to complete the rest of his business, <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> also sent him a courier, in the hearing of <a href=/people/10228 target=_blank>Saserna</a>: 'The king forbids you to hold this conversation.' Alarmed by this message, <a href=/people/4427 target=_blank>Aquinus</a> withdrew in deference to the king's injunction. To think that it had come to this, that a Roman citizen, one, moreover, who had received office at the hands of the Roman people, at a time when his country and all his fortunes stood secure, should rather have obeyed <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>, a foreigner, than deferred to <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s instructions or else, if he preferred, let his own partisans be massacred, while he himself returned home safe and sound! Still more arrogant even was <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a>'s behaviour, not towards M. <a href=/people/4427 target=_blank>Aquinus</a>, a mere upstart and junior member of the Senate, but towards <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, whose family, rank and magistracies were such as to make him an outstanding man. For <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> had been in the habit of wearing a purple cloak before the king arrived; and <a href=/people/358 target=_blank>Juba</a> — so it is said — took the matter up with him, saying that <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> ought not to wear the same dress as he himself wore.

After riding round encouraging his legions he gave the signal and awaited the enemy's advance. For he himself had good reason not to advance too far from his fortifications, since the town of Uzitta, held by <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, contained enemy cohorts under arms; moreover, his right-hand wing lay opposite the said town, and he was afraid that, if he advanced beyond it, the enemy might make a sally from the town, attack him in flank, and maul him severely.

His elephants he had placed at regular intervals on his right and left wings, and behind the elephants his light-armed troops and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> auxiliaries were stationed in support. On his right wing he had posted his entire force of bridled cavalry; for his left wing was covered by the town of Uzitta, and there was no room to deploy cavalry. In addition he had posted some <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> and a vast multitude of light-armed troops to cover the right flank of his line at a distance of at least a mile or so, pushing them more towards the foothills and so withdrawing them farther away both from the enemy and his own forces. His purpose in doing this was that when the two battle lines charged one another, his cavalry would only have to continue their outflanking movement a little farther in the early stages of the action, and then by sheer weight of numbers they could surprise and envelop <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s army, throw it into disorder, and riddle it with lances.

As for the actual right wing, he had posted there some of the cohorts of his veteran legions as well as a few cohorts from the legions of recruits besides. His third line he had concentrated on his left wing, extending it right up to the central legion of his line, and had arranged it in such a formation that his left wing was composed of three lines. His motive for doing this was the fact that, whereas his right flank was supported by his fortifications, he was hard put to it to know how his left flank could bear up under the hordes of enemy cavalry; and it was on this same left flank that he had concentrated the whole of his own cavalry and, not feeling too confident in it, had detached the Fifth legion to support this cavalry, and drafted light-armed troops at intervals among the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>.

And now, while <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> was beginning to lead his army back within his fortifications, suddenly the entire force of cavalry — the more distant one, comprising <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=ethnic long=3 lat=36>Numidians</a> and <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulians</a> riding without bridles — began a movement on the right and to advance closer to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s camp on the high ground, while <a href=/people/780 target=_blank>Labienus</a>' bridled cavalry maintained their positions and distracted the attention of the legions. Whereupon part of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s cavalry together with the light-armed troops, acting without orders and without discretion, suddenly advanced too far, crossed a marshy tract and found themselves too far outnumbered to be able to contain the enemy. Abandoning the light-armed troops, the cavalry were driven back and fled to their own lines not without casualties — one horseman missing, many <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> wounded and twenty-seven light-armed soldiers killed. It was now night when <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>, delighted with this successful cavalry engagement, withdrew his forces into camp. But in vouchsafing him this triumph the fortunes of war saw fit to make it but short-lived. On the following day, in fact, a detachment of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s cavalry which he had sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/357109ULep class=place long=10.8663 lat=35.6781>Leptis</a> on a foraging mission surprised in the course of their march and attacked about a hundred marauding <a about=https://topostext.org/place/360030RNum class=demonym long=3 lat=36>Numidian</a> and <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulian</a> <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, killing some of them and taking the rest alive. Meanwhile <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> made it his constant and daily practice to lead his legions down into the plain, proceed with his field-works, carry his rampart and trench across the middle of the present, and thereby hinder his opponents' sallies. <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> likewise built counter-defences, pushing them forward in haste to prevent <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> from barring him access to the ridge. Thus the generals on both sides were occupied with field-works, but none the less engaged one another daily in cavalry actions. </p>                        </div>

Here, however, was one problem to which he had found an answer; for he had ordered elephants to be brought across from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a> to enable our troops not only to become familiar with them, but also to get to know both the appearance and capabilities of the beast, what part of its body was readily vulnerable to a missile and, when an elephant was accoutred and armoured, what part of its body was still left uncovered and unprotected, so that their missiles should be aimed at that spot. He had also this further object in mind, that his <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> would learn by familiarity with these beasts not to be alarmed by their scent, trumpeting or appearance. From this experiment he had profited handsomely: for the troops handled the beasts and came to appreciate their sluggishness; the cavalry hurled dummy javelins at them; and the docility of the beasts had brought the <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a> to feel at home with them. </p>                        </div>

And no wonder: for the troops he now commanded had been used to fighting in the flat terrain of Gaul against Gauls — men of forthright character with barely a trace of deceit, whose habit it is to rely on valour, not on guile, in their fighting; whereas now he had to perform the ardour takes of accustoming his troops to recognise the tricks, traps and stratagems of the enemy, and what tactics could fittingly be adopted, and what avoided. Accordingly, to speed up this training of theirs, he took pains not to keep the legions confined to one area, but to keep them constantly on the move, first to one spot, then to another, ostensibly for foraging purposes, for the very reason that he reckoned the enemy forces would not fail to follow in his tracks. And two days later, when he had led forth his forces duly and carefully deployed, he marched past close to the enemy's camp and challenged them to battle on level ground; but when he saw the enemy reluctant to accept, he led his legions back to camp as evening was approaching. </p>                        </div>

When it observed him coming towards it with weapon poised to strike, the elephant abandoned the corpse, encircled the soldier with its trunk, and lifted him up in the air. The soldier, perceiving that a dangerous crisis of this sort demand resolute action on his part, hewed with his sword again and again at the encircling trunk with all the strength he could muster. The resulting pain caused the elephant to drop the soldier, wheel round, and with shrill trumpetings make all speed to rejoin its fellows. </p>                        </div>

They were, however, prevented from reaching land by stones and heavy javelins hurled by the slaves and lackeys in the camp; and so they returned back into the town. Meanwhile <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s forces, now thrown into utter confusion, were in wholesale retreat in every sector of the field, and <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s legions promptly pursued them without giving them any respite in which to pull themselves together. When the fugitives reached the camp they were making for, with the object of making a recovery there and defending themselves once more, and of trying to find someone to lead them — someone to look up to, under whose authority and command they could carry on the fight; when they got there and perceived that there was nobody guarding it, they forthwith discarded their armour and beat a hasty retreat to the royal camp. This too on their arrival they saw to be in the hands of the Julians. Abandoning all hope of salvation, they now halted on a hill and gave the military salute by lowering their arms. This gesture, unhappily for them, stood them in but little stead. For <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s veterans were filled with such burning indignation and resentment that, so far from any possibility of inducing them to spare the enemy, they actually wounded or killed several men of culture and distinction among the ranks of their own side, calling them ringleaders. Among these was <a href=/people/364 target=_blank>Tullius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a>, an ex-quaestor, who was mortally wounded by a soldier who deliberately ran him through with a heavy javelin; and similarly <a href=/people/151 target=_blank>Pompeius</a> <a href=/people/519 target=_blank>Rufus</a> was stabbed in the arm with a sword and would have been done to death, had he not promptly rushed to <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s side. This behaviour caused grave alarm among quite a number of Roman knights and senators, who retired from the battle lest they themselves should also be massacred by the soldiers, who after so resounding a victory had apparently taken it for granted that they were free to perpetrate any excesses, on the assumption that they would go unpunished in view of their magnificent achievements. Accordingly, although all these troops of <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a> implored <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s protection, they were massacred to a man, despite the fact that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> himself was looking on and entreating his troops to spare them. </p>                        </div>

He then addressed a personal appeal to <a href=/people/4739 target=_blank>Vergilius</a> inviting him to surrender and reminding him of his own leniency and clemency; but on failing to observe any response he withdrew from the town. On the following day, after offering sacrifice, he held a parade and in full view of the occupants of the town congratulated his troops, rewarding his entire veteran force and bestowing decorations publicly in front of the dais for conspicuous gallantry and meritorious service.

Being refused admittance by the inhabitants — for the tidings of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s victory had preceded them — they gained possession of the town by force; then, making a pile of faggots in the middle of the market-place and heaping on top all the inhabitants' possessions, they set fire to it and then flung into the flames, alive and bound, the inhabitants of the town themselves, irrespective of rank or age, thereby meting out to them the most cruel of all punishments.

As for the town's senate, he kept it under restraint. This concentration camp of theirs <a href=/people/22 target=_blank>Scipio</a>'s horsemen now attacked and began to storm, for the very reason that they knew that its occupants had been adherents of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s side; and if they massacred them their destruction might serve to avenge their own sense of disappointment. But the people of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>, emboldened as a result of <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a>'s victory, drove back the horsemen with stones and clubs.

He had collapsed but was still breathing when his doctor and some members of his household, suspecting something amiss, forced their way into the bedroom and proceeded to staunch and bind up the wound; but with his own hands he tore it open with utter ruthlessness and resolutely made an end of himself.

But while he was on the road the <a href=/people/12044 target=_blank>Gaetulians</a> who bore him company cut him down in their impatience to loot his treasure, and then made off, as best they could, in various directions. Meanwhile C. <a href=/people/4739 target=_blank>Vergilius</a>, who was cut off alike by land and sea, perceived that he was making no progress: that M. <a href=/people/41 target=_blank>Cato</a> had taken his own life at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>: that the king was a wanderer at large, abandoned by his subjects and held in universal contempt: that Saburra and his troops had been destroyed by <a href=/people/2545 target=_blank>Sittius</a>: that <a href=/people/3 target=_blank>Caesar</a> had been received without opposition at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371101UUti class=place long=10.0623 lat=37.0565>Utica</a>; and that out of all that vast army there was nothing left whatever. For his own part, therefore, he accepted the safeguard for himself and his children offered him by the pro-consul <a href=/people/1657 target=_blank>Caninius</a>, who was blockading him, and surrendered himself to the latter with all his effects and the town. </p>                        </div>
