Now, the whole of the land was in the hands of a few, and if the cultivators did not pay their rents, they became subject to bondage, both they and their children, and were bound to their creditors on the security of their persons, up to the time of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>. For he was the first to come forward as the champion of the people. The hardest and bitterest thing then to the majority was that they had no share in the offices of government; not but what they were dissatisfied with everything else, for in nothing, so to say, had they any share. </p>                        </div>

Officers of state were appointed on the basis of merit and wealth, and at first remained in office for life, but afterwards for a period of ten years. And the greatest and earliest of the officers of state were the king, and commander-in-chief, and archon; and earliest of these was the office of king, for this was established at the beginning; next followed that of commander-in-chief, owing to some of the kings proving unwarlike, and it was for this reason that they sent for <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> when the need arose; and last (of the three) was the archonship — for most authorities say it was established in the time of <a href=/people/1230 target=_blank>Medon</a>, but some in the time of <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a>; and they adduce as evidence the fact that the nine archons swear to exercise their office just as they did in the time of <a href=/people/805 target=_blank>Acastus</a> — as the <a href=/people/5569 target=_blank>Codridae</a> having retired in the time of his kingship . . . Now, which of the two accounts is correct is of little importance, but there is no doubt of the fact having actually occurred in these times: and that it was the last of these offices that was established, there is further evidence . . . . that the archon administers just like the king and the commander-in-chief, but . . . . for which reason it is only recently that the office has become important, its dignity having been increased by the privileges that have been added to it. <a href=/people/1119 target=_blank>Thesmothetae</a> were appointed many years afterwards, being elected to their offices from the first for a year, for the purpose of recording the enactments in writing, and preserving them against the trial of such as transgressed the law; for which reason it was the sole office that was not established for more than a year. So far, therefore, these take precedence of others. The nine archons did not all live together, but the king occupied what is now called the Boukoleion, near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPry class=place long=23.7307 lat=37.9709>Prytaneum</a> (in confirmation of which even to this day the marriage of the king's wife with <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a> takes place here), and the archon resides in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BPry class=place long=23.7307 lat=37.9709>Prytaneum</a>, and the commander-in-chief in the <a href=/people/9332 target=_blank>Epilyceum</a>. This was formerly called the Polemarchaion, but from the time that <a href=/people/2407 target=_blank>Epilycus</a>, when polemarch, rebuilt and furnished it, it was called <a href=/people/9332 target=_blank>Epilyceum</a>: and the <a href=/people/1119 target=_blank>Thesmothetae</a> occupied the <a href=/people/1119 target=_blank>Thesmotheteum</a>. But in the time of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> they all lived together in the <a href=/people/1119 target=_blank>Thesmotheteum</a>. And they had power to decide law-suits finally, and not as now merely to hold a preliminary inquiry. Such, then, were the arrangements in respect of the officers of state. The duty of the council of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagitae</a> was to jealously guard the laws, and it administered most of the affairs of state, and those the most important, both by punishing and fining all offenders with authority; for the election of the archons was on the basis of merit and wealth, and of them the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagitae</a> were composed; this is the reason why it is the only office that continues to be held for life up to the present time. </p>                        </div>

And after this, at no long interval, when <a href=/people/5463 target=_blank>Aristaechmus</a> was archon [624/3 BCE], <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a> made his laws; and this constitution was as follows. Share in the government was assigned to those who provided themselves with arms; and they chose for the nine archons and the treasurers such as were possessed of property to the value of not less than ten minae free of all encumbrances, and for the other minor offices such as provided themselves with arms, and for generals and commanders of cavalry such as could show property of not less than a hundred minae free of all encumbrances, and children born in lawful wedlock above ten years of age; these were to be the presidents of the council and generals and commanders of cavalry . . . up to the time of the audit of their accounts . . . . and receiving from the same rating as the generals and commanders of cavalry. The Council was to consist of four hundred and one, selected by lot from the whole body of citizens; such as were over thirty years of age were to obtain this and the other offices by lot, and the same man was not to hold office twice before all had had their turn; and then appointment was to be made afresh by lot. If any member of the Council, when there was a sitting of the Council or Assembly, was absent from the meeting, he had to pay a fine, the <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimnos</a> (the possessor of land which produced five hundred medimni yearly) three drachmae, the Knight two, and the Zeugitae (those who possessed a team of <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a>) one. And the council of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> was the guardian of the laws, and jealously watched the magistrates to see that they administered their offices according to the laws.

As strife ran high, and the two parties had saced each other for a considerable time, they agreed to choose <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> as mediator and archon, and entrusted the constitution to him after he had composed a poem in elegiac metre, of which the beginning is as follows: 'I ponder, and within my soul lie woes, As I look on the most honourable land in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=place long=27.3 lat=38>Ionia</a>;' for he ever took the lead, fighting and disputing vigorously for each side against the other, and afterwards recommended them both to put an end to the existing strife. Now, in power of speech and reputation <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> ranked among the first, but in property and position among the moderately rich, as is admitted by all, and as he himself bears witness in these verses, where he recommends the rich not to be grasping: 'Do ye, quieting in your bosoms your strong hearts, Who of many good things have had your fill even to surfeit, With what is moderate nourish your mighty desire; for neither will We yield, nor shall you have all else as you wish.' And in his poems generally he fastens on the rich the blame of these divisions; and it is for this reason, at the beginning of his elegy, he says that he fears the love of money and over-weening pride, attributing to them the enmity that existed. </p>                        </div>

It is in regard to these measures that men try to attack his character. For it happened that when <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> was about to make the <a href=/people/8298 target=_blank>Seisachtheia</a>, he announced it first to some of the upper class, and then, as the popular side say, his friends stole a march upon him, while the possessors of property bring the injurious charge that he made a profit himself. For these friends borrowed money and bought up a great quantity of land, and as the cancelling of debts took place not long afterwards, they became at once rich; this, they say, is the origin of the class who afterwards had the reputation of being rich from of old. Not but what the account of the popular side is the more trustworthy; for it is not reasonable that in all other respects he should have shown himself so moderate and impartial — while it rested entirely with himself whether, or not, he would, by introducing his laws in an underhand way, make himself master of the state, and so an object of hatred to both sides, as also, whether, or not, he would prefer honour and the salvation of the state to any greed for his own gain — it is not reasonable, I say, to suppose that in such petty and unworthy matters he would defile himself. That he possessed such power, and remedied the distempered state of affairs, both he himself records in many passages of his poems, and all others agree. This charge, therefore, should be adjudged false. </p>                        </div>

And he ratified the laws for a hundred years, and constituted the government in the following way: He divided property qualifications into four ratings, just as a division had existed before, viz., the <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimnos</a>, the Knights, the Zeugites, and the Thetes (poorest class). He assigned as officers of state out of <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimni</a> and Knights and Zeugitae, the nine archons and the treasurers, and the government-sellers and the Eleven and the Kolakratae, to each class assigning office in proportion to the magnitude of its assessment. To the class of Thetes he gave a share only in the Assembly and courts of justice. And all had to class as <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimni</a> who, from their own property, made five hundred measures, dry and wet combined, and in the class of Knights such as made three hundred, or, as some say, were able to keep a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>: the latter bring as evidence both the name of the class, as if it had been given from that fact, as well as the votive offerings of men of old; for there is an offering in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> of a figure of <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> with the following inscription: 'Anthemion dedicated this figure of <a href=/people/413 target=_blank>Diphilus</a> to the gods When he exchanged the thetic rating for the knightly rank.' And there stands beside it a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, witnessing that it means the class of Knights. Not but what it is more reasonable that they were classified by measures just in the same way as the <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimni</a>. And all had to be rated as Zeugitae who made two hundred measures combined, and all the rest as Thetes, having no share in any office of state; for which reason even now, if anyone going to be elected to an office were asked in what class he was rated, he would never think of saying in that of the Thetes. </p>                        </div>

Now, there were four tribes just as before, and four tribe-kings. Each tribe was divided into three <a href=/people/7015 target=_blank>Trittyes</a> (thirds of a tribe) and twelve <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrariae</a>. Magistrates of the <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrariae</a> were appointed, viz., the <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrari</a>, who had charge of the current revenues and expenditure; and this is the reason why (as is probable) it is ordained in the laws of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, by which they are no longer governed, that the <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrari</a> should get in the moneys and make disbursements from the Naukraric funds.

Now, these were the duties that he assigned in their case. And seeing that the state was often torn by faction, and that some of the citizens from indifference stood aloof, of his own motion he passed a law specially directed against them as follows — that anyone who, when the state was divided into parties, did not take up arms and side with one or the other, should be deprived of his political rights, and have no part in the state. </p>                        </div>

Now, the following are the three provisions of the constitution of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> which appear to be the most favourable to the people: first and foremost, the prohibition of loans on the security of the person; then the right accorded to anyone who wished to seek in the courts a remedy for his wrongs; and third (by which, most of all, they say the masses have acquired power), the right of appeal to the court of justice; for when the people is master of the vote, it becomes master of the government. Its power was still further augmented at this time by the want of simplicity in the framing of the laws, and the uncertainty in their interpretation, for as in the case of the law regarding inheritances and only daughters and heiresses, it was inevitable that disputes should arise, and consequently that the courts of law would be the judges in all matters public as well as private. Now, some think that he made his laws uncertain with the express purpose of giving the people some control over the judicial power. Not that this is probable, the explanation rather being that he was unable to embrace in his laws what was best as a general rule and in every particular instance; for it is not right to infer his intention from what is now taking place, but it should be looked for rather in the general spirit of his constitution. </p>                        </div>

For the people thought that he would make a redistribution of property, and the upper ranks that he would restore again the old order of things.

But such as possessed power, and from their wealth were leaders, Them I counselled to retain nothing unseemly. I stood with my mighty shield thrown around both, And suffered not either to triumph unrighteously.' And again when expressing his opinion as to how the people ought to be treated: The people in this way would follow best with its leaders Under neither too slack nor too strait a control. For satiety is the parent of insolence, whenever great prosperity follows Men whose disposition is not well ordered.' And again, read where he speaks about such as wished to divide the land among themselves: 'And they came on the spoil with a wealth of hope, And they thought each of them to find great prosperity, And that I, though talking smoothly, would manifest a harsh spirit. Vain were their thoughts then, and now angered with me, With eyes askance all regard me like enemies. Not rightly; for what I said, with the help of the gods, I have accomplished; But other things I was attempting in vain, nor does it please me To do aught by force of tyranny, or of our rich fatherland That the bad should have an equal share with the good.' And again also about the distress of the poor, and those who were before in bondage, but were made free by the cancelling of debts: 'But for what reason I the people whirling On the axle . . . .

For these reasons, girding myself with strength on all sides, I bore me as a <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolf</a> amid many <a href=/people/10953 target=_blank>hounds</a>.' And again, when he reproaches them for the complaints that each side afterwards levelled against him: 'If it is right to reproach the people plainly, What they now possess, still sleeping, They ne'er had looked on with their eyes. All who are more powerful and in might better Would commend and claim me as their friend.' For he says that if ever anybody obtained this honour, he did: 'He would not have controlled the people, or stopt Before he had disturbed and carried off the beestings; But I between them in the gap like a barrier Planted myself.' </p>                        </div>

After he had left his country, although the city was still in an unquiet state, for four years they lived in peace; but in the fifth year after the magistracy of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a> they did not appoint an archon, owing to the factions which prevailed; and a second time in the fifth year, for the same reason, they did not appoint to the office. And after this, in the same period, <a href=/people/4136 target=_blank>Damasias</a> was elected archon, and continued in office for two years and two months, until he was driven from it by force.

And they continued generally in an unhealthy state in their relations with one another, some on the score of office, and making a pretext of the cancelling of debts, for they had become poor men in consequence; some from discontent at the government, because the change had been great; and others because of their rivalry with one another. The divisions were three: one the party of the Shore, at the head of which was <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megakles</a>, the son of Alkmaeon, and they had the reputation of aiming, most of all, at a moderate government; and the second, the party of the Plain, who sought an oligarchy, with Lykurgus as their leader; and the third, the party of the Mountain, at the head of which stood <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, with the character of being a strong partisan of the people. And the ranks of this party had been swollen by such as had been relieved of their debts in consequence of their poverty, and by such as were not of pure blood from motives of fear. Evidence of this is afforded by the fact that after the establishment of tyrants they made a proclamation that it was not fitting that many should participate in the government.

They then came and informed <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>. After finishing his speech, he told the people what had been done about their arms, saying that they had no need to be surprised or out of heart, but bade them go home and attend to their own affairs, adding that all public matters would now be his concern. </p>                        </div>

                            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:16'><b>&sect; 16</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyranny of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> was at first established in this way, and experienced the changes just enumerated. As we have said, <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> administered the government with moderation, and more like a citizen than a tyrant. For, in applying the laws, he was humane and mild, and towards offenders clement, and, further, he used to advance money to the needy for their agricultural operations, thus enabling them to carry on the cultivation of their lands uninterruptedly. And this he did with two objects: that they might not live in the city, but being scattered over the country, and enjoying moderate means and engaged in their own affairs, they might have neither the desire nor the leisure to concern themselves with public matters. At the same time he had the advantage of a greater revenue from the careful cultivation of the land; for he took a tithe of the produce. It was for this reason, too, that he instituted jurors throughout the demes, and often, leaving the capital, made tours in the country, seeing matters for himself, and reconciling such as had differences, so that they might have no occasion to come to the city and neglect their lands. It was on such a tour that the incident is said to have occurred about the man in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379238LHym class=place long=23.815 lat=37.946>Hymettus</a>, who was cultivating what was afterwards called the 'No-Tax-Land.' For seeing a man delving at rocks with a wooden peg and working away, he wondered at his using such a tool, and bade his attendants ask what the spot produced. 'Every ill and every woe under the sun,' replied the man, 'and <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> must take his tithe of these ills and these woes.' Now, the man made this answer not knowing who he was; but <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, pleased at his boldness of speech and love of work, gave him immunity from all taxes. And he never interfered with the people in any other way indeed during his rule, but ever cultivated peace and watched over it in times of tranquillity. And this is the reason why it often passed as a proverb that the tyranny of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> was the life of the Golden Age; for it came to pass afterwards, through the insolence of his sons, that the government became much harsher. But what more than any other of his qualities made him a favourite was his popular sympathies and kindness of disposition. For while in all other matters it was his custom to govern entirely according to the laws, so he never allowed himself any unfair advantage, and on one occasion when he was cited before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> on a charge of murder, he appeared himself in his own defence, and his accuser, getting frightened, withdrew from the suit. It was for such reasons also, that he remained tyrant for a long period, and when he lost his power easily recovered it again; for most of the upper classes and of the popular side desired it, since he helped the one by his intercourse with them, and the other by his assistance in their private affairs, and from his natural disposition could adapt himself to both. The laws of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> regarding tyrants were mild in these times, all of them, and particularly the one relating to any attempt at tyranny, for their law stood as follows: 'These are the ordinances of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, inherited from their fathers: whoever rises up to make himself a tyrant, or assists in establishing a tyranny, shall be deprived of his political rights, both himself and his family.' </p>                        </div>

Of this period he continued in power nineteen years, for he was in exile the remainder of the time.

But <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> was fond of trifling, amorous, and a votary of the <a href=/people/54 target=_blank>Muses</a>; it was he who sent for <a href=/people/543 target=_blank>Anacreon</a> and <a href=/people/262 target=_blank>Simonides</a>, and the rest of the poets, with their companions. <a href=/people/1339 target=_blank>Thessalus</a> was much younger, and in his manner of life overbearing and insolent. And from him came the beginning of all their ills. For being enamoured of <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a>, and meeting with no response to his affection, he could not restrain his wrath, but took every opportunity of displaying the bitterness of his hatred. At last, when <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a>' sister was going to act as basket-bearer in the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a>, he forbade her, and made use of some abusive expressions about <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> being a coward, the result of which was that <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a> were incited to do their deed in conjunction with many of their fellow-citizens. The celebration of the <a href=/people/11002 target=_blank>Panathenaea</a> was proceeding, and they were lying in wait for <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> on the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a> (now, he happened to be following whilst <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> was getting the procession ready), when they saw one of their fellow-conspirators in friendly conversation with <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a>; thinking that he was turning informer, and wishing to do something before they were arrested, they descended from the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SAkr class=place long=23.7257 lat=37.9717>Acropolis</a>, and without waiting for the rest of the conspirators, killed <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SLeo class=place long=23.723 lat=37.9761>Leokoreion</a> as he was arranging the procession. Thus they ruined the whole plot, and of their number <a href=/people/600 target=_blank>Harmodius</a> was straightway killed by the spearmen, and <a href=/people/496 target=_blank>Aristogeiton</a> was subsequently apprehended, and for a long time subjected to outrage. When he was put to the torture he accused many who were both of illustrious birth and friendly to the tyrants. For it was impossible on the spot to get any clue to the affair, and the story that is told how <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> disarmed those who were taking part in the procession, and thus caught such as had daggers upon them, is not true; for at that time armed men did not take part in the procession, and the practice was introduced by the people in after-times. And he accused the friends of the tyrants, as the popular side say, on purpose that they might commit an act of impiety, and show their baseness by destroying the guiltless and their own friends; but some say, on the other hand, that it was not an invention on his part, but he informed against such as were actually privy to the plot. And at last, when he was unable, do what he would, to compass his death, he promised to reveal many others, and persuading <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> to give him his right hand as a pledge of his good faith, as he held it he reviled him for giving his right hand to the murderer of his brother, and so exasperated <a href=/people/229 target=_blank>Hippias</a> that he could not restrain his rage, but drew his sword and despatched him on the spot. </p>                        </div>

And at that time, when he was at the head of the masses, in the fourth year after the overthrow of the tyrants, he first distributed them all into ten tribes instead of four as previously, wishing to mix them up in order that more might have a share in the government; hence the saying, 'not to examine the tribes,' as addressed to those who wished to review the lists of the families. Afterwards he made the Council five hundred instead of four hundred, taking fifty from each tribe, for at that time there were a hundred from each tribe. And the reason why he did not distribute them into twelve tribes was that he might not have to divide them according to the existing <a href=/people/7015 target=_blank>Trittyes</a> (third parts of tribes); for the four tribes were composed of twelve <a href=/people/7015 target=_blank>Trittyes</a>, with the result that the masses were not intermingled. And he divided the country by demes into thirty parts, ten for the neighbourhood of the city, ten for the shore districts, and ten for the interior, and calling these <a href=/people/7015 target=_blank>Trittyes</a>, he allotted three to each tribe, that each might have a part in all the different localities. And he made fellow-members of the same deme those who lived in each of the demes, in order that they might not, by calling after the name of the father, detect the new citizens, but give them their surnames from their demes; hence it is that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> do call themselves by their demes. He also established presidents of the demes, with the same duties as the former <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrari</a>; for he also made the demes take the place of the <a href=/people/8015 target=_blank>Naukrariae</a>. And he named some of the demes from their localities, and others from their founders; since some of the localities now erected into demes had no founders from whom they could be called. But the Gene (collections of families) and Phratriae (three to a tribe, and comprising each thirty Gene) and the priesthoods he allowed each to retain as they had come down to them from their forefathers. And to the tribes he gave surnames from the hundred selected founders whom the <a href=/people/10998 target=_blank>Pythia</a> appointed, to the number of ten. </p>                        </div>

First then in the fifth year after this settlement, in the archonship of Hermoukreon they drew up for the Council of the five hundred the oath by which they swear even to this day; then they chose the generals by tribes, from each tribe one, and the polemarch was the commander-in-chief. In the twelfth year after this, when they had been victorious at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381241LMaB class=place long=24.0002 lat=38.144>Marathon</a>, in the archonship of <a href=/people/1713 target=_blank>Phaenippus</a>, and two years had elapsed since the victory, and the people had now grown bold, then it was that for the first time they put in force the law about ostracism. Now this law had been passed by reason of their suspicion of those in power, because <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a> had established himself as tyrant when he was a leader of the people and a general. The very first man to be ostracised was one of his relations, <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2507 target=_blank>Charmus</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DKll class=place long=23.726 lat=37.967>Kolyttus</a>, on whose account especially it was that <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Kleisthenes</a>, wishing to get him banished, passed the law. For the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> allowed all the friends of the tyrants, who had not taken any part in wrong-doing during the troubles, to live in the city, thus displaying the wonted clemency of the popular government. Of these <a href=/people/251 target=_blank>Hipparchus</a> was the leader and representative. At the beginning of the following year, in the archonship of <a href=/people/2191 target=_blank>Telesinus</a>, they appointed by lot the nine archons according to tribes from the five hundred, who had been selected by the members of demes immediately after the tyranny (for formerly they had been all elected). And <a href=/people/789 target=_blank>Megakles</a>, the son of <a href=/people/197 target=_blank>Hippocrates</a> of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237DAlo class=person long=23.75 lat=37.95>Alopeke</a>, was ostracised. For three years then they kept ostracising the friends of the tyrants, and after this in the fourth year they removed anyone else besides who appeared to be too powerful. The first to be ostracised of those who were not connected with the tyranny was <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/2389 target=_blank>Ariphron</a>. And in the third year after this, during the archonship of <a href=/people/2247 target=_blank>Nicodemus</a> (483 BCE), when the mines at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377240QMar class=place long=24.014 lat=37.726>Maronea</a> were discovered, and the state acquired a hundred talents from working them, some counselled the people to divide the money among themselves. But <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistokles</a> would not allow it, declaring that he would not use the money, and urged them to advance it on loan to the hundred richest men among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, to each a talent, and then recommended, if it met their approval, that it should be expended in the service of the state, and if not, that they should get in the money from those who had borrowed it. Getting the money in this way, he had a hundred triremes built, each of the hundred talents building one; and it was with these ships that they fought at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a> against the barbarians. In these times <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>, the son of <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, was ostracised. And in the fourth year, in the archonship of Hypsichides, they received back all who had been ostracised, in consequence of <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>' expedition. And for the future they made <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380245HGer class=place long=24.539 lat=37.977>Geraistos</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/374235LSky class=place long=23.5297 lat=37.43785>Scyllaion</a> the prescribed limits within which ostracised persons were free to live, and in default they were to lose their political rights for ever. </p>                        </div>

They accordingly made use of the services of the one in war, and of the other in council. The rebuilding of the walls, however, was conducted by both of them together, notwithstanding their political differences; but it was <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> who urged on the revolt of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon class=ethnic long=27.3 lat=38>Ionians</a> and the alliance with the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a>, watching his opportunity when the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/370225RLak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=37.001>Laconians</a> had been brought into ill-odour by the doings of <a href=/people/117 target=_blank>Pausanias</a>.

First he made away with many of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagitae</a>, bringing actions against them for their administration. Afterwards, in the archonship of <a href=/people/164 target=_blank>Konon</a>, he stripped the council of all the privileges, in right of which it was the guardian of the constitution, and made them over partly to the five hundred and partly to the courts of justice.

And desiring the overthrow of the council, <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistokles</a> told <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a> that the council intended to seize him as well as himself, while at the same time he told the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagitae</a> that he would point out to them those who were banding together for the overthrow of the government. And taking the persons who were despatched by the council to the house of <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a>, to point out to them those who were meeting together there, he joined in earnest conversation with the representatives of the council. And <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a>, seeing this, in alarm took refuge at the altar with only his tunic on.

Now <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Kimon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, was at their head, a man comparatively young, and who had entered upon public life late. Moreover, the greater portion of this party had been destroyed in war, which happened in this way: The army was enrolled in those times from those who were on the list for service, and generals were appointed to command who had no experience of war, but were held in honour for their ancestral glories, the consequence of which was, that those who went to the wars perished by two or three thousand at a time. In this way the moderate men, both of the people and of the well-to-do, were used up. Now, in everything else the government was administered differently to what it was before, when men gave heed to the laws, but the election of the nine archons was not disturbed. Still, in the sixth year after the death of <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a>, they decreed that those who were to be balloted for in the elections of the nine archons should be selected also from the Zeugitae, and the first of that class who filled the office was <a href=/people/5124 target=_blank>Mnesitheides</a>. But all before him had belonged to the Knights and <a href=/people/10022 target=_blank>Pentakosiomedimni</a>, while the Zeugitae used to hold the offices that went round in succession (but not the archonship), unless some oversight of the provisions of the laws chanced to occur.

And in the forty-ninth year after the seafight at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380236ASSB class=place long=23.573 lat=37.952>Salamis</a>, in the archonship of <a href=/people/1321 target=_blank>Pythodorus</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375222RPel class=demonym long=22.15 lat=37.54>Peloponnesian</a> war broke out, during which the people, shut up as they were in the city and accustomed to serve for pay in the armies, partly of their own free will, and partly against their wishes, elected to administer the government themselves. And <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Perikles</a> was the first to introduce pay for the services of the jurors, thus bidding for popularity as against the influence that <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Kimon</a> derived from his ample means. For <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Kimon</a>, as the possessor of royal wealth, first discharged the public services with great splendour, and afterwards supported many of the members of his deme.

And to these causes some assign the deterioration in the conduct of affairs, as the appointments to office were designedly made more and more by haphazard instead of by merit.

For then, for the first time, the people took for its leader a man who was not held in respect by such as entertained moderate views; whereas in former times it had always, without exception, been led by men of character. For it began with <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>, who was the first to come forward as the leader of the people; and next <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>, who belonged to the nobles and upper class; and after the overthrow of the tyranny came <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Kleisthenes</a>, who was of the house of the <a href=/people/1344 target=_blank>Alkmaeonidae</a>, and had no party-leader in opposition to him after the banishment of <a href=/people/2054 target=_blank>Isagoras</a> and his faction. After this <a href=/people/727 target=_blank>Xanthippus</a> was at the head of the people, while <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a> represented the upper classes. Next came <a href=/people/77 target=_blank>Themistokles</a> and <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a>; after them <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a> was at the head of the democratic party, and <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Kimon</a>, the son of <a href=/people/260 target=_blank>Miltiades</a>, at the head of the wealthy classes. Then <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Perikles</a> represented the democratic party, and <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a>, who was a connection by marriage of <a href=/people/198 target=_blank>Kimon</a>, the other side. On the death of <a href=/people/92 target=_blank>Perikles</a>, <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nikias</a> took the lead of the nobles, he who met his end in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic class=place long=14.5 lat=37.6>Sicily</a>; and of the democratic party, <a href=/people/285 target=_blank>Kleon</a>, the son of Kleaenetus. He has the reputation of having, more than any other man, led the people astray by his impetuosity, and was the first to raise his voice to a shriek from the rostra and indulge in abusive language, and to harangue with his apron on, while everybody else respected the ordinary decencies of public speaking. After them <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a>, the son of <a href=/people/1399 target=_blank>Hagnon</a>, led the other side, while at the head of the people was <a href=/people/1621 target=_blank>Kleophon</a>, the lyre-maker, who first introduced the payment of the two obols. For some time he distributed it, but afterwards <a href=/people/710 target=_blank>Kallikrates</a>, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380239DPai class=demonym long=23.8553 lat=37.9585>Paeanian</a>, put a stop to it, having first promised that he would add another obol to the two obols. Later on they were both condemned to death; for it is the custom of the masses, when they discover that they have been grossly deceived, to hate those who have led them on to do anything that is not right. And from <a href=/people/1621 target=_blank>Kleophon</a> onward the leadership of the people successively passed without interruption to such men as were the most willing to act boldly and gratify the populace, looking only to the immediate present. For of those who conducted the government at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, and succeeded to the old rulers, <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nikias</a> and <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> and <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a> appear to have approved themselves the best. In the case of <a href=/people/115 target=_blank>Nikias</a> and <a href=/people/193 target=_blank>Thucydides</a> almost all agree that they showed themselves to be not only good and honourable men, but also fit to govern, and that they administered the state in every respect in conformity with the national traditions. With regard to <a href=/people/378 target=_blank>Theramenes</a>, however, as disturbances in the forms of government occurred in his time, opinions differ. Still, he seems to such as do not express a mere off-hand opinion, not to have overthrown all these forms, as his accusers charge him with doing, but to have carried on all of them so long as they did not contravene the laws; thus acting like a man who was able to live under any form of government, which is indeed the duty of a good citizen, but who would not be a party to any that was contrary to the law, and so he became an object of hatred. </p>                        </div>

And Kleitophon spoke to the same effect as <a href=/people/1321 target=_blank>Pythodorus</a>, but moved further that those who were elected should examine the long-established laws which <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Kleisthenes</a> passed when he established the democracy, that by listening to them also they might decide on what was best, for they argued that <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Kleisthenes</a>' constitution was not democratic, but on the same lines as that of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>. After their election they first moved that it should be compulsory on the presidents of the Council to put to the vote all proposals about the safety of the state; then they did away with indictments for proposing unconstitutional measures, and in cases not provided for by law, and legal challenges, so that any <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=demonym long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a> who wished might assist in the deliberations about the matters before them.

After this they drew up the constitution as follows: that it should not be lawful to expend the incoming moneys for any other purpose than the war, and that all offices should be held without pay so long as the war might last, with the exception of the nine archons and the presidents of the Council for the time being, but that these should receive three obols a day each.

They annulled in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> the laws of <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a> and <a href=/people/544 target=_blank>Archestratus</a> regarding the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=ethnic long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagitae</a>, and such of <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>'s laws as were of doubtful interpretation, and put down the supreme authority vested in the jurors, as if they were going to restore the constitution, and remove all doubts in its interpretation. For example, in the matter of a man's giving his own property to whom he likes, they gave him full authority once for all; and they removed such difficulties as might arise, except on the grounds of mental aberration, old age, or undue female influence, so that no door might be left open to common informers; in all other cases they proceeded in like manner and with the same object. At first then such was their line of action, and they made away with the common informers and such as associated themselves with the people to do its pleasure in opposition to its true interests, and were mischievous and bad. And men rejoiced at these doings, thinking that they were actuated by the best motives. But when they had got a firmer grip of power, not a single individual did they spare, but killed alike such as were distinguished for their wealth, birth, or rank, getting rid in this underhand way of those whom they were afraid of, and whose property, at the same time, they wished to plunder. By such means they had succeeded within a short period in making away with not less than fifteen hundred persons. </p>                        </div>

In so doing <a href=/people/2149 target=_blank>Archinus</a> seems to have acted like a wise statesman, as well as on a later occasion when he denounced as unlawful the decree of <a href=/people/253 target=_blank>Thrasybulus</a>, by which he was for giving political rights to all those who had returned together from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, since some of them were undoubtedly slaves. In a third instance also he showed his wisdom, when he brought before the Council the first of the restored exiles who had violated the act of amnesty and secured his summary execution, arguing that they had now an opportunity of showing if they intended to maintain the democracy and abide by their oaths, for that if they let this man go they would give encouragement to the rest, but if they put him to death they would make him an example to all. Now, this was just what did come to pass, for on his being put to death nobody ever afterwards violated the amnesty. At the same time they seem in all that they did to have treated their late calamities in the most excellent and statesmanlike way, both individually and as members of the community. For not only did they wholly forego the memory of past wrongs, but they repaid in common to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa class=ethnic long=22.4237 lat=37.0821>Lacedemonians</a> the money which the thirty had got for the war, although their agreement provided that each side, the city and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, should pay separately.

And it appears that the people rightly assumed the supreme authority by reason of its having accomplished unaided the return of the exiles. This change was the eleventh in order. First came the constitution of those who united them into one people at the beginning, viz., <a href=/people/356 target=_blank>Ion</a> and his followers; for it was then for the first time that they were distributed as one people into the four tribes, and that the tribe-kings were appointed. The next and first remarkable form of government after this was that which took shape in the time of <a href=/people/57 target=_blank>Theseus</a>, varying but slightly from the kingly form. After this <a href=/people/1130 target=_blank>Draco</a>'s, in which the laws also were first recorded in writing. Thirdly, <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>'s, after the civil discords, from which dates the beginning of the democracy. Fourthly, the tyranny of <a href=/people/488 target=_blank>Peisistratus</a>. Fifthly, after the overthrow of the tyrants, the constitution of <a href=/people/730 target=_blank>Kleisthenes</a>, more democratic than <a href=/people/76 target=_blank>Solon</a>'s. The sixth was after the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=demonym long=54 lat=29.5>Persian</a> war, when the council of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237LAre class=place long=23.723 lat=37.972>Areopagus</a> presided over the state. Seventh, and following the preceding, was that which <a href=/people/192 target=_blank>Aristides</a> sketched out, and <a href=/people/877 target=_blank>Ephialtes</a> completed, by putting down the Areopagitic council; it was under this constitution that the state, under the leadership of the demagogues, made very many mistakes by reason of its maritime supremacy. The eighth was the constitution of the four hundred, and after this, and ninth, the democracy again. The tenth was the tyranny of the thirty and that of the ten. Eleventh, that after the return of the exiles from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/381236DPhy class=place long=23.637 lat=38.14>Phyle</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, which from its establishment up to the present day has continued uninterruptedly to add further to the power of the masses. For the people itself has made itself master of everything, and administers everything according to its views by its decrees and by its control of the courts of justice, in which it is the supreme power, for even the decisions of the Council come before the people. In this, indeed, they seem to act rightly, for a few are more open to corruption both by bribes and favours than the masses. Now, at first they decided against payment to the Assembly, but when people would not attend it and the presidents had to pass many measures, to secure the presence of the masses for the confirmation of the voting, first <a href=/people/2828 target=_blank>Agyrrhius</a> made the pay an obol, and after him <a href=/people/268 target=_blank>Herakleides</a> of Klazomenae, surnamed the king, two obols, and again <a href=/people/2828 target=_blank>Agyrrhius</a> made it three obols. </p>                        </div>

When they are eighteen years old they are enrolled as members of their deme. When a candidate is proposed, the members of the deme decide by vote about him on oath; first, if they consider him to be of the proper legal age; if they decide against it, he returns to the class of children; and secondly, if he is freeborn and his birth according to the laws. Then, if they decide that he is not freeborn, the candidate appeals to the court of justice, and the members of the deme choose of their number five plaintiffs, and if it is decided that he is not rightly enrolled, the state sells him; but if he gains the day, it is compulsory on the deme to enrol him as a member. After this the Council examines the candidates who have been enrolled, and if any is found to be less than eighteen years old, it fines the members of the deme who enrolled him. When they have passed as Ephebi (i.e., arrived at man's estate), their fathers assemble in their tribes, and on oath select three of their tribesmen above forty years of age, whom they consider to be most worthy and suitable to have charge of the Ephebi, and from them the people votes one of each tribe, selected as their moderator and superintendent in everything from the whole body of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. And, taking charge of the Ephebi, first they make a circuit of the sacred places, then they proceed to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379236HPei class=place long=23.6448 lat=37.9394>Peiraeus</a>, and some of the Ephebi garrison <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379237HMou class=place long=23.658 lat=37.938>Munychia</a>, and the rest the shore. The people votes them also two gymnastic-masters and teachers, who instruct them in the use of arms, shooting, hurling, and working the catapult. It gives for maintenance to the moderators a drachma a day each, and to the Ephebi four obols each.

Cases up to ten drachmae they have full power to decide, but such as are above this amount they pass over to the arbitrators. These take them over, and if they are unable to effect a settlement, state their opinions, and if both sides are satisfied with their recommendations and abide by them, the suit is at an end. But if one of the parties appeals to the court, they put the evidence and challenges and laws into vases, using a separate vase both for the plaintiff and the defendant, and signing and sealing them, with the judgment of the arbitrator recorded on a tablet attached, they hand them over to the adjudicators of the tribe to which the defendant belongs. These adjudicators take them over and bring them into the court, which is composed of two hundred and one for amounts within a thousand drachmae, and of four hundred and one for amounts above a thousand. They are not allowed to make use of any laws or challenges or evidence other than what is received from the arbitrator and contained in the vases. Arbitrators must be sixty years of age; and this is evident from the archons and Eponymi. For there are ten Eponymi of the tribes and forty-two of the ages, and the Ephebi in former days at the time of their enrolment had their names registered on white tablets, and the name of the archon in whose time they were enrolled was added to the register as well as that of the <a href=/people/9340 target=_blank>Eponymus</a> who had acted as arbitrator in the previous year; but now their names are inscribed on a brass pillar, and the pillar stands before the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237BBol class=place long=23.7218 lat=37.975183>Bouleuterion</a> near the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SEpH class=place long=23.72239 lat=37.975104>statues of the ten Eponymi</a> of the tribes. And the forty, taking the last one of the Eponymi, assign the arbitrations to them, and by lot in what cases each shall act. For the law ordains forfeiture of political rights in the case of anyone of the proper age failing to act as arbitrator, unless he happens to be filling any other office, or to be abroad; in such cases only is exemption granted. Anyone who has been wronged by an arbitrator is free to indict him before the jurors, but if their verdict goes against him he loses his political rights, as the laws ordain; but even then there is the right of appeal. They make use also of the names of the Eponymi with regard to military expeditions, and when they send out a body of young men, they publicly notify from and up to what archon and <a href=/people/9340 target=_blank>Eponymus</a> they are to serve. </p>                        </div>

But now they appoint by lot six <a href=/people/1119 target=_blank>Thesmothetae</a> and a secretary for them, and further, an archon and king and commander-in-chief severally from each tribe. And they are first examined in the Council by the five hundred, except the secretary, who is examined only in the court just like all other officers of state (for all who are appointed either by lot or vote hold office only after examination), but the nine archons are examined before the Council and again in court. In former days no one could hold office if he were rejected by the Council, but now there is appeal to the court, and with it rests the decision regarding the examination. The questions asked in the examination are as follows: First, who is your father, and of what deme? and who your father's father, and who your mother, and who your mother's father, and of what deme? and, after this, if he has an <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SPtr class=place long=23.7221 lat=37.97554>Patroos</a> and <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> <a href=/people/3608 target=_blank>Herkeios</a>, and where their shrines are; then, if he has grave plots, and where they are; and, last, if he treats his parents well, and pays his taxes (or performs the rites?), and has duly performed his military service. Having asked these questions, the examiner says, 'Call your witnesses to these facts.' When the witnesses are produced he asks further, 'Has anyone any accusation to bring against this man?' and if no one comes forward, after giving opportunity for accusation and defence, he proposes the show of hands in the Council and in the court the vote. And if no one wants to accuse, he at once gives his vote. Formerly one only put his pebble into the urn, but now all must do so. Further, the right exists of passing a vote about them with the object, if any bad man gets his accusers out of the way, of putting it in the power of the jurors to reject him.

A vote is passed in each presidency as to their conduct in office; if it is adverse, the trial is held in court, and in case of conviction a proper punishment or fine is awarded; while in case of acquittal, the accused continues in office for the remainder of his term. They have the power when on service of placing under arrest anyone not conforming to discipline, and publicly proclaiming his name, and inflicting a fine; to the last however they rarely resort. They appoint also by vote ten commanders of divisions, one for each tribe, and he commands his tribesmen and appoints captains, and further two commanders of cavalry out of the whole body of citizens. These take command of the knights, five tribes being assigned to each, and are invested with the same powers as the generals possess in the case of the hoplites, while in their case also a vote is passed on their conduct. They appoint by lot also chiefs of tribes, one for the tribe, to command the knights in the same way as commanders of divisions do the hoplites.
