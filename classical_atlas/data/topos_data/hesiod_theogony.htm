For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a>. Great honour comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favourably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of <a href=/people/43 target=_blank>Cronos</a> did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former <a href=/people/206 target=_blank>Titan</a> gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea. Also, because she is an only child, the goddess receives not less honour, but much more still, for <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a> honours her. Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to <a href=/people/409 target=_blank>Hecate</a> and the loud-crashing <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Earth-Shaker</a>, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will.

From his shoulders grew an hundred heads of a <a href=/people/55 target=_blank>snake</a>, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a> bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a <a href=/people/10960 target=_blank>lion</a>, relentless of heart; and at anothers, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed. And truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men and gods been quick to perceive it.
