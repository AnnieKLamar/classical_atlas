This is the same air that heard thee say it; and after all thou turnest round and hast been caught recasting thy letter to this effect, I will no longer be my daughter's murderer. Exactly so! Countless others have gone through this phase in their conduct of public affairs; they make an effort while in power, and then retire dishonourably, sometimes owing to the senselessness of the citizens, sometimes deservedly, because they are too feeble of themselves to maintain their watch upon the state. For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy Hellas, whose purpose was to read these worthless foreigners a lesson, while now she will let them escape and mock her, thanks to thee and thy daughter. May I never then appoint a man to rule my country or lead its warriors because his kinship!

Then, when those two sons of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, who were likewise my brothers, came flashing on horseback to war with thee, <a href=/people/362 target=_blank>Tyndareus</a>, my aged sire, rescued thee because of thy suppliant prayers, and thou in turn hadst me to wife. Once reconciled to thee upon this footing, thou wilt bear me witness I have been a blameless wife to thee and thy family, chaste in love, an honour to thy house, that so thy coming in might be with joy and thy going out with gladness. And 'tis seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless woman is no rarity. Besides three daughters, of one of whom thou art heartlessly depriving me, I am the mother of this son of thine. </p>                        </div>

As soon as we reached the grove of <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, the child of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, and the flowery meadows, where the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=demonym long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaean</a> troops were gathered, bringing your daughter with us, at once the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> army began assembling; but when king <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by her father, spoke thus: O my father, here I am; willingly I offer my body for my country and all Hellas, that you may lead me to the altar of the goddess and sacrifice me, since this is Heaven's ordinance. May good luck be yours for any help that I afford! and may you obtain the victor's gift and come again to the land of your fathers. So then let none of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a> lay hands on me, for I will bravely yield my neck without a word. </p>                        </div>

Then the son of <a href=/people/109 target=_blank>Peleus</a>, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess uttering these words: O <a href=/people/28 target=_blank>Artemis</a>, you child of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Zeus</a>, slayer of wild beasts, that wheel your dazzling light amid the gloom, accept this sacrifice which we, the army of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/382219RAch class=ethnic long=21.9 lat=38.2>Achaeans</a> and <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a> with us, offer to you, pure blood from a beautiful maiden's neck; and grant us safe sailing for our ships and the sack of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/400262UIli class=place long=26.2389 lat=39.9575>Troy</a>'s towers by our spears.

Each one of us distinctly heard the sound of a blow, but none saw the spot where the maiden vanished. The priest cried out, and all the army took up the cry at the sight of a marvel all unlooked for, due to some god's agency, and passing all belief, although it was seen; for there upon the ground lay a deer of immense size, magnificent to see, gasping out her life, with whose blood the altar of the goddess was thoroughly bedewed. </p>                        </div>
