While the siege of the city was in progress, he made an expedition against the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra class=ethnic long=40 lat=28>Arabians</a> who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/335359LALi class=place long=35.9447 lat=33.5204>Antilibanus</a>. On this expedition he risked his life to save his tutor, <a href=/people/123 target=_blank>Lysimachus</a>, who insisted on following him, declaring himself to be neither older nor weaker than <a href=/people/569 target=_blank>Phoenix</a>.

Before he was aware of it, therefore, he was separated from the army with a few followers, and had to spend a night of darkness and intense cold in a region that was rough and difficult. In this plight, he saw far off a number of scattered fires which the enemy were burning. So, since he was confident in his own agility, and was ever wont to cheer the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak class=ethnic long=22.5 lat=40.81>Macedonians</a> in their perplexities by sharing their toils, he ran to the nearest camp-fire.

However, the seers exhorted him to be of good cheer, since the city here founded by him would have most abundant and helpful resources and be a nursing mother for men of every nation, and so he ordered those in charge of the work to proceed with it, while he himself set out for the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm class=place long=25.5435 lat=29.2052>temple of Ammon</a>.

Even as it was, they had great difficulty in putting out the fire, for it covered the boy's whole body, and after they had done so, he was in a sorry plight. It is natural, then, that some who wish to bring fable into conformity with truth should say that this naphtha is the drug which <a href=/people/165 target=_blank>Medeia</a> used, when, in the tragedies, she anoints the crown and the robe. For it was not from these objects themselves, they say, nor of its own accord, that the fire shot up, but a flame was placed near them, which was then so swiftly drawn into conjunction with them that the sense could not take cognisance of it. For the rays and emanations of fire which come from a distance impart to some bodies merely light and warmth; but in those which are dry and porous, or which have sufficiently rich moisture, they collect themselves together, break into fierce flame, and transform the material. There has been much discussion about the origin of . . . . or whether rather the liquid substance that feeds the flame flows out from a soil which is rich and productive of fire. For the soil of <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a> is very fiery, so that grains of barley often leap out of the ground and bound away, as if its inflammation made the ground throb; and the inhabitants, during the hot season, sleep on skins filled with water. <a href=/people/477 target=_blank>Harpalus</a>, moreover, when he was left as overseer of the country and was eager to adorn the royal gardens and walks with Hellenic plants, succeeded with all except ivy; this the soil would not support, but always killed it. The plant could not endure the temper of the soil, for the soil was fiery, while the plant was fond of coolness. However, if such digressions are kept within bounds, perhaps my impatient readers will find less fault with them. </p>                        </div>

But <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, fearing the elephants and the great numbers of the enemy, himself assaulted their left wing, and ordered <a href=/people/1169 target=_blank>Coenus</a> to attack their right. Both wings having been routed, the vanquished troops retired in every case upon the elephants in the centre, and were there crowded together with them, and from this point on the battle was waged at close quarters, and it was not until the eighth hour that the enemy gave up. Such then, is the account of the battle which the victor himself has given in his letters. Most historians agree that <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> was four cubits and a span high, and that the size and majesty of his body made his elephant seem as fitting a mount for him as a <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a> for the horseman. And yet his elephant was of the largest size; and it showed remarkable intelligence and solicitude for the king, bravely defending him and beating back his assailants while he was still in full vigour, and when it perceived that its master was worn out with a multitude of missiles and wounds, fearing he should fall off, it knelt softly on the ground, and with its proboscis gently took each spear and drew it out of his body. <a href=/people/415 target=_blank>Porus</a> was taken prisoner, and when <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> asked him how he would be treated, said: Like a king; and to another question from <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> whether he had anything else to say, replied: All things are included in my 'like a king.' Accordingly, <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a> not only permitted him to govern his former kingdom, giving him the title of satrap, but also added to it the territory of the independent peoples whom he subdued, in which there are said to have been fifteen nations, five thousand cities of considerable size, and a great multitude of villages. He subdued other territory also thrice as large as this and appointed <a href=/people/26 target=_blank>Philip</a>, one of his companions, satrap over it. </p>                        </div>
