I Promised to write of the rise, progress, and appointed end of the two cities, one of which is God's, the other this world's, in which, so far as mankind is concerned, the former is now a stranger. But first of all I undertook, so far as His grace should enable me, to refute the enemies of the city of God, who prefer their gods to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> its founder, and fiercely hate <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> with the most deadly malice. And this I have done in the first ten books. Then, as regards my threefold promise which I have just mentioned, I have treated distinctly, in the four books which follow the tenth, of the rise of both cities. After that, I have proceeded from the first man down to the flood in one book, which is the fifteenth of this work; and from that again down to <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> our work has followed both in chronological order. From the patriarch <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> down to the time of the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelite</a> kings, at which we close our sixteenth book, and thence down to the advent of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Himself in the flesh, to which period the seventeenth book reaches. the city of God appears from my way of writing to have run its course alone; whereas it did not run its course alone in this age, for both cities, in their course amid mankind, certainly experienced chequered times together just as from the beginning. But I did this in order that, first of all, from the time when the promises of God began to be more clear, down to the virgin birth of Him in whom those things promised from the first were to be fulfilled, the course of that city which is God's might be made more distinctly apparent, without interpolation of foreign matter from the history of the other city, although down to the revelation of the new covenant it ran its course, not in light, but in shadow. Now, therefore, I think fit to do what I passed by, and show, so far as seems necessary, how that other city ran its course from the times of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, so that attentive readers may compare the two. </p>                        </div>

The society of mortals spread abroad through the earth everywhere, and in the most diverse places, although bound together by a certain fellowship of our common nature, is yet for the most part divided against itself, and the strongest oppress the others, because all follow after their own interests and lusts, while what is longed for either suffices for none, or not for all, because it is not the very thing. For the vanquished succumb to the victorious, preferring any sort of peace and safety to freedom itself; so that they who chose to die rather than be slaves have been greatly wondered at. For in almost all nations the very voice of nature somehow proclaims, that those who happen to be conquered should choose rather to be subject to their conquerors than to be killed by all kinds of warlike destruction. This does not take place without the providence of God, in whose power it lies that any one either subdues or is subdued in war; that some are endowed with kingdoms, others made subject to kings. Now, among the very many kingdoms of the earth into which, by earthly interest or lust, society is divided (which we call by the general name of the city of this world), we see that two, settled and kept distinct from each other both in time and place, have grown far more famous than the rest, first that of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, then that of the Romans. First came the one, then the other. The former arose in the east, and, immediately on its close, the latter in the west. I may speak of other kingdoms and other kings as appendages of these. <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>, then, who succeeded his father <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a>, the first king of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>, was already the second king of that kingdom when <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was born in the land of the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldees</a>. There was also at that time a very small kingdom of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a>, with which, as from an ancient date, that most universally learned man Marcus <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> begins, in writing of the Roman race. For from these kings of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a> he passes to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, from them to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, and from these to the Romans. Yet very little is related about these kingdoms, before the foundation of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, in comparison with that of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>. For although even <a href=/people/926 target=_blank>Sallust</a>, the Roman historian, admits that the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were very famous in Greece, yet he thinks they were greater in fame than in fact. For in speaking of them he says, The deeds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, as I think, were very great and magnificent, but yet somewhat less than reported by fame. But because writers of great genius arose among them, the deeds of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> were celebrated throughout the world as very great. Thus the virtue of those who did them was held to be as great as men of transcendent genius could represent it to be by the power of laudatory words. This city also derived no small glory from literature and philosophy, the study of which chiefly flourished there. But as regards empire, none in the earliest times was greater than the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a>, or so widely extended. For when <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> the son of <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> was king, he is reported to have subdued the whole of Asia, even to the boundaries of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300070RLib class=place long=10.01 lat=32.01>Libya</a>, which as to number is called the third part, but as to size is found to be the half of the whole world. The <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=ethnic long=74 lat=30>Indians</a> in the eastern regions were the only people over whom he did not reign; but after his death <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a> his wife made war on them. Thus it came to pass that all the people and kings in those countries were subject to the kingdom and authority of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, and did whatever they were commanded. Now <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was born in that kingdom among the <a href=/people/1042 target=_blank>Chaldees</a>, in the time of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a>. But since Grecian affairs are much better known to us than <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a>, and those who have diligently investigated the antiquity of the Roman nation's origin have followed the order of time through the Greeks to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, and from them to the Romans, who themselves are <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>, we ought on this account, where it is needful, to mention the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kings, that it may appear how <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, like a first <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, ran its course along with the city of God, which is a stranger in this world. But the things proper for insertion in this work in comparing the two cities, that is, the earthly and heavenly, ought to be taken mostly from the Greek and Latin kingdoms, where <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> herself is like a second <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. At <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>'s birth, then, the second kings of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a> and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a> respectively were <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and <a href=/people/3309 target=_blank>Europs</a>, the first having been <a href=/people/575 target=_blank>Belus</a> and <a href=/people/1499 target=_blank>Aegialeus</a>. But when God promised <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, on his departure from <a href=/people/471 target=_blank>Babylonia</a>, that he should become a great nation, and that in his seed all nations of the earth should be blessed, the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a> had their seventh king, the <a href=/people/6919 target=_blank>Sikyons</a> their fifth; for the son of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> reigned among them after his mother <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, who is said to have been put to death by him for attempting to defile him by incestuously lying with him. Some think that she founded <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and indeed she may have founded it anew. But we have told, in the sixteenth book, when or by whom it was founded. Now the son of <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> and <a href=/people/332 target=_blank>Semiramis</a>, who succeeded his mother in the kingdom, is also called <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> by some, but by others Ninias, a patronymic word. Telexion then held the kingdom of the <a href=/people/6919 target=_blank>Sikyons</a>. In his reign times were quiet and joyful to such a degree, that after his death they worshipped him as a god by offering sacrifices and by celebrating games, which are said to have been first instituted on this occasion. </p>                        </div>

In his times also, by the promise of God, <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a>, the son of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, was born to his father when he was a hundred years old, of Sarah his wife, who, being barren and old, had already lost hope of issue. Aralius was then the fifth king of the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>. To <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> himself, in his sixtieth year, were born twin-sons, <a href=/people/4143 target=_blank>Esau</a> and <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>, whom <a href=/people/6872 target=_blank>Rebecca</a> his wife bore to him, their grandfather <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, who died on completing a hundred and seventy years, being still alive, and reckoning his hundred and sixtieth year. At that time there reigned as the seventh kings,-among the <a href=/people/196 target=_blank>Assyrians</a>, that more ancient <a href=/people/56 target=_blank>Xerxes</a>, who was also called <a href=/people/5496 target=_blank>Balaeus</a>; and among the <a href=/people/6919 target=_blank>Sikyons</a>, <a href=/people/10400 target=_blank>Thuriachus</a>, or, as some write his name, <a href=/people/4804 target=_blank>Thurimachus</a>.

And I must not omit what <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> relates, that the <a href=/people/6919 target=_blank>Sikyons</a> were also wont to sacrifice at the tomb of their seventh king <a href=/people/10400 target=_blank>Thuriachus</a>.

These same things were promised to his son, <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>'s grandson, who was at first called <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>, afterwards <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, when Belocus was the ninth king of <a href=/people/454 target=_blank>Assyria</a>, and <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, the son of <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a>, reigned as the second king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>, <a href=/people/935 target=_blank>Leucippus</a> still continuing king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380227PSik class=place long=22.7145 lat=37.9834>Sikyon</a>. In those times, under the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=demonym long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argive</a> king <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, Greece was made more famous by the institution of certain laws and judges. On the death of <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, his younger brother <a href=/people/10909 target=_blank>Phegous</a> built a temple at his tomb, in which he was worshipped as God, and <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> were sacrificed to him. I believe they thought him worthy of so great honor, because in his part of the kingdom (for their father had divided his territories between them, in which they reigned daring his life) he had founded chapels for the worship of the gods, and had taught them to measure time, by months and years, and to that extent to keep count and reckoning of events. Men still uncultivated, admiring him for these novelties, either fancied he was, or resolved that he should be made, a god after his death. <a href=/people/389 target=_blank>Io</a> also is said to have been the daughter of <a href=/people/684 target=_blank>Inachus</a>, who was afterwards called <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a>, when she was worshipped in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> as a great goddess; although others write that she came as a queen out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>, and because she ruled extensively and justly, and instituted for her subjects letters and many useful things, such divine honor was given her there after she died, that it any one said she had been human, he was charged with a capital crime. </p>                        </div>

On this account the king made him ruler over <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, liberating him from prison, into which he had been thrown for keeping his chastity intact; for he bravely preserved it from his mistress, who wickedly loved him, and told lies to his weakly credulous master, and did not consent to commit adultery with her, but fled from her, leaving his garment in her hands when she laid hold of him.

Now <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> gives this very ready reason why, after his death, he was called, not <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a>, but <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a>. The ark in which he was placed when dead, which every one now calls a sarcophagus, was then called in Greek, and they began to worship him when buried in it before his temple was built; and from Soros and <a href=/people/360 target=_blank>Apis</a> he was called first [Sorosapis, or] Sorapis, and then <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a>, by changing a letter, as easily happens. It was decreed regarding him also, that whoever should say he had been a man should be capitally punished. And since in every temple where <a href=/people/157 target=_blank>Isis</a> and <a href=/people/646 target=_blank>Serapis</a> were worshipped there was also an image which, with finger pressed on the lips, seemed to warn men to keep silence, <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> thinks this signifies that it should be kept secret that they had been human.

On the death of that <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, when they sought and found a calf of the same color,-that is, similarly marked with certain white spots,-they believed it was something miraculous, and divinely provided for them. Yet it was no great thing for the demons, in order to deceive them, to show to a <a href=/people/10978 target=_blank>cow</a> when she was conceiving and pregnant the image of such a <a href=/people/10955 target=_blank>bull</a>, which she alone could see, and by it attract the breeding passion of the mother, so that it might appear in a bodily shape in her young, just as <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> so managed with the spotted rods that the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> and <a href=/people/10956 target=_blank>goats</a> were born spotted.

Some have thought that <a href=/people/254 target=_blank>Prometheus</a> lived during the reign of the kings now named. He is reported to have formed men out of clay, because he was esteemed the best teacher of wisdom; yet it does not appear what wise men there were in his days. His brother <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> is said to have been a great astrologer; and this gave occasion for the fable that he held up the sky, although the vulgar opinion about his holding up the sky appears rather to have been suggested by a high mountain named after him. Indeed, from those times many other fabulous things began to be invented in Greece; yet, down to <a href=/people/447 target=_blank>Cecrops</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in whose reign that city received its name, and in whose reign God brought His people out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> by <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, only a few dead heroes are reported to have been deified according to the vain superstition of the Greeks. Among these were Melantomice, the wife of king <a href=/people/6391 target=_blank>Criasus</a>, and <a href=/people/854 target=_blank>Phorbas</a> their son, who succeeded his father as sixth king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=ethnic long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argives</a>, and <a href=/people/2319 target=_blank>Iasus</a>, son of <a href=/people/1413 target=_blank>Triopas</a>, their seventh king, and their ninth king, <a href=/people/5357 target=_blank>Sthenelas</a>, or Stheneleus, or <a href=/people/844 target=_blank>Sthenelus</a>,-for his name is given differently by different authors. In those times also, <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>, the grandson of <a href=/people/190 target=_blank>Atlas</a> by his daughter <a href=/people/525 target=_blank>Maia</a>, is said to have lived, according to the common report in books. He was famous for his skill in many arts, and taught them to men, for which they resolved to make him, and even believed that he deserved to be, a god after death. <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> is said to have been later, yet belonging to the same period; although some, whom I think mistaken, assign him an earlier date than <a href=/people/33 target=_blank>Mercury</a>. But at whatever time they were born, it is agreed among grave historians, who have committed these ancient things to writing, that both were men, and that they merited divine honors from mortals because they conferred on them many benefits to make this life more pleasant to them. <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> was far more ancient than these; for she is reported to have appeared in virgin age in the times of <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a> at the lake called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/000000WTri class=place long=19 lat=30.14>Lake Triton</a>, from which she is also styled Tritonia, the inventress truly of many works, and the more readily believed to be a goddess because her origin was so little known. For what is sung about her having sprung from the head of <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> belongs to the region of poetry and fable, and not to that of history and real fact. And historical writers are not agreed when <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a> flourished, in whose time also a great flood occurred,-not that greatest one from which no man escaped except those who could get into the ark, for neither Greek nor Latin history knew of it, yet a greater flood than that which happened afterward in <a href=/people/10993 target=_blank>Deucalion</a>'s time. For <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> begins the book I have already mentioned at this date, and does not propose to himself, as the starting-point from which he may arrive at Roman affairs, anything more ancient than the flood of <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a>, that is, which happened in the time of <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a>. Now our writers of chronicles-first <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a>, and afterwards <a href=/people/5722 target=_blank>Jerome</a>, who entirely follow some earlier historians in this opinion-relate that the flood of <a href=/people/2134 target=_blank>Ogyges</a> happened more than three hundred years after, during the reign of <a href=/people/817 target=_blank>Phoroneus</a>, the second king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg class=place long=22.7195 lat=37.6316>Argos</a>.

When an olive-tree suddenly appeared there, and water burst forth in another place, these prodigies moved the king to send to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/385225SDel class=person long=22.50108 lat=38.48264>Delphic</a> <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a> to inquire what they meant and what he should do. He answered that the olive signified <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, the water <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, and that the citizens had it in their power to name their city as they chose, after either of these two gods whose signs these were. On receiving this oracle, <a href=/people/447 target=_blank>Cecrops</a> convoked all the citizens of either sex to give their vote, for it was then the custom in those parts for the women also to take part in public deliberations. When the multitude was consulted, the men gave their votes for <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, the women for <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>; and as the women had a majority of one, <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> conquered. Then <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a>, being enraged, laid waste the lands of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, by casting up the waves of the sea; for the demons have no difficulty in scattering any waters more widely. The same authority said, that to appease his wrath the women should be visited by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a> with the three-fold punishment-that they should no longer have any vote; that none of their children should be named after their mothers; and that no one should call them <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>. Thus that city, the mother and nurse of liberal doctrines, and of so many and so great philosophers, than whom Greece had noticing more famous and noble, by the mockery of demons about the strife of their gods, a male and female, and from the victory of the female one through the women, received the name of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>; and, on being damaged by the vanquished god, was compelled to punish the very victory of the victress, fearing the waters of <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> more than the arms of <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>. For in the women who were thus punished, <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, who had conquered, was conquered too, and could not even help her voters so far that, although the right of voting was henceforth lost, and the mothers could not give their names to the children, they might at least be allowed to be called <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, and to merit the name of that goddess whom they had made victorious over a male god by giving her their votes. What and how much could be said about this, if we had not to hasten to other things in our discourse, is obvious. </p>                        </div>

For even the <a href=/people/12178 target=_blank>Luperci</a>, when they ascend and descend the sacred path, are said to represent the men who sought the mountain summits because of the inundation of water, and returned to the lowlands on its subsidence. In those times, <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Dionysus</a>, who was also called <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Father Liber</a>, and was esteemed a god after death, is said to have shown the vine to his host in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>.

But king <a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Ericthonius</a> first instituted games to him in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/379239RAtt class=place long=23.9 lat=37.9>Attica</a>, and not to him only, but also to <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, in which games the olive was given as the prize to the victors, because they relate that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> was the discoverer of that fruit, as <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Liber</a> was of the grape.

In those times <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a> was held in honor in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr class=place long=35.196 lat=33.272>Tyre</a>, but that was not the same one as he whom we spoke of above. In the more secret history there are said to have been several who were called <a href=/people/5 target=_blank>Father Liber</a> and <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>. This <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, whose great deeds are reckoned as twelve (not including the slaughter of <a href=/people/931 target=_blank>Antaeus</a> the African, because that affair pertains to another <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>), is declared in their books to have burned himself on Mount (Eta, because he was not able, by that strength with which he had subdued monsters, to endure the disease under which he languished.

Now it must not be believed that <a href=/people/25 target=_blank>Neptune</a> committed this adultery, lest the gods should be criminated; yet such things must be ascribed to them by the poets and in the theatres, that they may be pleased with them. <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> are said to have been the parents of <a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Ericthonius</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, in whose last years <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> the son of Nun is found to have died. But since they will have it that <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> is a virgin, they say that <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a>, being disturbed in the struggle between them, poured out his seed into the earth, and on that account the man born of it received that name; for in the Greek language Eris is strife, and chthonos earth, of which two words <a href=/people/913 target=_blank>Ericthonius</a> is a compound. Yet it must be admitted that the more learned disprove and disown such things concerning their gods, and declare that this fabulous belief originated in the fact that in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237SHep class=place long=23.7214 lat=37.9756>temple</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=place long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athens</a>, which <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a> had in common, a boy who had been exposed was found wrapped up in the coils of a dragon, which signified that he would become great, and, as his parents were unknown, he was called the son of <a href=/people/84 target=_blank>Vulcan</a> and <a href=/people/11 target=_blank>Minerva</a>, because they had the temple in common. Yet that fable accounts for the origin of his name better than this history. But what does it matter to us? Let the one in books that speak the truth edify religious men, and the other in lying fables delight impure demons. Yet these religious men worship them as gods. Still, while they deny these things concerning them they cannot clear them of all crime, because at their demand they exhibit plays in which the very things they wisely deny are basely done, and the gods are appeased by these false and base things. Now, even although the play celebrates an unreal crime of the gods, yet to delight in the ascription of an unreal crime is a real one. </p>                        </div>

And yet they willingly accepted them, when, indeed, the more devotedly they worshipped <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a>, they ought the more severely to have punished those who durst say such things of him. But they not only were not angry at those who invented these things, but were afraid that the gods would be angry at them if they did not act such fictions even in the theatres. In those times <a href=/people/127 target=_blank>Latona</a> bore <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>, not him of whose oracle we have spoken above as so often consulted, but him who is said, along with <a href=/people/4 target=_blank>Hercules</a>, to have fed the flocks of king <a href=/people/996 target=_blank>Admetus</a>; yet he was so believed to be a god, that very many, indeed almost all, have believed him to be the selfsame <a href=/people/2 target=_blank>Apollo</a>.

And if, among much that was vain and false, they sang anything of the one true God, yet, by worshipping Him along with others who are not gods, and showing them the service that is due to Him alone, they did not serve Him at all rightly; and even such poets as <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, <a href=/people/905 target=_blank>Musaeus</a>, and <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a>, were unable to abstain from dishonoring their gods by fables.

For this prophetic precept is to be understood spiritually in this sense, that by going forward in the living God, by the steps of faith, which worketh by love, we must flee out of the city of this world, which is altogether a society of ungodly angels and men. Yea, the greater we see the power of the demons to be in these depths, so much the more tenaciously must we cleave to the Mediator through whom we ascend from these lowest to the highest places. For if we should say these things are not to be credited, there are not wanting even now some who would affirm that they had either heard on the best authority, or even themselves experienced, something of that kind. Indeed we ourselves, when in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/406163RIta class=place long=16.3 lat=40.6>Italy</a>, heard such things about a certain region there where landladies of inns, imbued with these wicked arts, were said to be in the habit of giving to such travellers as they chose, or could manage, something in a piece of cheese by which they were changed on the spot into beasts of burden, and carried whatever was necessary, and were restored to their own form when the work was done. Yet their mind did not become bestial, but remained rational and human, just as <a href=/people/2034 target=_blank>Apuleius</a>, in the books he wrote with the title of The Golden <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>Ass</a>, has told, or feigned, that it happened to his own self that, on taking poison, he became an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, while retaining his human mind. <br />These things are either false, or so extraordinary as to be with good reason disbelieved. But it is to be most firmly believed that Almighty God can do whatever He pleases, whether in punishing or favoring, and that the demons can accomplish nothing by their natural power (for their created being is itself angelic, although made malign by their own fault), except what He may permit, whose judgments are often hidden, but never unrighteous. And indeed the demons, if they really do such things as these on which this discussion turns, do not create real substances, but only change the appearance of things created by the true God so as to make them seem to be what they are not. I cannot therefore believe that even the body, much less the mind, can really be changed into bestial forms and lineaments by any reason, art, or power of the demons; but the phantasm of a man which even in thought or dreams goes through innumerable changes may, when the man's senses are laid asleep or overpowered, be presented to the senses of others in a corporeal form, in some indescribable way unknown to me, so that men's bodies themselves may lie somewhere, alive, indeed, yet with their senses locked up much more heavily and firmly than by sleep, while that phantasm, as it were embodied in the shape of some animal, may appear to the senses of others, and may even seem to the man himself to be changed, just as he may seem to himself in sleep to be so changed, and to bear burdens; and these burdens, if they are real substances, are borne by the demons, that men may be deceived by beholding at the same time the real substance of the burdens and the simulated bodies of the beasts of burden. For a certain man called Praestantius used to tell that it had happened to his father in his own house, that he took that poison in a piece of cheese, and lay in his bed as if sleeping, yet could by no means be aroused. But he said that after a few days he as it were woke up and related the things he had suffered as if they had been dreams, namely, that he had been made a sumpter <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horse</a>, and, along with other beasts of burden, had carried provisions for the soldiers of what is called the Rhoetian Legion, because it was sent to <a about=https://topostext.org/place/469105RRae class=place long=10.47 lat=46.85>Rhoetia</a>. And all this was found to have taken place just as he told, yet it had seemed to him to be his own dream. And another man declared that in his own house at night, before he slept, he saw a certain philosopher, whom he knew very well, come to him and explain to him some things in the Platonic philosophy which he had previously declined to explain when asked. And when he had asked this philosopher why he did in his house what he had refused to do at home, he said, I did not do it, but I dreamed I had done it. And thus what the one saw when sleeping was shown to the other when awake by a phantasmal image. These things have not come to us from persons we might deem unworthy of credit, but from informants we could not suppose to be deceiving us. Therefore what men say and have committed to writing about the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=ethnic long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadians</a> being often changed into <a href=/people/10952 target=_blank>wolves</a> by the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/375223RArk class=demonym long=22.3 lat=37.5>Arcadian</a> gods, or demons rather, and what is told in song about <a href=/people/245 target=_blank>Circe</a> transforming the companions of <a href=/people/18 target=_blank>Ulysses</a>, if they were really done, may, in my opinion, have been done in the way I have said. As for <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a>'s birds, since their race is alleged to have been perpetuated by constant propagation, I believe they were not made through the metamorphosis of men, but were slyly substituted for them on their removal, just as the hind was for <a href=/people/708 target=_blank>Iphigenia</a>, the daughter of king <a href=/people/47 target=_blank>Agamemnon</a>. For juggleries of this kind could not be difficult for the demons if permitted by the judgment of God; and since that virgin was afterwards, found alive it is easy to see that a hind had been slyly substituted for her. But because the companions of <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a> were of a sudden nowhere to be seen, and afterwards could nowhere be found, being destroyed by bad avenging angels, they were believed to have been changed into those birds, which were secretly brought there from other places where such birds were, and suddenly substituted for them by fraud. But that they bring water in their beaks and sprinkle it on the temple of <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a>, and that they fawn on men of Greek race and persecute aliens, is no wonderful thing to be done by the inward influence of the demons, whose interest it is to persuade men that <a href=/people/124 target=_blank>Diomede</a> was made a god, and thus to beguile them into worshipping many false gods, to the great dishonor of the true God; and to serve dead men, who even in their lifetime did not truly live, with temples, altars, sacrifices, and priests, all which, when of the right kind, are due only to the one living and true God. </p>                        </div>

Yet what wonder is it, if, to rebuke the king who had cruelly ordered them to be thrown into the water, God was pleased, after divinely delivering them from the water, to succor, by means of a wild beast giving milk, these infants by whom so great a city was to be rounded? <a href=/people/795 target=_blank>Amulius</a> was succeeded in the Latian kingdom by his brother <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>, the grandfather of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>; and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was rounded in the first year of this <a href=/people/772 target=_blank>Numitor</a>, who from that time reigned along with his grandson <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>. </p>                        </div>

To be brief, the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> was rounded, like another <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, and as it were the daughter of the former <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, by which God was pleased to conquer the whole world, and subdue it far and wide by bringing it into one fellowship of government and laws. For there were already powerful and brave peoples and nations trained to arms, who did not easily yield, and whose subjugation necessarily involved great danger and destruction as well as great and horrible labor. For when the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kingdom subdued almost all Asia, although this was done by fighting, yet the wars could not be very fierce or difficult, because the nations were as yet untrained to resist, and neither so many nor so great as afterward; forasmuch as, after that greatest and indeed universal flood, when only eight men escaped in <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a>'s ark, not much more than a thousand years had passed when <a href=/people/602 target=_blank>Ninus</a> subdued all Asia with the exception of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd class=place long=74 lat=30>India</a>.

Of these years twenty-seven belong to <a href=/people/1703 target=_blank>Joshua</a> the son of Nun, and after that three hundred and twenty-nine to the period of the judges. But from the time when the kings began to reign there, three hundred and sixty-two years had passed. And at that time there was a king in <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> called Ahaz, or, as others compute, <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a> his successor, the best and most pious king, who it is admitted reigned in the times of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>.

Some say the <a href=/people/886 target=_blank>Erythraean</a> sibyl prophesied at this time. Now <a href=/people/10949 target=_blank>Varro</a> declares there were many sibyls, and not merely one. This sibyl of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=place long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythrae</a> certainly wrote some things concerning <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> which are quite manifest, and we first read them in the Latin tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical, through the unskillfulness, as we afterwards learned, of some interpreter unknown to me. For <a href=/people/5667 target=_blank>Flaccianus</a>, a very famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man of most ready eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the prophecies of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=demonym long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraean</a> sibyl, in which he pointed out a certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so arranged that these words could be read in them: ΙΧΘΥΣ, which means, Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the Son of God, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>. And these verses, of which the initial letters yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated by some one into Latin in good rhythm: Judgment shall moisten the earth with the sweat of its standard, Ever enduring, behold the King shall come through the ages, Sent to be here in the flesh, and Judge at the last of the world. O God, the believing and faithless alike shall behold Thee Uplifted with saints, when at last the ages are ended. Seated before Him are souls in the flesh for His judgment. Hid in thick vapors, the while desolate lieth the earth. Rejected by men are the idols and longhidden treasures; <a href=/people/3304 target=_blank>Earth</a> is consumed by the fire, and it searcheth the ocean and heaven; Issuing forth, it destroyeth the terrible portals of hell. Saints in their body and soul freedom and light shall inherit: Those who are guilty shall burn in fire and brimstone for ever. Occult actions revealing, each one shall publish his secrets; Secrets of every man's heart God shall reveal in the light. Then shall be weeping and wailing, yea, and gnashing of teeth; Eclipsed is the sun, and silenced the stars in their chorus. Over and gone is the splendor of moonlight, melted the heaven, Uplifted by Him are the valleys, and east down the mountains. Utterly gone among men are distinctions of lofty and lowly. Into the plains rush the hills, the skies and oceans are mingled. Oh, what an end of all things! earth broken in pieces shall perish; Swelling together at once shall the waters and flames flow in rivers. Sounding the archangel's trumpet shall peal down from heaven, Over the wicked who groan in their guilt and their manifold sorrows. Trembling, the earth shall be opened, revealing chaos and hell. Every king before God shall stand in that day to be judged. Rivers of fire and brimstone shall fall from the heavens. In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly given, although not in the exact order of the lines as connected with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter occurs, Latin words could not be found beginning with the corresponding letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if we note down together the initial letters of all the lines in our Latin translation except those three in which we retain the letter T in the proper place, they will express in five Greek words this meaning, Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the Son of God, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>. And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek words, ogr;, which mean, Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the Son of God, the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>, they will make the word, that is, fish, in which word <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters. But this sibyl, whether she is the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/384265PEry class=demonym long=26.4808 lat=38.3828>Erythraean</a>, or, as some rather believe, the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/408141PCum class=demonym long=14.058 lat=40.848>Cumaean</a>, in her whole poem, of which this is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate to the worship of the false or reigned gods, but rather speaks against them and their worshippers in such a way that we might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his work the prophecies about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> of a certain sibyl, he does not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many short quotations. She says; Afterward He shall come into the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give God buffets with profane hands, and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall for meat, and vinegar for His thirst: they will spread this table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast not understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him bitter gall. But the veil of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> shall be rent; and at midday it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall die the death, taking sleep for three days; and then returning from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning of the resurrection being shown to the recalled.

In order that we may be able to consider these times, let us go back a little to earlier times. At the beginning of the book of the prophet <a href=/people/2885 target=_blank>Hosea</a>, who is placed first of twelve, it is written, The word of the Lord which came to Hoses in the days of <a href=/people/3481 target=_blank>Uzziah</a>, Jothan, Ahaz, and <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a>, kings of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>. <a href=/people/2989 target=_blank>Amos</a> also writes that he prophesied in the days of <a href=/people/3481 target=_blank>Uzziah</a>, and adds the name of Jeroboam king of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, who lived at the same time. <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a> the son of <a href=/people/2989 target=_blank>Amos</a>-either the above-named prophet, or, as is rather affirmed, another who was not a prophet, but was called by the same name-also puts at the head of his book these four kings named by <a href=/people/2885 target=_blank>Hosea</a>, saying by way of preface that he prophesied in their days. <a href=/people/4609 target=_blank>Micah</a> also names the same times as those of his prophecy, after the days of <a href=/people/3481 target=_blank>Uzziah</a>; for he names the same three kings as <a href=/people/2885 target=_blank>Hosea</a> named,-<a href=/people/6572 target=_blank>Jotham</a>, Ahaz, and <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a>. We find from their own writings that these men prophesied contemporaneously. To these are added <a href=/people/3865 target=_blank>Jonah</a> in the reign of <a href=/people/3481 target=_blank>Uzziah</a>, and Joel in that of <a href=/people/6572 target=_blank>Jotham</a>, who succeeded <a href=/people/3481 target=_blank>Uzziah</a>. But we can find the date of these two prophets in the chronicles, Dot in their own writings, for they say nothing about it themselves. Now these days extend from <a href=/people/3674 target=_blank>Procas</a> king of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/417129RLat class=ethnic long=12.9 lat=41.7>Latins</a>. or his predecessor <a href=/people/2497 target=_blank>Aventinus</a>, down to <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a> king of the Romans, or even to the beginning of the reign of his successor <a href=/people/523 target=_blank>Numa</a> <a href=/people/1714 target=_blank>Pompilius</a>. <a href=/people/2413 target=_blank>Hezekiah</a> king of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> certainly reigned till then. So that thus these fountains of prophecy, as I may call them, burst forth at once during those times when the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kingdom failed and the Roman began; so that, just as in the first period of the <a href=/people/395 target=_blank>Assyrian</a> kingdom <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> arose, to whom the most distinct promises were made that all nations should be blessed in his seed, so at the beginning of the western <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, in the time of whose government <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> was to come in whom these promises were to be fulfilled, the oracles of the prophets were given not only in spoken but in written words, for a testimony that so great a thing should come to pass. For although the people of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> hardly ever lacked prophets from the time when they began to have kings, these were only for their own use, not for that of the nations. But when the more manifestly prophetic Scripture began to be formed, which was to benefit the nations too, it was fitting that it should begin when this city was founded which was to rule the nations. </p>                        </div>

The prophet <a href=/people/2885 target=_blank>Hosea</a> speaks so very profoundly that it is laborious work to penetrate his meaning. But, according to promise, we must insert something from his book. He says, And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be called the sons of the living God. Even the apostles understood this as a prophetic testimony of the calling of the nations who did not formerly belong to God; and because this same people of the Gentiles is itself spiritually among the children of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>, and for that reason is rightly called <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, therefore he goes on to say, And the children of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> and the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> shall be gathered together in one, and shall appoint themselves one headship, and shall ascend from the earth. We should but weaken the savor of this prophetic oracle if we set ourselves to expound it. Let the reader but call to mind that cornerstone and those two walls of partition, the one of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, the other of the Gentiles, and he will recognize them, the one under the term sons of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>, the other as sons of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, supporting themselves by one and the same headship, and ascending from the earth. But that those carnal <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a> who are <a href=/people/10951 target=_blank>sow</a> unwilling to believe in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> shall afterward believe, that is, their children shall (for they themselves, of course, shall go to their own place by dying), this same prophet testifies, saying, For the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> shall abide many days without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without an altar, without a priesthood, without manifestations. Who does not see that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> are now thus? But let us hear what he adds: And afterward shall the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> return, and seek the Lord their God, and <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> their king, and shall be amazed at the Lord and at His goodness in the latter days. Nothing is clearer than this prophecy, in which by <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>, as distinguished by the title of king, <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is to be understood, who is made, as the apostle says, of the seed of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> according to the flesh. This prophet has also foretold the resurrection of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> on the third day, as it behoved to be foretold, with prophetic loftiness, when he says, He will heal us after two days, and in the third day we shall rise again. In agreement with this the apostle says to us, If ye be risen with <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, seek those things which are above. <a href=/people/2989 target=_blank>Amos</a> also prophesies thus concerning such things: Prepare thee, that thou mayst invoke thy God, O <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>; for lo, I am binding the thunder, and creating the spirit, and announcing to men their <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. And in another place he says, In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> that is fallen, and build up the breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and will build them up again as in the days of old: that the residue of men may inquire for me, and all the nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord that doeth this. </p>                        </div>

The prophet <a href=/people/4609 target=_blank>Micah</a>, representing <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> under the figure of a great mountain, speaks thus: It shall come to pass in the last days, that the manifested mountain of the Lord shall be prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall hasten unto it. Many nations shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up into the mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>; and He will show us His way, and we will go in His paths: for out of <a href=/people/6056 target=_blank>Zion</a> shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off. This prophet predicts the very place in which <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> was born, saying, And thou, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/317352UBet class=place long=35.2021 lat=31.7122>Bethlehem</a>, of the house of Ephratah, art the least that can be reckoned among the thousands of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>; out of thee shall come forth unto me a leader, to be the prince in <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>; and His going forth is from the beginning, even from the days of eternity. Therefore will He give them [up] even until the time when she that travaileth shall bring forth; and the remnant of His brethren shall be converted to the sons of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>. And He shall stand, and see, and feed His flock in the strength of the Lord, and in the dignity of the name of the Lord His God: for now shall He be magnified even to the utmost of the earth. The prophet <a href=/people/3865 target=_blank>Jonah</a>, not so much by speech as by his own painful experience, prophesied <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>'s death and resurrection much more clearly than if he had proclaimed them with his voice. For why was he taken into the whale's belly and restored on the third day, but that he might be a sign that <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> should return from the depths of hell on the third day? I should be obliged to use many words in explaining all that Joel prophesies in order to make clear those that pertain to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and the Church. But there is one passage I must not pass by, which the apostles also quoted when the Holy Spirit came down from above on the assembled believers according to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>'s promise. He says, And it shall come to pass after these things, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream, and your young men shall see visions: and even on my servants and mine handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit. </p>                        </div>

The date of three of the minor prophets, <a href=/people/5836 target=_blank>Obadiah</a>, <a href=/people/8009 target=_blank>Nahum</a>, and Habakkuk, is neither mentioned by themselves nor given in the chronicles of <a href=/people/1157 target=_blank>Eusebius</a> and <a href=/people/5722 target=_blank>Jerome</a>. For although they put <a href=/people/5836 target=_blank>Obadiah</a> with <a href=/people/4609 target=_blank>Micah</a>, yet when <a href=/people/4609 target=_blank>Micah</a> prophesied does not appear from that part of their writings in which the dates are noted. And this, I think, has happened through their error in negligently copying the works of others. But we could not find the two others now mentioned in the copies of the chronicles which we have; yet because they are contained in the canon, we ought not to pass them by. <a href=/people/5836 target=_blank>Obadiah</a>, so far as his writings are concerned, the briefest of all the prophets, speaks against <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a>, that is, the nation of <a href=/people/4143 target=_blank>Esau</a> that reprobate eider of the twin sons of <a href=/people/1400 target=_blank>Isaac</a> and grandsons of <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a>. Now if, by that form of speech in which a part is put for the whole, we take <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a> as put for the nations, we may understand of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> what he says among other things, But upon Mount <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a> shall be safety, and there shall be a Holy One. And a little after, at the end of the same prophecy, he says, And those who are saved again shall come up out of Mount <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a>, that they may defend Mount <a href=/people/4143 target=_blank>Esau</a>, and it shall be a kingdom to the Lord. It is quite evident this was fulfilled when those saved again out of Mount <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a>-that is, the believers in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a>, of whom the apostles are chiefly to be acknowledged-went up to defend Mount <a href=/people/4143 target=_blank>Esau</a>. How could they defend it except by making safe, through the preaching of the gospel, those who believed that they might be delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God? This he expressed as an inference, adding, And it shall be to the Lord a kingdom. For Mount <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a> signifies Jades, where it is predicted there shall be safety, and a Holy One, that is, <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Jesus. But Mount <a href=/people/4143 target=_blank>Esau</a> is <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312347RIdu class=place long=34.75 lat=31.25>Idumea</a>, which signifies the Church of the Gentiles, which, as I have expounded, those saved again out of <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a> have defended that it should be a kingdom to the Lord. This was obscure before it took place; but what believer does not find it out now that it is done? As for the prophet <a href=/people/8009 target=_blank>Nahum</a>, through him God says, I will exterminate the graven and the molten things: I will make thy burial. For lo, the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings and announceth peace are swift upon the mountains! O <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>, celebrate thy festival days, and perform thy vows; for now they shall not go on any more so as to become antiquated. It is completed, it is consumed, it is taken away. He ascendeth who breathes in thy face, delivering thee out of tribulation. Let him that remembers the gospel call to mind who hath ascended from hell and breathed the Holy Spirit in the face of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>, that is, of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> disciples; for they belong to the New Testament, whose festival days are so spiritually renewed that they cannot become antiquated. Moreover, we already see the graven and molten things, that is, the idols of the false gods, exterminated through the gospel, and given up to oblivion as of the grave, and we know that this prophecy is fulfilled in this very thing. Of what else than the advent of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, who was to come, is Habakkuk understood to say, And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood, that he that readeth these things may understand. For the vision is yet for a time appointed, and it will arise in the end, and will not become void: if it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and will not be delayed? </p>                        </div>

In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> does he say, O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing, and was afraid: O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and was greatly afraid? What is this but the inexpressible admiration of the foreknown, new, and sudden salvation of men? In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be recognized. What is this but either between the two testaments, or between the two thieves, or between <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> and Elias talking with Him on the mount? While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt be recognized; at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown, does not even need exposition. While my soul shall be troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy. What is this but that He puts Himself for the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, of whose nation He was, who were troubled with great anger and crucified <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, when He, mindful of mercy, said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do? God shall come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/276382UTay class=place long=38.5302 lat=27.6502>Teman</a>, and the Holy One from the shady and close mountain. What is said here, He shall come from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/276382UTay class=place long=38.5302 lat=27.6502>Teman</a>, some interpret from the south, or from the southwest, by which is signified the noonday, that is, the fervor of charity and the splendor of truth. The shady and close mountain might be understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning the depth of the divine Scriptures, in which <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is prophesied: for in the Scriptures there are many things shady and close which exercise the mind of the reader; and <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> comes thence when he who has understanding finds Him there. His power covereth up the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise. What is this but what is also said in the psalm, Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory above all the earth? His splendor shall be as the light. What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers? Horns are in His hands. What is this but the trophy of the cross? And He hath placed the firm charity of His strength needs no exposition. Before His face shall go the word, and it shall go forth into the field after His feet. What is this but that He should both be announced before His coming hither and after His return hence? He stood, and the earth was moved. What is this but that He stood for succor, and the earth was moved to believe? He regarded, and the nations melted; that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent. The mountains are broken with violence; that is, through the power of those who work miracles the pride of the haughty is broken The everlasting hills flowed down; that is, they are humbled in time that they may be lifted up for eternity. I saw His goings [made] eternal for his labors; that is, I beheld His labor of love not left without the reward of eternity. The tents of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a> shall be greatly afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian that is, even those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being suddenly terrified by the news of Thy wonderful works, shall become a <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> people. Wert Thou angry at the rivers, O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage against the sea? This is said because He does not now come to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. For Thou shall mount upon Thy <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, and Thy riding shall be salvation; that is, Thine evangelists shall carry Thee, for they are guided by Thee, and Thy gospel is salvation to them that believe in Thee. Bending, Thou wilt bend Thy bow against the sceptres, saith the Lord; that is, Thou wilt threaten even the kings of the earth with Thy judgment. The earth shall be cleft with rivers; that is, by the sermons of those who preach Thee flowing in upon them, men's hearts shall be opened to make confession, to whom it is said, Rend your hearts and not your garments. What does The people shall see Thee and grieve mean, but that in mourning they shall be blessed? What is Scattering the waters in marching, but that by walking in those who everywhere proclaim Thee, Thou wilt scatter hither and thither the streams of Thy doctrine? What is The abyss uttered its voice? Is it not that the depth of the human heart expressed what it perceived? The words, The depth of its phantasy, are an explanation of the previous verse, for the depth is the abyss; and Uttered its voice is to be understood before them, that is, as we have said, it expressed what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. The sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course; that is, <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> ascended into heaven, and the Church was established under her King. Thy darts shall go in the light; that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but openly. For He had said to His own disciples, What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in the light. By threatening thou shall diminish the earth; that is, by that threatening Thou shall humble men. And in fury Thou shall cast down the nations; for in punishing those who exalt themselves Thou dashest them one against another. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>; Thou hast sent death on the heads of the wicked. None of these words require exposition. Thou hast lifted up the bonds, even to the neck. This may be understood even of the good bonds of wisdom, that the feet may be put into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. Thou hast struck off in amazement of mind the bonds must be understood for, He lifts up the good and strikes off the bad, about. which it is said to Him, Thou hast broken asunder my bonds, and that in amazement of mind, that is, wonderfully. The heads of the mighty shall be moved in it; to wit, in that wonder. They shall open their teeth like a poor man eating secretly. For some of the mighty among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and words, and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for fear of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, just as the Gospel has shown they did. And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy <a href=/people/10959 target=_blank>horses</a>, troubling many waters, which are nothing else than many people; for unless all were troubled, some would not be converted with fear, others pursued with fury. I gave heed, and my belly trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling entered into my bones, and my habit of body was troubled under me. He gave heed to those things which he said, and was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he had poured forth prophetically, and in which he discerned things to come. For when many people are troubled, he saw the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged himself a member of it, and said, I shall rest in the day of tribulation, as being one of those Who are rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation. That I may ascend, he says, among the people of my pilgrimage, departing quite from the wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in this earth, and do not seek the country above. Although the fig-tree, he says, shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall lie, and the fields shall yield no meat; the <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> shall be cut off from the meat, and there shall be no <a href=/people/10961 target=_blank>oxen</a> in the stalls. He sees that nation which was to slay <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> about to lose the abundance of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set forth by the figure of earthly plenty. And because that nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its own, he immediately says, Yet will I rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and He will set my feet in completion; He will place me above the heights, that I may conquer in His song, to wit, in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm, He set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God. He therefore conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in His praise, not in his own; that He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. But some copies have, I will joy in God my Jesus, which seems to me better than the version of those who, wishing to put it in Latin, have not set down that very name which for us it is dearer and sweeter to name. </p>                        </div>

He prophesied when <a href=/people/4173 target=_blank>Josiah</a> reigned in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, and <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus Martius</a> at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a>, when the captivity of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> was already at hand; and he continued to prophesy down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his writings. Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along with him, because he himself says that he prophesied in the days of <a href=/people/4173 target=_blank>Josiah</a>; but he does not say till when. <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a> thus prophesied not only in the times of <a href=/people/12006 target=_blank>Ancus Martius</a>, but also in those of <a href=/people/6002 target=_blank>Tarquinius</a> <a href=/people/1008 target=_blank>Priscus</a>, whom the Romans had for their fifth king. For he had already begun to reign when that captivity took place. <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>, in prophesying of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, says, The breath of our mouth, the Lord <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, was taken in our sins, thus briefly showing both that <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is our Lord and that He suffered for us. Also in another place he says, This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of prudence, and hath given it to <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> His servant, and to <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> His beloved: afterwards He was seen on the earth, and conversed with men. Some attribute this testimony not to <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>, but to his secretary, who was called <a href=/people/6287 target=_blank>Baruch</a>; but it is more commonly ascribed to <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>. Again the same prophet says concerning Him, Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> a righteous shoot, and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth. In those days <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> shall be saved, and <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> shall dwell confidently: and this is the name which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord. And of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and which we now see fulfilled, he thus spoke: O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of evils. to Thee shall the nations come from the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no profit. But that the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, by whom He behoved even to be slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus intimates: Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man, and who shall know Him? That passage also is his which I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new testament, of which <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is the Mediator. For <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a> himself says, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will complete over the house of <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a> a new testament, and the rest, which may be read there. For the present I shall put down those predictions about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> by the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied with <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>. Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection, in the future; because it is my determination to assemble the nations, and gather together the kingdoms. And again he says, The Lord will be terrible upon them, and will exterminate all the gods of the earth; and they shall worship Him every man from his place, even all the isles of the nations. And a little after he says, Then will I turn to the people a tongue, and to His offspring, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and serve Him under one yoke. From the borders of the rivers of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/130350REth class=place long=35.01 lat=13.01>Ethiopia</a>: shall they bring sacrifices unto me. In that day thou shall not be confounded for all thy curious inventions, which thou hast done impiously against me: for then I will take away from thee the Haughtiness of thy trespass; and thou shalt no more magnify thyself above thy holy mountain. And I will leave in thee a meek and humble people, and they who shall be left of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> shall fear the name of the Lord. These are the remnant of whom the apostle quotes that which is elsewhere prophesied: Though the number of the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved. These are the remnant of that nation who have believed in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. </p>                        </div>

He says, And I will set up over my <a href=/people/10954 target=_blank>sheep</a> one Shepherd, who will feed them, even my servant <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a>; and He shall feed them, and He shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> a prince in the midst of them. I the Lord have spoken. And in another place he says, And one King shall be over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms: neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, and their abominations, and all their iniquities. And I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant <a href=/people/546 target=_blank>David</a> shall be king over them, and there shall be one Shepherd for them all. </p>                        </div>

There remain three minor prophets, <a href=/people/2519 target=_blank>Haggai</a>, Zechariah, and <a href=/people/3626 target=_blank>Malachi</a>, who prophesied at the close of the captivity. Of these <a href=/people/2519 target=_blank>Haggai</a> more openly prophesies of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and the Church thus briefly: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet one little while, and I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will move all nations, and the desired of all nations shall come. The fulfillment of this prophecy is in part already seen, and in part hoped for in the end. For He moved the heaven by the testimony of the angels and the stars, when <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> became incarnate. He moved the earth by the great miracle of His birth of the virgin. He moved the sea and the dry land, when <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> was proclaimed both in the isles and in the whole world. So we see all nations moved to the faith; and the fulfillment of what follows, And the desired of all nations shall come, is looked for at His last coming. For ere men can desire and and wait for Him, they must believe and love Him. Zechariah says of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and the Church, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a>; shout joyfully, O daughter of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; behold, thy King shall come unto thee, just and the <a href=/people/295 target=_blank>Saviour</a>; Himself poor, and mounting an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>, and a colt the foal of an <a href=/people/10962 target=_blank>ass</a>: and His dominion shall be from Sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. How this was done, when the Lord <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> on His journey used a beast of burden of this kind, we read in the Gospel, where, also, as much of this prophecy is quoted as appears sufficient for the context. In another place, speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Himself of the remission of sins through His blood, he says, Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament, hast sent forth Thy prisoners from the lake wherein is no water. Different opinions may be held, consistently with right belief, as to what he meant by this lake. Yet it seems to me that no meaning suits better than that of the depth of human misery, which is, as it were, dry and barren, where there are no streams of righteousness, but only the mire of iniquity. For it is said of it in the Psalms, And He led me forth out of the lake of misery, and from the miry clay. <a href=/people/3626 target=_blank>Malachi</a>, foretelling the Church which we now behold propagated through <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, says most openly to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, in the person of God, I have no pleasure in you, and I will not accept a gift at your hand. For from the rising even to the going down of the sun, my name is great among the nations; and in every place sacrifice shall be made, and a pure oblation shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith the Lord. Since we can already see this sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the rising of the sun to his going down, through <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>'s priesthood after the order of Melchisedec, while the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, to whom it was said, I have no pleasure in you, neither will I accept a gift at your hand, cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased, why do they still look for another <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, when they read this in the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not be fulfilled except through Him? And a little after he says of Him, in the person of God, My covenant was with Him of life and peace: and I gave to Him that He might fear me with fear, and be afraid before my name. The law of truth was in His mouth: directing in peace He hath walked with me, and hath turned many away from iniquity. For the Priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth: for He is the Angel of the Lord Almighty. Nor is it to be wondered at that <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Jesus is called the Angel of the Almighty God. For just as He is called a servant on account of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is called an angel on account of the evangel which He proclaimed to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, evangel is good news, and angel is messenger. Again he says of Him, Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, even the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing? In this place he has foretold both the first and second advent of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>: the first, to wit, of which he says, And He shall come suddenly into His <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>; that is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, Destroy this <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, and in three days I will raise it up again. And of the second advent he says, Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing? But what he says, The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire, just means that even the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, according to the Scriptures which they read, shall seek and desire <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. But many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, My testament had been with Him, or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to take to be the new testament, in which the things promised are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal. Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness of the new testament, which shall be given only to the good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says, Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said, Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches every one to his neighbor: and the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name. By that book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what follows: And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust, and between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds. And ye shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do [this], saith the Lord Almighty. This day is the day of judgment, of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its own place. </p>                        </div>

In the time of our prophets, then, whose writings had already come to the knowledge of almost all nations. the philosophers of the nations had not yet arisen,-at least, not those who were called by that name, which originated with <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/377269PSam class=person long=26.935 lat=37.695>Samian</a>, who was becoming famous at the time when the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> captivity ended. Much more, then, are the other philosophers found to be later than the prophets. For even <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a> the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=person long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenian</a>, the master of all who were then most famous, holding the pre-eminence in that department that is called the moral or active, is found after <a href=/people/1940 target=_blank>Esdras</a> in the chronicles. <a href=/people/12 target=_blank>Plato</a> also was born not much later, who far out went the other disciples of <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socrates</a>. If, besides these, we take their predecessors, who had not yet been styled philosophers, to wit, the seven sages, and then the physicists, who succeeded <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a>, and imitated his studious search into the nature of things, namely, <a href=/people/1151 target=_blank>Anaximander</a>, <a href=/people/666 target=_blank>Anaximenes</a>, and <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a>, and some others, before <a href=/people/58 target=_blank>Pythagoras</a> first professed himself a philosopher, even these did not precede the whole of our prophets in antiquity of time, since <a href=/people/263 target=_blank>Thales</a>, whom the others succeeded, is said to have flourished in the reign of <a href=/people/167 target=_blank>Romulus</a>, when the stream of prophecy burst forth from the fountains of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> in those writings which spread over the whole world. So that only those theological poets, <a href=/people/143 target=_blank>Orpheus</a>, <a href=/people/696 target=_blank>Linus</a>, and <a href=/people/905 target=_blank>Musaeus</a>, and, it may be, some others among the Greeks, are found earlier in date than the Hebrew prophets whose writings we hold as authoritative. But not even these preceded in time our true divine, <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>, who authentically preached the one true God, and whose writings are first in the authoritative canon; and therefore the Greeks, in whose tongue the literature of this age chiefly appears, have no ground for boasting of their wisdom, in which our religion, wherein is true wisdom, is not evidently more ancient at least, if not superior. Yet it must be confessed that before <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> there had already been, not indeed among the Greeks, but among barbarous nations, as in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, some doctrine which might be called their wisdom, else it would not have been written in the holy books that <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a> was learned in all the wisdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, as he was, when, being born there, and adopted and nursed by Pharaoh's daughter, he was also liberally educated. Yet not even the wisdom of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a> could be antecedent in time to the wisdom of our prophets, because even <a href=/people/469 target=_blank>Abraham</a> was a prophet.

If I may recall far more ancient times, our patriarch <a href=/people/823 target=_blank>Noah</a> was certainly even before that great deluge, and I might not undeservedly call him a prophet, forasmuch as the ark he made, in which he escaped with his family, was itself a prophecy of our times. What of <a href=/people/3590 target=_blank>Enoch</a>, the seventh from <a href=/people/883 target=_blank>Adam</a>? Does not the canonical epistle of the Apostle Jude declare that he prophesied? But the writings of these men could not be held as authoritative either among the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> or us, on account of their too great antiquity, which made it seem needful to regard them with suspicion, lest false things should be set forth instead roof true. For some writings which are said be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own humor, loosely believe what they please. But the purity of the canon has not admitted these writings, not because the authority of these men who pleased God is rejected, but because they are not believed to be theirs. Nor ought it to appear strange if writings for which so great antiquity is claimed are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history of the kings of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a> and <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> containing their acts, which we believe to belong to the canonical Scripture, very many things are mentioned which are not explained there, but are said to be found in other books which the prophets wrote, the very names of these prophets being sometimes given, and yet they are not found in the canon which the people of God received. Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me; only I think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious authority, might write some things as men by historical diligence, and others as prophets by divine inspiration; and these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to God speaking through them: and so the one pertained to the abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion. In that authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings outside of it are now brought forward under the name of the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they are genuine; and on this account they are not trusted, especially those of them in which some things are found that are even contrary to the truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent they do not belong to them. </p>                        </div>

The Scripture calls these men γραμματεισαγωγείς, who may be called in Latin inductores or introductores of letters, because they, as it were, introduce them into the hearts of the learners, or rather lead those whom they teach into them.

But, on the other hand, the citizens of the impious city, scattered everywhere through the earth, when they read the most learned writers, none of whom seems to be of contemptible authority, and find them disagreeing among themselves about affairs most remote from the memory of our age, cannot find out whom they ought to trust. But we, being sustained by divine authority in the history of our religion, have no doubt that whatever is opposed to it is most false, whatever may. be the case regarding other things in secular books, which, whether true or false, yield nothing of moment to our living rightly and happily. </p>                        </div>

But let us omit further examination of history, and return to the philosophers from whom we digressed to these things. They seem to have labored in their studies for no other end than to find out how to live in a way proper for laying hold of blessedness. Why, then, have the disciples dissented from their masters, and the fellow-disciples from one another, except because as men they have sought after these things by human sense and human reasonings? Now, although there might be among them a desire of glory, so that each wished to be thought wiser and more acute than another, and in no way addicted to the judgment of others, but the inventor of his own dogma and opinion, yet I may grant that there were some, or even very many of them, whose love of truth severed them from their teachers or fellow-disciples, that they might strive for what they thought was the truth, whether it was so or not. But what can human misery do, or how or where can it reach forth, so as to attain blessedness, if divine authority does not lead it? Finally, let our authors, among whom the canon of the sacred books is fixed and bounded, be far from disagreeing in any respect. It is not without good reason, then, that not merely a few people prating in the schools and gymnasia in captious disputations, but so many and great people, both learned and unlearned, in countries and cities, have believed that God spoke to them or by them, i.e. the canonical writers, when they wrote these books. There ought, indeed, to be but few of them, lest on account of their multitude what ought to be religiously esteemed should grow cheap; and yet not so few that their agreement should not be wonderful. For among the multitude of philosophers, who in their works have left behind them the monuments of their dogmas, no one will easily find any who agree in all their opinions. But to show this is too long a task for this work. But what author of any sect is so approved in this demon-worshipping city, that the rest who have differed from or opposed him in opinion have been disapproved? The <a href=/people/10981 target=_blank>Epicureans</a> asserted that human affairs were not under the providence of the gods; and the <a href=/people/11086 target=_blank>Stoics</a>, holding the opposite opinion, agreed that they were ruled and defended by favorable and tutelary gods. Yet were not both sects famous among the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>? I wonder, then, why <a href=/people/269 target=_blank>Anaxagoras</a> was accused of a crime for saying that the sun was a burning stone, and denying that it was a god at all; while in the same city <a href=/people/106 target=_blank>Epicurus</a> flourished gloriously and lived securely, although he not only did not believe that the sun or any star was a god, but contended that neither <a href=/people/1 target=_blank>Jupiter</a> nor any of the gods dwelt in the world at all, so that the prayers and supplications of men might reach them! Were not both <a href=/people/345 target=_blank>Aristippus</a> and <a href=/people/436 target=_blank>Antisthenes</a> there, two noble philosophers and both <a href=/people/16 target=_blank>Socratic</a>? yet they placed the chief end of life within bounds so diverse and contradictory, that the first made the delight of the body the chief good, while the other asserted that man was made happy mainly by the virtue of the mind. The one also said that the wise man should flee from the republic; the other, that he should administer its affairs. Yet did not each gather disciples to follow his own sect? Indeed, in the conspicuous and well-known porch, in gymnasia, in gardens, in places public and private, they openly strove in bands each for his own opinion, some asserting there was one world, others innumerable worlds; some that this world had a beginning, others that it had not; some that it would perish, others that it would exist always; some that it was governed by the divine mind, others by chance and accident; some that souls are immortal, others that they are mortal,-and of those who asserted their immortality, some said they transmigrated through beasts, others that it was by no means so; while of those who asserted their mortality, some said they perished immediately after the body, others that they survived either a little while or a longer time, but not always; some fixing supreme good in the body, some in the mind, some in both; others adding to the mind and body external good things; some thinking that the bodily senses ought to be trusted always, some not always, others never. Now what people, senate, power, or public dignity of the impious city has ever taken care to judge between all these and oilier well-nigh innumerable dissensions of the philosophers, approving and accepting some, and disapproving and rejecting others? Has it not held in its bosom at random, without any judgment, and confusedly, so many controversies of men at variance, not about fields, houses, or anything of a pecuniary nature, but about those things which make life either miserable or happy? Even if some true things were said in it, yet falsehoods were uttered with the same licence; so that such a city has not amiss received the title of the mystic <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>. For <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a> means confusion, as we remember we have already explained. Nor does it matter to the devil, its king, how they wrangle among themselves in contradictory errors, since all alike deservedly belong to him on account of their great and varied impiety. But that nation, that people, that city, that republic, these <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a>, to whom the oracles of God were entrusted, by no means confounded with similar licence false prophets with the true prophets; but, agreeing together, and differing in nothing, acknowledged and upheld the authentic authors of their sacred books. These were their philosophers, these were their sages, divines, prophets, and teachers of probity and piety. Whoever was wise and lived according to them was wise and lived not according to men, but according to God who hath spoken by them. If sacrilege is forbidden there, God hath forbidden it. If it is said, Honor thy father and thy mother, God hath commanded it. If it is said, Thou shall not commit adultery, Thou shall not kill, Thou shall not steal, and other similar commandments, not human lips but the divine oracles have enounced them. Whatever truth certain philosophers, amid their false opinions, were able to see, and strove by laborious discussions to persuade men of,-such as that God had made this world, and Himself most providently governs it, or of the nobility of the virtues, of the love of country, of fidelity in friendship, of good works and everything pertaining to virtuous manners, although they knew not to what end and what rule all these things were to be referred,-all these, by words prophetic, that is, divine, although spoken by men, were commended to the people in that city, and not inculcated by contention in arguments, so that he who should know them might be afraid of contemning, not the wit of men, but the oracle of God. </p>                        </div>

It is reported, indeed, that there was an agreement in their words so wonderful, stupendous, and plainly divine, that when they had sat at this work, each one apart (for so it pleased <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> to test their fidelity), they differed from each other in no word which had the same meaning and force, or, in the order of the words; but, as if the translators had been one, so what all had translated was one, because in very deed the one Spirit had been in them all.

For while there were other interpreters who translated these sacred oracles out of the Hebrew tongue into Greek, as <a href=/people/2035 target=_blank>Aquila</a>, Symmathus, and <a href=/people/6988 target=_blank>Theodotion</a>, and also that translation which, as the name of the author is unknown, is quoted as the fifth edition, yet the Church has received this Septuagint translation just as if it were the only one; and it has been used by the Greek <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> people, most of whom are not aware that there is any other. From this translation there has also been made a translation in the Latin tongue, which the Latin churches use. Our times, however, have enjoyed the advantage of the presbyter <a href=/people/5722 target=_blank>Jerome</a>, a man most learned, and skilled in all three languages, who translated these same Scriptures into the Latin speech, not from the Greek, but from the Hebrew. But although the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> acknowledge this very learned labor of his to be faithful, while they contend that the Septuagint translators have erred in many places, still the churches of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> judge that no one should be preferred to the authority of so many men, chosen for this very great work by <a href=/people/1398 target=_blank>Eleazar</a>, who was then high priest; for even if there had not appeared in them one spirit, without doubt divine, and the seventy learned men had, after the manner of men, compared together the words of their translation, that what pleased them all might stand, no single translator ought to be preferred to them; but since so great a sign of divinity has appeared in them, certainly, if any other translator, of their Scriptures from the Hebrew into any other tongue is faithful, in that case he agrees with these seventy translators, and if he is not found to agree with them, then we ought to believe that the prophetic gift is with them. For the same Spirit who was in the prophets when they spoke these things was also in the seventy men when they translated them, so that assuredly they could also say something else, just as if the prophet himself had said both, because it would be the same Spirit who said both; and could say the same thing differently, so that, although the words were not the same, yet the same meaning should shine forth to those of good understanding; and could omit or add something, so that even by this it might be shown that there was in that work not human bondage, which the translator owed to the words, but rather divine power, which filled and ruled the mind of the translator. Some, however, have thought that the Greek copies of the Septuagint version should be emended from the Hebrew copies; yet they did not dare to take away what the Hebrew lacked and the Septuagint had, but only added what was found in the Hebrew copies and was lacking in the Septuagint, and noted them by placing at the beginning of the verses certain marks in the form of stars which they call asterisks. And those things which the Hebrew copies have not, but the Septuagint have, they have in like manner marked at the beginning of the verses by horizontal spit-shaped marks like those by which we denote ounces; and many copies having these marks are circulated even in Latin. But we cannot, without inspecting both kinds of copies, find out those things which are neither omitted nor added, but expressed differently, whether they yield another meaning not in itself unsuitable, or can be shown to explain the same meaning in another way. If, then, as it behoves us, we behold nothing else in these Scriptures than what the Spirit of God has spoken through men, if anything is in the Hebrew copies and is not in the version of the Seventy, the Spirit of God did not choose to say it through them, but only through the prophets. But whatever is in the Septuagint and not in the Hebrew copies, the same Spirit chose rather to say through the latter, thus showing that both were prophets. For in that manner He spoke as He chose, some things through <a href=/people/1048 target=_blank>Isaiah</a>, some through <a href=/people/1314 target=_blank>Jeremiah</a>, some through several prophets, or else the same thing through this prophet and through that. Further, whatever is found in both editions, that one and the same Spirit willed to say through both, but so as that the former preceded in prophesying, and the latter followed: in prophetically interpreting them; because, as the one Spirit of peace was in the former when they spoke true and concordant words, so the selfsame one Spirit hath appeared in the latter, when, without mutual conference they yet interpreted all things as if with one mouth. </p>                        </div>

But some one may say, How shall I know whether the prophet <a href=/people/3865 target=_blank>Jonah</a> said to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=ethnic long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Ninevites</a>, 'Yet three days and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a> shall be overthrown,' or forty days? For who does not see that the prophet could not say both, when he was sent to terrify the city by the threat of imminent ruin? For if its destruction was to take place on the third day, it certainly could not be on the fortieth; but if on the fortieth, then certainly not on the third. If, then, I am asked which of these <a href=/people/3865 target=_blank>Jonah</a> may have said, I rather think what is read in the Hebrew, Yet forty days and <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a> shall be overthrown. Yet the Seventy, interpreting long afterward, could say what was different and yet pertinent to the matter, and agree in the self-same meaning, although under a different signification. And this may admonish the reader not to despise the authority of either, but to raise himself above the history, and search for those things which the history itself was written to set forth. These things, indeed, took place in the city of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a>, but they also signified something else too great to apply to that city; just as, when it happened that the prophet himself was three days in the whale's belly, it signified besides, that He who is Lord of all the prophets should be three days in the depths of hell. Wherefore, if that city is rightly held as prophetically representing the Church of the Gentiles, to wit, as brought down by penitence, so as no longer to be what it had been, since this was done by <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> in the Church of the Gentiles, which <a about=https://topostext.org/place/363432UNin class=place long=43.1523 lat=36.3578>Nineveh</a> represented, <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Himself was signified both by the forty and by the three days: by the forty, because He spent that number of days with His disciples after the resurrection, and then ascended into heaven, but by the three days, because He rose on the third day. So that, if the reader desires nothing else than to adhere to the history of events, he may be aroused from his sleep by the Septuagint interpreters, as well as the prophets, to search into the depth of the prophecy, as if they had said, In the forty days seek Him in whom thou mayest also find the three days,-the one thou wilt find in His ascension, the other in His resurrection. Because that which could be most suitably signified by both numbers, of which one is used by <a href=/people/3865 target=_blank>Jonah</a> the prophet, the other by the prophecy of the Septuagint version, the one and self-same Spirit hath spoken. I dread prolixity, so that I must not demonstrate this by many instances in which the seventy interpreters may be thought to differ from the Hebrew, and yet, when well understood, are found to agree. For which reason I also, according to my capacity, following the footsteps of the apostles, who themselves have quoted prophetic testimonies from both, that is, from the Hebrew and the Septuagint, have thought that both should be used as authoritative, since both are one, and divine. But let us now follow out as we can what remains. </p>                        </div>

The <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> nation no doubt became worse after it ceased to have prophets, just at the very time when, on the rebuilding of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> after the captivity in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab class=place long=44.421 lat=32.542>Babylon</a>, it hoped to become better. For so, indeed, did that carnal people understand what was foretold by <a href=/people/2519 target=_blank>Haggai</a> the prophet, saying, The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former. Now, that this is said of the new testament, he showed a little above, where he says, evidently promising <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, And I will move all nations, and the desired One shall come to all nations. In this passage the Septuagint translators giving another sense more suitable to the body than the Head, that is, to the Church than to <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, have said by prophetic authority, The things shall come that are chosen of the Lord from all nations, that is, men, of whom Jesus saith in the Gospel, Many are called, but few are chosen. For by such chosen ones of the nations there is built, through the new testament, with living stones, a house of God far more glorious than that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> was which was constructed by king <a href=/people/574 target=_blank>Solomon</a>, and rebuilt after the captivity. For this reason, then, that nation had no prophets from that time, but was afflicted with many plagues by kings of alien race, and by the Romans themselves, lest they should fancy that this prophecy of <a href=/people/2519 target=_blank>Haggai</a> was fulfilled by that rebuilding of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. For not long after, on the arrival of <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, it was subdued, when, although there was no pillaging, because they dared not resist him, and thus, being very easily subdued, received him peaceably, yet the glory of that house was not so great as it was when under the free power of their own kings. <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, indeed, offered up sacrifices in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of God, not as a convert to His worship in true piety, but thinking, with impious folly, that He was to be worshipped along with false gods. Then <a href=/people/8223 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> son of <a href=/people/742 target=_blank>Lagus</a>, whom I have already mentioned, after <a href=/people/6 target=_blank>Alexander</a>'s death carried them captive into <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>. His successor, <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> <a href=/people/814 target=_blank>Philadelphus</a>, most benevolently dismissed them; and by him it was brought about, as I have narrated a little before, that we should have the Septuagint version of the Scriptures. Then they were crushed by the wars which are explained in the books of the <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabees</a>. Afterward they were taken captive by <a href=/people/21 target=_blank>Ptolemy</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle class=place long=29.897 lat=31.182>Alexandria</a>, who was called <a href=/people/1219 target=_blank>Epiphanes</a>. Then <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a> king of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr class=place long=39 lat=35.5>Syria</a> compelled them by many and most grievous evils to worship idols, and filled the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> itself with the sacrilegious superstitions of the Gentiles. Yet their most vigorous leader <a href=/people/11036 target=_blank>Judas</a>, who is also called <a href=/people/5098 target=_blank>Maccabaeus</a>, after beating the generals of <a href=/people/42 target=_blank>Antiochus</a>, cleansed it from all that defilement of idolatry. But not long after, one <a href=/people/1438 target=_blank>Alcimus</a>, although an alien from the sacerdotal tribe, was, through ambition, made pontiff, which was an impious thing. After almost fifty years, during which they never had peace, although they prospered in some affairs, <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> first assumed the diadem among them, and was made both king and pontiff. Before that, indeed, from the time of their return from the <a href=/people/8947 target=_blank>Babylonish</a> captivity and the rebuilding of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, they had not kings, but generals or principes. Although a king himself may be called a prince, from his principality in governing, and a leader, because he leads the army, but it does not follow that all who are princes and leaders may also be called kings, as that <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> was. He was succeeded by <a href=/people/13 target=_blank>Alexander</a>, also both king and pontiff, who is reported to have reigned over them cruelly. After him his wife <a href=/people/1106 target=_blank>Alexandra</a> was queen of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a>, and from her time downwards more grievous evils pursued them; for this <a href=/people/1106 target=_blank>Alexandra</a>'s sons, <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> and <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a>, when contending with each other for the kingdom, called in the Roman forces against the nation of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>. For <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> asked assistance from them against his brother. At that time <a about=https://topostext.org/place/419125PRom class=place long=12.486 lat=41.891>Rome</a> had already subdued Africa and Greece, and ruled extensively in other parts of the world also, and yet, as if unable to bear her own weight, had, in a manner, broken herself by her own size. For indeed she had come to grave domestic seditions, and from that to social wars, and by and by to civil wars, and had enfeebled and worn herself out so much, that the changed state of the republic, in which she should be governed by kings, was now imminent. <a href=/people/7 target=_blank>Pompey</a> then, a most illustrious prince of the Roman people, having entered <a about=https://topostext.org/place/316353UIud class=place long=35.3063 lat=31.6988>Judea</a> with an army, took the city, threw open the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, not with the devotion of a suppliant, but with the authority of a conqueror, and went, not reverently, but profanely, into the holy of holies, where it was lawful for none but the pontiff to enter. Having established <a href=/people/203 target=_blank>Hyrcanus</a> in the pontificate, and set <a href=/people/74 target=_blank>Antipater</a> over the subjugated nation as guardian or procurator, as they were then called, he led <a href=/people/181 target=_blank>Aristobulus</a> with him bound. From that time the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> also began to be Roman tributaries. Afterward <a href=/people/61 target=_blank>Cassius</a> plundered the very <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>. Then after a few years it was their desert to have <a href=/people/1562 target=_blank>Herod</a>, a king of foreign birth, in whose reign <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> was born. For the time had now come signified by the prophetic Spirit through the mouth of the patriarch <a href=/people/947 target=_blank>Jacob</a>, when he says, There shall not be lacking a prince out of <a href=/people/1022 target=_blank>Judah</a>, nor a teacher from his loins, until He shall come for whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation of the nations. There lacked not therefore a <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> prince of the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> until that <a href=/people/1562 target=_blank>Herod</a>, who was the first king of a foreign race received by them. Therefore it was now the time when He should come for whom that was reserved which is promised in the New Testament, that He should be the expectation of the nations. But it was not possible that the nations should expect He would come, as we see they did, to do judgment in the splendor of power, unless they should first believe in Him when He came to suffer judgment in the humility of patience. </p>                        </div>

For so had the prophet foretold: Behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us. He did many miracles that He might commend God in Himself, some of which, even as many as seemed sufficient to proclaim Him, are contained in the evangelic Scripture. The first of these is, that He was so wonderfully born, and the last, that with His body raised up again from the dead He ascended into heaven. But the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who slew Him, and would not believe in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise again, were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly rooted out from their kingdom, where aliens had already ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands (so that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have not forged the prophecies about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. And very many of them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly after His resurrection, believed on Him, of whom it was predicted, Though the number of the children of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved. But the rest are blinded, of whom it was predicted, Let their table be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block. Let their eyes be darkened lest they see, and bow down their back alway. Therefore, when they do not believe our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> have forged these prophecies about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> which are quoted under the name of the sibyl, or of others, if such there be, who do not belong to the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jewish</a> people. For us, indeed, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute by their possession of these books, while they themselves are dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent before in the Psalms, which they also read, where it is written, My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them, lest they should at last forget Thy law: disperse them in Thy might. Therefore God has shown the Church in her enemies the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the apostle, their offence is the salvation of the Gentiles. And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not let the knowledge that they are <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> be lost in them, although they have been conquered by the Romans, lest they should forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not enough that he should say, Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law, unless he had also added, Disperse them; because if they had only been in their own land with that testimony of the Scriptures, and not every where, certainly the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were sent before concerning <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. </p>                        </div>

Wherefore if we read of any foreigner-that is, one neither born of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> nor received by that people into the canon of the sacred books-having prophesied something about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, if it has come or shall come to our knowledge, we can refer to it over and above; not that this is necessary, even if wanting, but because it is not incongruous to believe that even in other nations there may have been men to whom this mystery was revealed, and who were also impelled to proclaim it, whether they were partakers of the same grace or had no experience of it, but were taught by bad angels, who, as we know, even confessed the present <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, whom the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> did not acknowledge. Nor do I think the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> themselves dare contend that no one has belonged to God except the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a>, since the increase of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a> began on the rejection of his elder brother. For in very deed there was no other people who were specially called the people of God; but they cannot deny that there have been certain men even of other nations who belonged, not by earthly but heavenly fellowship, to the true <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a>, the citizens of the country that is above. Because, if they deny this, they can be most easily confuted by the case of the holy and wonderful man Job, who was neither a native nor a proselyte, that is, a stranger joining the people of <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, but, being bred of the <a href=/people/5714 target=_blank>Idumean</a> race, arose there and died there too, and who is so praised by the divine oracle, that no man of his times is put on a level with him as regards justice and piety. And although we do not find his date in the chronicles, yet from his book, which for its merit the <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israelites</a> have received as of canonical authority, we gather that he was in the third generation after <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>. And I doubt not it was divinely provided, that from this one case we might know that among other nations also there might be men pertaining to the spiritual <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> who have lived according to God and have pleased Him. And it is not to be supposed that this was granted to any one, unless the one Mediator between God and men, the Man <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Jesus, was divinely revealed to him; who was pre-announced to the saints of old as yet to come in the flesh, even as He is announced to us as having come, that the self-same faith through Him may lead all to God who are predestinated to be the city of God, the house of God, and the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> of God. But whatever prophecies concerning the grace of God through <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Jesus are quoted, they may be thought to have been forged by the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>.

But this house which pertains to the new testament is just as much more glorious as the living stones, even believing, renewed men, of which it is constructed are better. But it was typified by the rebuilding of that <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a> for this reason, because the very renovation of that edifice typifies in the prophetic oracle another testament which is called the new. When, therefore, God said by the prophet just named, And I will give peace in this place, He is to be understood who is typified by that typical place; for since by that rebuilt place is typified the Church which was to be built by <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, nothing else can be accepted as the meaning of the saying, I will give peace in this place, except I will give peace in the place which that place signifies. For all typical things seem in some way to personate those whom they typify, as it is said by the apostle, That Rock was <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. Therefore the glory of this new testament house is greater than the glory of the old testament house; and it will show itself as greater when it shall be dedicated. For then shall come the desired of all nations, as we read in the Hebrew. For before His advent He had not yet been desired by all nations. For they knew not Him whom they ought to desire, in whom they had not believed. Then, also, according to the Septuagint interpretation (for it also is a prophetic meaning), shall come those who are elected of the Lord out of all nations. For then indeed there shall come only those who are elected, whereof the apostle saith, According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world. For the Master Builder who said, Many are called, but few are chosen, did not say this of those who, on being called, came in such a way as to be cast out from the feast, but would point out the house built up of the elect, which henceforth shall dread no ruin. Yet because the churches are also full of those who shall be separated by the winnowing as in the threshing-floor, the glory of this house is not so apparent now as it shall be when every one who is there shall be there always. </p>                        </div>

We acknowledge, indeed, that His word is now fulfilled who spake in the psalm, and said, I have announced and spoken; they are multiplied above number.

He had one among them whose wickedness He could use well in order to accomplish His appointed passion, and furnish His Church an example of bearing with the wicked. Having sown the holy gospel as much as that behoved to be done by His bodily presence, He suffered, died, and rose again, showing by His passion what we ought to suffer for the truth, and by His resurrection what we ought to hope for in adversity; saving always the mystery of the sacrament, by which His blood was shed for the remission of sins. He held converse on the earth forty days with His disciples, and in their sight ascended into heaven, and after ten days sent the promised Holy Spirit. It was given as the chief and most necessary sign of His coming on those who had believed, that every one of them spoke in the tongues of all nations; thus signifying that the unity of the catholic Church would embrace all nations, and would in like manner speak in all tongues. </p>                        </div>

For without doubt the divine providence procures for her both consolation through prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity, and trial through adversity, that she may not be corrupted by prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we recognize in the Psalms that voice which arises from no other cause, According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have delighted my soul. Hence also is that saying of the apostle, Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation. For it is not to be thought that what the same teacher says can at any time fail, Whoever will live piously in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> shall suffer persecution. Because even when those who are without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and really is, tranquillity, which brings very much consolation, especially to the weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there are many within who by their abandoned manners torment the hearts of those who live piously, since by them the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer that name is to those who will live piously in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, the more do they grieve that through the wicked, who have a place within, it comes to be less loved than pious minds desire. The heretics themselves also, since they are thought to have the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> name and sacraments, Scriptures, and profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both because many who wish to be <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> are compelled by their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find in them matter for blaspheming the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> name, because they too are at any rate called <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>. By these and similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will live piously in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> suffer persecution, even when no one molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this persecution, not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word, According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart; for he does not say, in my body. Yet, on the other hand, none of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises are thought of. And because the apostle says, The Lord knoweth them that are His; for whom He did foreknow, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, none of them can perish; therefore it follows in that psalm, Thy consolations have delighted my soul. But that grief which arises in the hearts of the pious, who are persecuted by the manners of bad or false <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, is profitable to the sufferers, because it proceeds from the charity in which they do not wish them either to perish or to hinder the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations grow out of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of the pious with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world, in these evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> and His apostles, but even from that of <a href=/people/5395 target=_blank>Abel</a>, whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous, and thenceforth even to the end of this world, the Church has gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God. </p>                        </div>

I do not think, indeed, that what some have thought or may think is rashly said or believed, that until the time of Antichrist the Church of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> is not to suffer any persecutions besides those she has already suffered,-that is, ten,-and that the eleventh and last shall be inflicted by Antichrist. They reckon as the first that made by <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, the second by <a href=/people/516 target=_blank>Domitian</a>, the third by <a href=/people/207 target=_blank>Trajan</a>, the fourth by <a href=/people/12361 target=_blank>Antoninus</a>, the fifth by <a href=/people/11085 target=_blank>Severus</a>, the sixth by Maximin, the seventh by <a href=/people/869 target=_blank>Decius</a>, the eighth by <a href=/people/12175 target=_blank>Valerian</a>, the ninth by <a href=/people/11044 target=_blank>Aurelian</a> the tenth by <a href=/people/1446 target=_blank>Diocletian</a> and <a href=/people/3044 target=_blank>Maximian</a>. For as there were ten plagues in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a> before the people of God could begin to go out, they think this is to be referred to as showing that the last persecution by Antichrist must be like the eleventh plague, in which the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=ethnic long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egyptians</a>, while following the <a href=/people/179 target=_blank>Hebrews</a> with hostility, perished in the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/195390WEry class=place long=39 lat=19.5>Red Sea</a> when the people of God passed through on dry land. Yet I do not think persecutions were prophetically signified by what was done in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy class=place long=30.7 lat=27.1>Egypt</a>, however nicely and ingeniously those who think so may seem to have compared the two in detail, not by the prophetic Spirit, but by the conjecture of the human mind, which sometimes hits the truth, and sometimes is deceived. But what can those who think this say of the persecution in which the Lord Himself was crucified? In which number will they put it? And if they think the reckoning is to be made exclusive of this one, as if those must be counted which pertain to the body, and not that in which the Head Himself was set upon and slain, what can they make of that one which, after <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> ascended into heaven, took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>, when the blessed Stephen was stoned; when James the brother of John was slaughtered with the sword; when the Apostle Peter was imprisoned to be killed, and was set free by the angel; when the brethren were driven away and scattered from <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; when Saul, who afterward became the Apostle Paul, wasted the Church; and when he himself, publishing the glad tidings of the faith he had persecuted, suffered such things as he had inflicted, either from the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> or from other nations, where he most fervently preached <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> everywhere? Why, then, do they think fit to start with <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a>, when the Church in her growth had reached the times of <a href=/people/66 target=_blank>Nero</a> amid the most cruel persecutions; about which it would be too long to say anything? But if they think that only the persecutions made by kings ought to be reckoned, it was king <a href=/people/1562 target=_blank>Herod</a> who also made a most grievous one after the ascension of the Lord. And what account do they give of <a href=/people/12209 target=_blank>Julian</a>, whom they do not number in the ten? Did not he persecute the Church, who forbade the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> to teach or learn liberal letters? Under him the elder <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, who was the third emperor after him, stood forth as a confessor of the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> faith, and was dismissed from his command in the army. I shall say nothing of what he did at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/362362PAnt class=place long=36.165 lat=36.2>Antioch</a>, except to mention his being struck with wonder at the freedom and cheerfulness of one most faithful and steadfast young man, who, when many were seized to be tortured, was tortured during a whole day, and sang under the instrument of torture, until the emperor feared lest he should succumb under the continued cruelties and put him to shame at last, which made him dread and fear that he would be yet more dishonorably put to the blush by the rest. Lastly, within our own recollection, did not <a href=/people/466 target=_blank>Valens</a> the Arian, brother of the foresaid <a href=/people/614 target=_blank>Valentinian</a>, waste the catholic Church by great persecution throughout the East? But how unreasonable it is not to consider that the Church, which bears fruit and grows through the whole world, may suffer persecution from kings in some nations even when she does not suffer it in others! Perhaps, however, it was not to be reckoned a persecution when the king of the <a href=/people/1095 target=_blank>Goths</a>, in Gothia itself, persecuted the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> with wonderful cruelty, when there were none but catholics there, of whom very many were crowned with martyrdom, as we have heard from certain brethren who had been there at that time as boys, and unhesitatingly called to mind that they had seen these things? And what took place in <a about=https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer class=place long=54 lat=29.5>Persia</a> of late? Was not persecution so hot against the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> (if even yet it is allayed) that some of the fugitives from it came even to Roman towns? When I think of these and the like things, it does not seem to me that the number of persecutions with which the Church is to be tried can be definitely stated. But, on the other hand, it is no less rash to affirm that there will be some persecutions by kings besides that last one, about which no <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> is in doubt. Therefore we leave this undecided, supporting or refuting neither side of this question, but only restraining men from the audacious presumption of affirming either of them. </p>                        </div>

Truly Jesus Himself shall extinguish by His presence that last persecution which is to be made by Antichrist. For so it is written, that He shall slay him with the breath of His mouth, and empty him with the brightness of His presence. It is customary to ask, When shall that be? But this is quite unreasonable. For had it been profitable for us to know this, by whom could it better have been told than by God Himself, the Master, when the disciples questioned Him? For they were not silent when with Him, but inquired of Him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time present the kingdom to <a href=/people/532 target=_blank>Israel</a>, or when? But He said, It is not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power. When they got that answer, they had not at all questioned Him about the hour, or day, or year, but about the time. In vain, then, do we attempt to compute definitely the years that may remain to this world, when we may hear from the mouth of the Truth that it is not for us to know this. Yet some have said that four hundred, some five hundred, others a thousand years, may be completed from the ascension of the Lord up to His final coming. But to point out how each of them supports his own opinion would take too long, and is not necessary; for indeed they use human conjectures, and bring forward nothing certain from the authority of the canonical Scriptures. But on this subject He puts aside the figures of the calculators, and orders silence, who says, It is not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power. But because this sentence is in the Gospel, it is no wonder that the worshippers of the many and false gods have been none the less restrained from feigning that by the responses of the demons, whom they worship as gods, it has been fixed how long the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> religion is to last. For when they saw that it could not be consumed by so many and great persecutions, but rather drew from them wonderful enlargements, they invented I know not what Greek verses, as if poured forth by a divine oracle to some one consulting it, in which, indeed, they make <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> innocent of this, as it were, sacrilegious crime, but add that Peter by enchantments brought it about that the name of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> should be worshipped for three hundred and sixty-five years, and, after the completion of that number of years, should at once take end. Oh the hearts of learned men! Oh, learned wits, meet to believe such things about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> as you are not willing to believe in <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, that His disciple Peter did not learn magic arts from Him, yet that, although He was innocent, His disciple was an enchanter, and chose that His name rather than his own should be worshipped through his magic arts, his great labors and perils, and at last even the shedding of his blood! If Peter the enchanter made the world so love <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, what did <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> the innocent do to make Peter so love Him? Let them answer themselves then, and, if they can, let them understand that the world, for the sake of eternal life, was made to love <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> by that same supernal grace which made Peter also love <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> for the sake of the eternal life to be received from Him, and that even to the extent of suffering temporal death for Him. And then, what kind of gods are these who are able to predict such things, yet are not able to avert them, succumbing in such a way to a single enchanter and wicked magician (who, as they say, having slain a yearling boy and torn him to pieces, buried him with nefarious rites), that they permitted the sect hostile to themselves to gain strength for so great a time, and to surmount the horrid cruelties of so many great persecutions, not by resisting but by suffering, and to procure the overthrow of their own images, temples, rituals, and oracles? Finally, what god was it-not ours, certainly, but one of their own-who was either enticed or compelled by so great wickedness to perform these things? For those verses say that Peter bound, not any demon, but a god to do these things. Such a god have they who have not <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>. </p>                        </div>

I might collect these and many similar arguments, if that year had not already passed by which lying divination has promised, and deceived vanity has believed. But as a few years ago three hundred and sixty-five years were completed since the time when the worship of the name of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> was established by His presence in the flesh, and by the apostles, what other proof need we seek to refute that falsehood? For, not to place the beginning of this period at the nativity of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, because as an infant and boy He had no disciples, yet, when He began to have them, beyond doubt the <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> doctrine and religion then became known through His bodily presence, that is, after He was baptized in the river <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318355WJor class=place long=35.5465 lat=31.837>Jordan</a> by the ministry of John. For on this account that prophecy went before concerning Him: He shall reign from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. But since, before He suffered and rose from the dead, the faith had not yet been defined to all, but was defined in the resurrection of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> (for so the Apostle Paul speaks to the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth class=ethnic long=23.72793 lat=37.9718>Athenians</a>, saying, But now He announces to men that all everywhere should repent, because He hath appointed a day in which to judge the world in equity, by the Man in whom He hath defined the faith to all men, raising Him from the dead ), it is better that, in settling this question, we should start from that point, especially because the Holy Spirit was then given, just as He behoved to be given after the resurrection of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> in that city from which the second law, that is, the new testament, ought to begin. For the first, which is called the old testament was given from Mount <a about=https://topostext.org/place/299339RSin class=place long=33.9 lat=29.9>Sinai</a> through <a href=/people/11035 target=_blank>Moses</a>. But concerning this which was to be given by <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> it was predicted, Out of <a href=/people/3694 target=_blank>Sion</a> shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord out of <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>; whence He Himself said that repentance in His name behoved to be preached among all nations, but yet beginning at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a>. There, therefore, the worship of this name took its rise, that Jesus should be believed in, who died and rose again. There this faith blazed up with such noble beginnings, that several thousand men, being converted to the name of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> with wonderful alacrity, sold their goods for distribution among the needy, thus, by a holy resolution and most ardent charity, coming to voluntary poverty, and prepared themselves, amid the <a href=/people/7828 target=_blank>Jews</a> who raged and thirsted for their blood, to contend for the truth even to death, not with armed power, but with more powerful patience. If this was accomplished by no magic arts, why do they hesitate to believe that the other could be done throughout the whole world by the same divine power by which this was done? But supposing Peter wrought that enchantment so that so great a multitude of men at <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352PJer class=place long=35.2341 lat=31.7751>Jerusalem</a> was thus kindled to worship the name of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, who had either seized and fastened Him to the cross, or reviled Him when fastened there, we must still inquire when the three hundred and sixty-five years must be completed, counting from that year. Now <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> died when the Gemini were consuls, on the eighth day before the kalends of April. He rose the third day, as the apostles have proved by the evidence of their own senses. Then forty days after, He ascended into heaven. Ten days after, that is, on the fiftieth after his resurrection, He sent the Holy Spirit; then three thousand men believed when the apostles preached Him. Then, therefore, arose the worship of that name, as we believe, and according to the real truth, by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, but, as impious vanity has reigned or thought, by the magic arts of Peter. A little afterward, too, on a wonderful sign being wrought, when at Peter's own word a certain beggar, so lame from his mother's womb that he was carried by others and laid down at the gate of the <a about=https://topostext.org/place/318352STem class=place long=35.2353 lat=31.778>temple</a>, where he begged alms, was made whole in the name of Jesus <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, and leaped up, five thousand men believed, and thenceforth the Church grew by sundry accessions of believers. Thus we gather the very day with which that year began, namely, that on which the Holy Spirit was sent, that is, during the ides of May. And, on counting the consuls, the three hundred and sixty-five years are found completed on the same ides in the consulate of <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a> and Eutychianus. Now, in the following year, in the consulate of <a href=/people/2893 target=_blank>Mallius</a> <a href=/people/240 target=_blank>Theodorus</a>, when, according to that oracle of the demons or figment of men, there ought already to have been no <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christian</a> religion, it was not necessary to inquire, what perchance was done in other parts of the earth. But, as we know, in the most noted and eminent city, <a about=https://topostext.org/place/369103PCar class=place long=10.32 lat=36.85>Carthage</a>, in Africa, <a href=/people/3603 target=_blank>Gaudentius</a> and Jovius, officers of the Emperor <a href=/people/7775 target=_blank>Honorius</a>, on the fourteenth day before the kalends of April, overthrew the temples and broke the images of the false gods. And from that time to the present, during almost thirty years, who does not see how much the worship of the name of <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> has increased, especially after many of those became <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a> who had been kept back from the faith by thinking that divination true, but saw when that same number of years was completed that it was empty and ridiculous? We, therefore, who are called and are <a href=/people/455 target=_blank>Christians</a>, do not believe in Peter, but in Him whom Peter believed,-being edified by Peter's sermons about <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a>, not poisoned by his incantations; and not deceived by his enchantments, but aided by his good deeds. <a href=/people/111 target=_blank>Christ</a> Himself, who was Peter's Master in the doctrine which leads to eternal life, is our Master too. But let us now at last finish this book, after thus far treating of, and showing as far as seemed sufficient, what is the mortal course of the two cities, the heavenly and the earthly, which are mingled together from the beginning down to the end. Of these, the earthly one has made to herself of whom she would, either from any other quarter, or even from among men, false gods whom she might serve by sacrifice; but she which is heavenly and is a pilgrim on the earth does not make false gods, but is herself made by the true God of, whom she herself must be the true sacrifice. Yet both alike either enjoy temporal good things, or are afflicted with temporal evils, but with diverse faith, diverse hope, and diverse love, until they must be separated by the last judgment, and each must receive her own end, of which there is no end. About these ends of both we must next treat. </p>                        </div>
